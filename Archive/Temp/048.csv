The underlying mechanisms of ATRA therapeutic effects have not been entirely clarified. Here, we reported that the regulation of neddylation, a ubiquitination-like post-translational modification, was involved in the treatment of ATRA on APL. Treating APL cells with ATRA led to the degradation of UBA3, a subunit of neddylation E1. Lysosome-autophagy pathway but not proteasome pathway was responsible for the degradation of UBA3. Neddylation suppression in APL cells was capable of inducing apoptosis, differentiation and proliferation inhibition, suggesting a pivotal role of neddylation in APL cells. ATRA treatment also led to UBA3 degradation in primary APL cells. Taken together, our findings indicated that neddylation was important to maintain the malignant features of APL cells, and suppression of neddylation was involved in the effects of ATRA on APL cells.","['Cao, Huanling', 'Xie, Jing', 'Guo, Lu', 'Han, Kun', 'Pei, Yujun', 'Li, Xin', 'Qiu, Guihua', 'Jin, Jiayang', 'Hua, Lei', 'Jing, Zhaofei', 'Wu, Huifang', 'Liu, Jian', 'Wang, Jing', 'Shen, Beifen', 'Tang, Suoqin', 'Zhang, Jiyan', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Chen, Hu', 'Wang, Qingyang']","['Cao H', 'Xie J', 'Guo L', 'Han K', 'Pei Y', 'Li X', 'Qiu G', 'Jin J', 'Hua L', 'Jing Z', 'Wu H', 'Liu J', 'Wang J', 'Shen B', 'Tang S', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang J', 'Chen H', 'Wang Q']","['a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'b Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering , Henan University , Kaifeng , China.', 'c Center of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation , Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'b Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering , Henan University , Kaifeng , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'b Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering , Henan University , Kaifeng , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', ""d Department of Pediatrics , General Hospital of People's Liberation Army , Beijing , China."", 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'b Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering , Henan University , Kaifeng , China.', 'c Center of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation , Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.', 'a Department of Molecular Immunology , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , Beijing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170829,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NEDD8 Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (NAE protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'NEDD8 Protein/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*APL', '*ATRA', '*UBA3', '*autophagy', '*neddylation']",2017/08/30 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1365850 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 May;59(5):1222-1230. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1365850.

Leukaemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) promotes tumour cell growth. This study tests a hypothesis that LRF inhibits p53 expression in colon cancer cells. In this study, human colon cancer cell lines, LIM1215 and HCT116 cells, were used. The expression of LRF and p53 in the cells was analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. We observed that the expression of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) was detected in both LIM1215 and HCT116 human colon cancer cells. Activation of PAR2 increased the expression of LRF and inhibited the p53 expression in the cancer cells. We also detected a complex of LRF and DAP5, one of the p53 gene transcription factors. The interaction of LRF and DAP5 resulted in the repression of p53 expression in the colon cancer cells. In conclusion, PAR2 activation increases the expression of LRF in colon cancer cells, which interacts with DAP5 to repress the p53 expression. Leukaemia/lymphoma-related factor may be a novel target in the treatment of colon cancer.","['Zhu, Min', 'Wang, Peng', 'Feng, Fan', 'Li, Ming-Yang']","['Zhu M', 'Wang P', 'Feng F', 'Li MY']","['Department of Oncology, Nan Lou Division, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Nan Lou Division, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Research Center for Clinical and Translational Medicine, The 302nd Hospital of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170828,England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EIF4G2 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, PAR-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptor, PAR-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['DAP5', 'LRF', 'apoptosis', 'colon cancer', 'p53 protein']",2017/08/30 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.3287 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2017 Oct;35(7):401-406. doi: 10.1002/cbf.3287.

However, a number of patients have failed to respond or experienced disease relapse following TKI treatment. Proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus1 (PIM1) is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in regulating apoptosis, cell cycle, signal transduction and transcriptional pathways, which are associated with tumor progression, and poor prognosis. SMI4a is a selective PIM1 kinase inhibitor that inhibits PIM1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro. The present study aimed to explore the mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of SMI4a in K562 and imatinibresistant K562 (K562/G) cell lines. It was demonstrated that SMI4a inhibited the proliferation of K562 and K562/G cells using a WST8 assay. The Annexin Vpropidium iodide assay demonstrated that SMI4a induced apoptosis of K562 and K562/G cells in a dose, and timedependent manner. Furthermore, Hoechst 33342 staining was used to verify the apoptosis rate. The clone formation assay revealed that SMI4a significantly inhibited the colony formation capacity of K562 and K562/G cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that SMI4a decreased phosphorylated (p)Ser9glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3beta/pGSK3beta and inhibited the translocation of betacatenin. In addition, the downstream gene expression of apoptosis regulator Bax and poly(ADPribose) polymerase1 was upregulated, and apoptosis regulator Bcl2 and Myc protooncogene protein expression levels were downregulated. Immunofluorescence results demonstrated changes in the expression level of betacatenin in the plasma and nucleus. The results of the present study suggest that SMI4a is an effective drug to use in combination with current chemotherapeutics for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.","['Fan, Rui-Fang', 'Lu, Ying', 'Fang, Zhi-Gang', 'Guo, Xiao-Yan', 'Chen, Yu-Xin', 'Xu, Yi-Chuan', 'Lei, Ya-Mei', 'Liu, Ke-Fang', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Liu, Ling-Ling', 'Liu, Xiang-Fu']","['Fan RF', 'Lu Y', 'Fang ZG', 'Guo XY', 'Chen YX', 'Xu YC', 'Lei YM', 'Liu KF', 'Lin DJ', 'Liu LL', 'Liu XF']","['Department of Hematology, Sun Yatsen Institute of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, P.R.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and luciferase reporter assay revealed that GATA4 was a transcription factor that activated mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) expression in ALL cells. BCL2 is a key antiapoptosis protein that was demonstrated to suppress cell apoptosis.

Given that terminal differentiation represents a considerable barrier in retinoblastoma tumorigenesis and that retinoblastoma has a significantly higher spontaneous degeneration rate compared with other tumors (1,000-fold change), differentiation therapy represents a promising alternative in the treatment of retinoblastoma. However, the full differentiation potential of retinoblastoma still unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the extend differentiation of the classical retinoblastoma cell line WERI-Rb-1 (W-RBCs). Several critical cell signaling pathways and key genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation were comprehensively regulated to control the fate of W-RBCs. Various strategies were applied to optimize simple and time-saving methods to induce W-RBCs into different types of retinal neuron-like cells (RNLCs) in vitro. Further, the tumorigenesis of these differentiated W-RBCs was tested in nude mice in vivo. W-RBCs were found to inherently express both retinal progenitor cell- and embryonic stem cell-related genes or proteins. Moreover, the addition of antagonists of critical cell signals (Wnt, Nodal, BMP4 and Notch), even without atonal bHLH transcription factor 7 gene transfection, could directly induce W-RBCs into RNLCs, and especially into photoreceptor-like and retinal ganglion-like cells. Interestingly, the differentiated cells showed remarkably poorer tumorigenesis in vivo. These findings may offer new insights on the oriented differentiation of W-RBCs into RNLCs with low tumorigenicity and provide potential targets for retinoblastoma differentiation therapy.","['Liu, Ying', 'Hu, Huiling', 'Liang, Meixin', 'Xiong, Yunfan', 'Li, Kang', 'Chen, Mengfei', 'Fan, Zhigang', 'Kuang, Xielan', 'Deng, Fei', 'Liu, Xiaohong', 'Xu, Chaochao', 'Li, Kaijing', 'Ge, Jian']","['Liu Y', 'Hu H', 'Liang M', 'Xiong Y', 'Li K', 'Chen M', 'Fan Z', 'Kuang X', 'Deng F', 'Liu X', 'Xu C', 'Li K', 'Ge J']","['State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510060, P.R.

However, resistance to IM usually occurs in CML patients. The bone marrow (BM), as the predominant microenvironment of CML, secretes an abundant amount of cytokines, which may contribute to drug resistance. In current study, we utilized in vitro K562 co-culture model with BM stroma to investigate IM resistance. As a result, co-culturing of K562 with BM stroma was sufficient to cause resistance to IM, which was accompanied with the activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and upregulation of BCR-ABL as well as its downstream proteins like phosphorylated Akt, Bcl-xL and survivin, etc. On the other hand, oroxyloside A (OAG), a metabolite of oroxylin A from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, which had low toxic effect on K562 cells, was able to sensitize K562 cells co-cultured with BM stroma to IM treatment in vitro and in vivo. We observed that OAG suppressed Hh pathway and subsequently nuclear translocation of GLI1, followed by downregulation of BCR-ABL and its downstream effectors, thus facilitating IM to induce apoptosis of K562 cells. Together, BM microenvironment rendered K562 cells drug resistance through activating Hh signaling, however, OAG could overcome IM resistance of CML cells through inhibiting Hh-BCR-ABL axis in vitro and in vivo.","['Zhang, Xiaobo', 'Liu, Yicheng', 'Lu, Lu', 'Huang, Shaoliang', 'Ding, Youxiang', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Zhao, Li']","['Zhang X', 'Liu Y', 'Lu L', 'Huang S', 'Ding Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Guo Q', 'Li Z', 'Zhao L']","['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical UniversityNanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170811,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Oroxyloside A', 'cell co-culture', 'drug resistance', 'hedgehog pathway', 'microenvironment']",2017/08/30 06:00,2017/08/30 06:01,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2017.00526 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2017 Aug 11;8:526. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00526. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5554535,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present an unbiased systems-approach to interrogate a panel of 14 well-annotated HGS-OvCa patient-derived xenografts for sensitivity to PI3K and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and uncover cell death vulnerabilities. Proteomic analysis reveals that PI3K/mTOR inhibition in HGS-OvCa patient-derived xenografts induces both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling responses that limit cell killing, but also primes cells for inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins. In-depth quantitative analysis of BCL-2 family proteins and other apoptotic regulators, together with computational modeling and selective anti-apoptotic protein inhibitors, uncovers new mechanistic details about apoptotic regulators that are predictive of drug sensitivity (BIM, caspase-3, BCL-XL) and resistance (MCL-1, XIAP). Our systems-approach presents a strategy for systematic analysis of the mechanisms that limit effective tumor cell killing and the identification of apoptotic vulnerabilities to overcome drug resistance in ovarian and other cancers.High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGS-OvCa) frequently develop chemotherapy resistance. Here, the authors through a systematic analysis of proteomic and drug response data of 14 HGS-OvCa PDXs demonstrate that targeting apoptosis regulators can improve response of these tumors to inhibitors of the PI3K/mTOR pathway.","['Zervantonakis, Ioannis K', 'Iavarone, Claudia', 'Chen, Hsing-Yu', 'Selfors, Laura M', 'Palakurthi, Sangeetha', 'Liu, Joyce F', 'Drapkin, Ronny', 'Matulonis, Ursula', 'Leverson, Joel D', 'Sampath, Deepak', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Brugge, Joan S']","['Zervantonakis IK', 'Iavarone C', 'Chen HY', 'Selfors LM', 'Palakurthi S', 'Liu JF', 'Drapkin R', 'Matulonis U', 'Leverson JD', 'Sampath D', 'Mills GB', 'Brugge JS']","['Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Research, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Penn Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Translational Oncology, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, 94080, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. joan_brugge@hms.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170828,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Systems Biology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2017/08/30 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-017-00263-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-017-00263-7 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2017 Aug 28;8(1):365. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00263-7.,['P50 CA217685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2386-9553', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6912-6977']",PMC5573720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Len maintenance led to a superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared with no maintenance (median, 37 vs 28 months, respectively; P=0.002; adjusted hazard ratio 0.48 (95% CI, 0.35-0.66)), including in subgroups with ISS stage III disease (median, 40 vs 24 months; P=0.008) and high-risk cytogenetics (median, 27 vs 16 months; P=0.032). Bort maintenance did not confer PFS benefit for the entire cohort, but improved PFS in the high-risk cytogenetic subgroup (median, 28 vs 16 months; P=0.035). Discontinuation due to toxicity was seen in 17 and 7% of patients receiving Len or Bort maintenance, respectively. Our results indicate that post-transplant maintenance with Len or Bort is well tolerated in clinical practice and improves PFS in high-risk subgroups of MM patients.","['Chakraborty, R', 'Muchtar, E', 'Kumar, S K', 'Buadi, F K', 'Dingli, D', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Hayman, S R', 'Hogan, W J', 'Kapoor, P', 'Lacy, M Q', 'Leung, N', 'Warsame, R', 'Kourelis, T', 'Gonsalves, W', 'Gertz, M A']","['Chakraborty R', 'Muchtar E', 'Kumar SK', 'Buadi FK', 'Dingli D', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Hayman SR', 'Hogan WJ', 'Kapoor P', 'Lacy MQ', 'Leung N', 'Warsame R', 'Kourelis T', 'Gonsalves W', 'Gertz MA']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170814,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lenalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/08/30 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017256 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.256 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Mar;32(3):712-718. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.256.

Whether and how CycG1 regulates polyploidization caused by small molecular targeted inhibitors remains unclear. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were utilized to examine protein expression. Cell proliferation was measured by ATPlite assay, and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry and/or DNA fragmentation assays. RESULTS: Overexpression of CycG1 in breast cancer cells caused apoptosis-resistant polyploidy upon treatment with Aurora kinase inhibitor, ZM447439 (ZM). Addition of ABT-263, a small-molecule BH3 mimetic, to ZM, produced a synergistic loss of cell viability with greater sustained tumor growth inhibition in breast cancer cell lines. Decrease of Mcl-1 and increase of NOXA caused by ZM treatment, were responsible for the synergy. Furthermore, CycG1 was highly expressed in Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer patients treated with paclitaxel and was paralleled by decreased cell survival. CONCLUSION: CycG1 is a crucial factor in ZM-induced polyploidy resistance, and ABT-263/ZM combination hold therapeutic utility in the CycG1-amplified subset of breast cancer and CycG1, thus, is a promising target in breast cancer.","['Zhang, Wenfeng', 'Xu, Jie', 'Ji, Dexiang', 'Li, Zhangyun', 'He, Wenxing', 'Yang, Fei', 'Lan, Huiyin', 'Wang, Yu', 'Wu, Zhengping', 'Liu, Xiaoshan', 'Huang, Shanhua', 'Li, Longkun', 'Zhou, Weihua']","['Zhang W', 'Xu J', 'Ji D', 'Li Z', 'He W', 'Yang F', 'Lan H', 'Wang Y', 'Wu Z', 'Liu X', 'Huang S', 'Li L', 'Zhou W']","['Department of Infectious Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Urology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, the Third Hospital of Nanchang, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, Jiangxi Province Tumor Hospital, Nanchang, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Urology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170825,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0', '(4-(4-(N-benzoylamino)anilino)-6-methoxy-7-(3-(1-morpholino)propoxy)quinazoline)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclin G1)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aniline Compounds/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin G1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polyploidy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/toxicity', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2 family', 'Breast Cancer', 'CyclinG1', 'Polyploidy', 'Resistance', 'Targeted therapy']",2017/08/30 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['000480322 [pii]', '10.1159/000480322 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;43(1):94-107. doi: 10.1159/000480322.

Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor; bortezomib can indirectly inhibit MCL-1. In preclinical studies, venetoclax enhanced bortezomib activity, suggesting that cotargeting of BCL-2 and MCL-1 could be an effective treatment strategy in myeloma. This phase 1b trial studied patients with relapsed/refractory MM receiving daily venetoclax (50-1200 mg per designated dose cohort; 800 mg in safety expansion) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. A total of 66 patients were enrolled (54 in the dose-escalation cohorts and 12 in the safety expansion). Patients had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-13); 26 (39%) were refractory to prior bortezomib and 35 (53%) to lenalidomide; 39 (59%) had prior stem cell transplant. The combination was generally well tolerated, and common adverse events included mild gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhea [46%], constipation [41%], and nausea [38%]) and grade 3/4 cytopenias (thrombocytopenia [29%] and anemia [15%]). The overall response rate (ORR) was 67% (44/66); 42% achieved very good partial response or better (>/=VGPR). Median time to progression and duration of response were 9.5 and 9.7 months, respectively. ORR of 97% and >/=VGPR 73% were seen in patients not refractory to bortezomib who had 1 to 3 prior therapies. Patients with high BCL2 expression had a higher ORR (94% [17/18]) than patients with low BCL2 expression (59% [16/27]). This novel combination of venetoclax with bortezomib and dexamethasone has an acceptable safety profile and promising efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory MM.

Instead, they populate ensembles of rapidly interconverting conformations with marginal structural stabilities. Changes in solution conditions such as temperature and crowding agents consequently affect IDPs more than their folded counterparts. Here we reveal that the residual structure content of IDPs is modulated both by ionic strength and by the type of ions present in solution. We show that these ion-specific structural changes result in binding affinity shifts of up to sixfold, which happen through alteration of both association and dissociation rates. These effects follow the Hofmeister series, but unlike the well-established effects on the stability of folded proteins, they already occur at low, hypotonic concentrations of salt. We attribute this sensitivity to the marginal stability of IDPs, which could have physiological implications given the role of IDPs in signaling, the asymmetric ion profiles of different cellular compartments, and the role of ions in biology.","['Wicky, Basile I M', 'Shammas, Sarah L', 'Clarke, Jane']","['Wicky BIM', 'Shammas SL', 'Clarke J']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom sarah.shammas@bioch.ox.ac.uk jc162@cam.ac.uk.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom sarah.shammas@bioch.ox.ac.uk jc162@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170828,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Intrinsically Disordered Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Stability', 'Solutions/chemistry', 'Spectrin/*metabolism', 'Static Electricity', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PPI', '*co-solute', '*electrostatic steering', '*folding upon binding', '*protein stability']",2017/08/30 06:00,2018/06/01 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['1705105114 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1705105114 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Sep 12;114(37):9882-9887. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1705105114.

AIMS: To evaluate the epidemiology of acute disseminated candidiasis with skin lesions in neutropenic patients, taking into consideration changes caused by different prophylactic strategies. SOURCES: A systematic review of English-language articles found via PubMed (1963-2016) was performed. We asked the following questions: (a) What Candida species are more frequently involved in this syndrome? (b) Has antifungal prophylaxis changed the species causing skin lesions? (c) What are the typical patterns of skin lesions? (d) What is the frequency of skin lesions in neutropenic patients with candidaemia or acute disseminated candidiasis? (e) Has antifungal prophylaxis decreased the incidence of acute disseminated candidiasis with skin lesions? CONTENT: Among 183 studies, 33 were selected, reporting 100 cases of acute disseminated candidiasis with skin lesions in neutropenic patients. It occurred more frequently in the setting of induction therapy for de novo or relapsed acute leukaemia, and the most frequent Candida species were C. tropicalis (68%) and C. krusei (15%). Diffuse maculopapular lesions predominated in cases caused by C. tropicalis and nodular and papular lesions in cases caused by C. krusei. Prophylaxis with fluconazole was reported in six cases, C. krusei in five and C. ciferrii in one. The death rate was 45.4%. IMPLICATIONS: Two patterns were recognized: disseminated maculopapular lesions caused by C. tropicalis in patients not receiving fluconazole prophylaxis, occurring in 39% to 44% of neutropenic patients with acute disseminated candidiasis, and nodular lesions caused by C. krusei in patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis, occurring less frequently.","['Guarana, M', 'Nucci, M']","['Guarana M', 'Nucci M']","['University Hospital, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the BCR-ABL1 [international reporting scale (IS)] transcript levels at 3 and 6 months to determine whether an early molecular response (EMR) had a prognostic effect on the outcome among chronic myeloid leukemia patients receiving GI. Ninety patients were divided into 2 groups, according to the imatinib they received, as OI (group A) and GI (group B). RESULTS: Two groups were equally balanced for age, gender, Sokal risk score, and optimal response. The 2 groups did not differ in achieving an EMR at 3 months, and patients with EMR at 3 months had significantly superior complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response rates compared with patients who did not achieve an EMR in both groups. The percentage of an optimal response [BCR-ABL1 (IS), < 1%] and a warning response [BCR-ABL1 (IS), 1%-10%] at 6 months was 93% and 95% for groups A and B, respectively (P = .553). Patients with an optimal response (OR) at both 3 and 6 months had significantly superior event-free survival rates compared with patients without an OR in groups A and B. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study have demonstrated most probably for the first time that an OR at 3 and 6 months in patients receiving either first-line GI and OI is clearly associated with greater response and event-free survival rates. Prospective randomized trials with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up periods are needed to address the effect of EMR in patients receiving GI.","['Eskazan, Ahmet Emre', 'Sadri, Sevil', 'Keskin, Dilek', 'Ayer, Mesut', 'Kantarcioglu, Bulent', 'Demirel, Naciye', 'Aydin, Demet', 'Aydinli, Fuat', 'Yokus, Osman', 'Ozunal, Isil Erdogan', 'Berk, Selin', 'Yalniz, Fevzi Firat', 'Elverdi, Tugrul', 'Salihoglu, Ayse', 'Ar, Muhlis Cem', 'Ongoren, Seniz', 'Baslar, Zafer', 'Aydin, Yildiz', 'Tuzuner, Nukhet', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Soysal, Teoman']","['Eskazan AE', 'Sadri S', 'Keskin D', 'Ayer M', 'Kantarcioglu B', 'Demirel N', 'Aydin D', 'Aydinli F', 'Yokus O', 'Ozunal IE', 'Berk S', 'Yalniz FF', 'Elverdi T', 'Salihoglu A', 'Ar MC', 'Ongoren S', 'Baslar Z', 'Aydin Y', 'Tuzuner N', 'Ozbek U', 'Soysal T']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Haseki Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.

MicroRNA miR-661 downregulates mouse double minute homologue 2 (MDM2) and MDM4 in other epithelial cell types to activate p53; however, this has not been examined in the endometrium. In this study MDM2 protein was detected in the luminal epithelium of the endometrium, the site of blastocyst attachment, during the mid secretory receptive phase of the menstrual cycle. The effects of miR-661 on gene expression in and adhesion of endometrial cells was also examined. MiR-661 overexpression consistently downregulated MDM2 but not MDM4 or p53 gene expression in the Ishikawa endometrial epithelial cell line and primary HEEC. Adhesion assays were performed on the real-time monitoring xCELLigence system and by co-culture using Ishikawa cells and HEECs with HTR8/SVneo trophoblast spheroids. Targeted siRNA-mediated knockdown of MDM2 in endometrial epithelial cells reduced Ishikawa cell adhesion (P<0.001) and also reduced HTR8/SVneo trophoblast spheroid adhesion to Ishikawa cells (P<0.05) and HEECs (P<0.05). MDM2 overexpression using recombinant protein treatment resulted in enhanced HTR8/SVneo trophoblast spheroid adhesion to Ishikawa cells (P<0.01) and HEECs (P<0.05). This study highlights a potential new mechanism by which human blastocyst-secreted miR-661 reduces endometrial epithelial cell adhesion; via downregulation of MDM2. These findings suggest that MDM2 contributes to endometrial-blastocyst adhesion, implantation and infertility in women.","['Winship, Amy', 'Ton, Amanda', 'Van Sinderen, Michelle', 'Menkhorst, Ellen', 'Rainczuk, Katarzyna', 'Griffiths, Meaghan', 'Cuman, Carly', 'Dimitriadis, Evdokia']","['Winship A', 'Ton A', 'Van Sinderen M', 'Menkhorst E', 'Rainczuk K', 'Griffiths M', 'Cuman C', 'Dimitriadis E']","['Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.', 'Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.', 'Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.', 'Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.', 'Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.', 'Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.', 'Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.', 'Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN661 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Blastocyst/*metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Paracrine Communication', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/08/30 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['RD17095 [pii]', '10.1071/RD17095 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2018 Mar;30(3):477-486. doi: 10.1071/RD17095.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADA-SCID is fatal early in life if untreated. Unconditioned hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant from matched sibling donor represents a curative treatment but is available for few patients. Enzyme replacement therapy can be life-saving, but its chronic use has many drawbacks. This review summarizes the history of ADA-SCID GT over the last 25 years, starting from first pioneering studies in the early 1990s using gamma-retroviral vectors, based on multiple infusions of genetically corrected autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. HSC represented the ideal target for gene correction to guarantee production of engineered multi-lineage progeny, but it required a decade to achieve therapeutic benefit with this approach. Introduction of low-intensity conditioning represented a crucial step in achieving stable gene-corrected HSC engraftment and therapeutic levels of ADA-expressing cells. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that gamma-retroviral GT for ADA-SCID has a favorable safety profile and is effective in restoring normal purine metabolism and immune functions in patients >13 years after treatment. No abnormal clonal proliferation or leukemia development have been observed in >40 patients treated experimentally in five different centers worldwide. In 2016, the medicinal product Strimvelis received marketing approval in Europe for patients affected by ADA-SCID without a suitable human leukocyte antigen-matched related donor. Positive safety and efficacy results have been obtained in GT clinical trials using lentiviral vectors encoding ADA. The results obtained in last 25 years in ADA-SCID GT development fundamentally contributed to improve patients' prognosis, together with earlier diagnosis thanks to newborn screening. These advances open the way to further clinical development of GT as treatment for broader applications, from inherited diseases to cancer.","['Ferrua, Francesca', 'Aiuti, Alessandro']","['Ferrua F', 'Aiuti A']","['1 San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Pediatric Immunohematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute , Milan, Italy.', '2 Vita-Salute San Raffaele University , Milan, Italy .', '1 San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Pediatric Immunohematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute , Milan, Italy.', '2 Vita-Salute San Raffaele University , Milan, Italy .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)'],IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Replacement Therapy', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/*therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ADA-SCID', '*adenosine deaminase', '*clinical trial', '*gene therapy', '*primary immunodeficiency']",2017/08/30 06:00,2018/06/01 06:00,['2017/08/30 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2017.175 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2017 Nov;28(11):972-981. doi: 10.1089/hum.2017.175.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JMML has been extensively modeled in mice expressing the oncogenic KrasG12D mutation. However, these models have struggled to recapitulate the defining features of JMML due to in utero lethality, nonhematopoietic expression, and the pervasive emergence of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we have developed a model of JMML using mice that express KrasG12D in multipotent progenitor cells (Flt3Cre+ KrasG12D mice). These mice express KrasG12D in utero, are born at normal Mendelian ratios, develop hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and succumb to a rapidly progressing and fully penetrant neonatal myeloid disease. Mutant mice have altered hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations in the BM and spleen that are hypersensitive to granulocyte macrophage-CSF due to hyperactive RAS/ERK signaling. Biased differentiation in these progenitors results in an expansion of neutrophils and DCs and a concomitant decrease in T lymphocytes. Flt3Cre+ KrasG12D fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors give rise to a myeloid disease upon transplantation. In summary, we describe a KrasG12D mouse model that reproducibly develops JMML-like disease. This model will prove useful for preclinical drug studies and for elucidating the developmental origins of pediatric neoplasms.","['Tarnawsky, Stefan P', 'Kobayashi, Michihiro', 'Chan, Rebecca J', 'Yoder, Mervin C']","['Tarnawsky SP', 'Kobayashi M', 'Chan RJ', 'Yoder MC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, and.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170828,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology']",,,2017/08/29 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/08/29 06:00'],"['2017/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['94031 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI94031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 Oct 2;127(10):3652-3656. doi: 10.1172/JCI94031.

Glucuronidation of amines has been shown to exhibit large species differences, where the activity is typically more pronounced in human than in many preclinical species such as rat, mouse, dog and monkey. The purpose of this work was to characterize the in vitro glucuronidation of GNE-924, a potent pan-PIM inhibitor, to form M1 using liver microsomes (LM) and intestinal microsomes (IM). 2. M1 formation kinetics varied highly across species and between liver and intestinal microsomes. In LM incubations, rat exhibited the highest rate of M1 formation (CLint,app) at 140 +/- 10 microL/min/mg protein, which was approximately 30-fold higher than human. In IM incubations, mouse exhibited the highest CLint,app at 484 +/- 40 microL/min/mg protein, which was >1000-fold higher than human. In addition, CLint,app in LM was markedly higher than IM in human and monkey. In contrast, CLint,app in IM was markedly higher than LM in dog and mouse. 3. Reaction phenotyping indicated that UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, UGT2B4 and the intestine-specific UGT1A10 contributed to the formation of M1. 4. This is one of the first reports showing that N-glucuronidation activity is significantly greater in multiple preclinical species than in humans, and suggests that extensive intestinal N-glucuronidation may limit the oral exposure of GNE-924.","['Lin, Molly', 'Ly, Justin', 'Takahashi, Ryan', 'Chen, John', 'Deese, Alan', 'Robinson, Sarah J', 'Kolesnikov, Aleksandr', 'Wong, Susan', 'Wang, Xiaojing', 'Chang, Jae H']","['Lin M', 'Ly J', 'Takahashi R', 'Chen J', 'Deese A', 'Robinson SJ', 'Kolesnikov A', 'Wong S', 'Wang X', 'Chang JH']","['a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech , South San Francisco , CA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170929,England,Xenobiotica,Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,1306665,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (GNE-924)', '0 (Glucuronides)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Dogs', 'Glucuronides/*metabolism', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*chemistry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Species Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['Intestinal microsomes', 'N-glucuronidation', 'UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)', 'liver microsomes', 'species differences']",2017/08/29 06:00,2018/11/14 06:00,['2017/08/29 06:00'],"['2017/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00498254.2017.1373312 [doi]'],ppublish,Xenobiotica. 2018 Oct;48(10):1021-1027. doi: 10.1080/00498254.2017.1373312.

In this study, we developed the first CD123 (AML tumor marker) aptamers and designed a novel CD123-aptamer-mediated targeted drug train (TDT) with effective, economical, biocompatible and high drug-loading capacity. These two CD123 aptamers (termed as ZW25 and CY30, respectively) can bind to a CD123 peptide epitope and CD123 + AML cells with high specificities and KD of 29.41 nM and 15.38 nM, respectively, while has minimal cross reactivities to albumin, IgG and trypsin. Further, TDT is self-assembled from two short primers by ligand-modified ZW25 that acted as initiation position for elongation, while intercalated by doxorubicin (Dox). TDT is capable of transporting high capacity of Dox to CD123 + cells and retains the efficacy of Dox, while significantly reducing drug uptake and eased toxicity to CD123- cells in vitro (p < .01). Moreover, TDT can ease Dox cytoxicity to normal tissues, prolong survivals and inhibit tumor growth of mouse xenograft tumor model in vivo. These suggest that CD123 aptamer and CD123 aptamer-mediated targeted drug delivery system may have potential applications for selective delivery cytotoxic agents to CD123-expressing tumors in AML theranostics.","['Wu, Haibin', 'Wang, Meng', 'Dai, Bo', 'Zhang, Yanmin', 'Yang, Ying', 'Li, Qiao', 'Duan, Mingyue', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Wang, Xiaomei', 'Li, Anmao', 'Zhang, Liyu']","['Wu H', 'Wang M', 'Dai B', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Li Q', 'Duan M', 'Zhang X', 'Wang X', 'Li A', 'Zhang L']","[""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""b Key laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Ministry of Education , Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""c Department of Orthopedics , The No.11 Hospital of PLA , YiNing , XinJiang , People's Republic of China."", ""d Shaanxi Center for Stem Cell Application Engineering Research , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""e Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Ischemic Cardiovascular Disease , Institute of Basic and Translational Medicine, Xi'an Medical University , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""f Clinical Laboratory , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""a Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases , Xi'an Children's Hospital , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."", ""b Key laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Ministry of Education , Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Drug Deliv,Drug delivery,9417471,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Theranostic Nanomedicine']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD123 aptamer', 'high drug loading', 'in vivo', 'self-assembly', 'targeted drug train']",2017/08/29 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2017/08/29 06:00'],"['2017/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10717544.2017.1367976 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Deliv. 2017 Nov;24(1):1216-1229. doi: 10.1080/10717544.2017.1367976.,,,,PMC8241133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only scarce data are available on sCD14 in hematological patients with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. The study aim was to investigate sCD14 as an early biomarker in febrile neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy to detect a rapidly deteriorating clinical course early enough to avoid serious infectious complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 87 adult hematological patients at the start of febrile neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia or after autologous stem cell transplantation. The study endpoints were septic shock, severe sepsis, and positive blood culture findings. sCD14 was analyzed from day 0 to day 2, and its prognostic capacity was compared to that of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. RESULTS: Plasma level of sCD14 predicted the development of septic shock on day 1 (p = 0.001) and day 2 but not the development of severe sepsis or blood culture positivity in hematological patients with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Soluble CD14 did not predict an overall complicated course at the early stages of febrile neutropenia. However, it was helpful in predicting the progression of the clinical course of neutropenic fever to septic shock.","['Korpelainen, Sini', 'Intke, Carina', 'Hamalainen, Sari', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Juutilainen, Auni', 'Pulkki, Kari']","['Korpelainen S', 'Intke C', 'Hamalainen S', 'Jantunen E', 'Juutilainen A', 'Pulkki K']","['University of Eastern Finland and Eastern Finland Laboratory Centre, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'University of Eastern Finland and Eastern Finland Laboratory Centre, Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170806,United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Calcitonin/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*blood/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Shock, Septic/*blood/etiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects']",,,2017/08/29 06:00,2018/07/07 06:00,['2017/08/29 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/9805609 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Markers. 2017;2017:9805609. doi: 10.1155/2017/9805609.

Methods: TMA system was established with TaqMan probes, specific primers, moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase, and reaction substrates. The sensitivity of TMA was evaluated by amplifying a group of 10-fold diluted HIV RNA standards which were transcribed in vitro. A total of 60 plasma of HIV infected patients were measured by TMA and Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test to observe the positive rate. The correlation and concordance of the above two technologies were investigated by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: TMA system was established successfully and HIV RNA transcribed standards at concentration of equal or more than 10 copies/mL could be detected by TMA technology. Among 60 samples of plasma from HIV infected patients, 46 were positively detected and 12 were negatively amplified by both TMA and Cobas reagents; 2 samples were positively tested by Cobas reagent but negatively tested by TMA system. The concordance rate of the two methods was 97.1% and the difference of positive detection rate between the two methods was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Linear regression was used for 46 samples which were positively detected by both TMA and Cobas reagents and showed an excellent correlation between the two reagents (r=0.997, P<0.001). Bland-Altma analysis revealed that the mean different value of HIV RNA levels for denary logarithm was 0.02. Forty-four samples were included in 95% of credibility interval of concordance. Conclusion: TMA system has the potential of high sensitivity. TMA and real-time RT-PCR keep an excellent correlation and consistency in detecting HIV RNA.","['Wu, Daxian', 'Tao, Shuhui', 'Liu, Shuiping', 'Zhou, Jiebin', 'Tan, Deming', 'Hou, Zhouhua']","['Wu D', 'Tao S', 'Liu S', 'Zhou J', 'Tan D', 'Hou Z']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis of Hunan Province, Changsha 410008; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis of Hunan Province, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis of Hunan Province, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis of Hunan Province, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis of Hunan Province, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

We hypothesized that FO is associated with transplantation outcomes and evaluated this complication in 2 cohorts of patients. FO was graded based on post-transplantation weight gain, symptoms, and need for treatment, scored in real time by an independent team. The first cohort (study cohort; n = 145) underwent haploidentical transplantation for hematologic malignancies following a melphalan-based conditioning regimen. In univariate analysis, factors associated with day +100 nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were FO grade >/=2 (hazard ratio [HR], 15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2 to 55; P < .001), creatinine >1 mg/dL (HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6 to 14; P = .005), and age >55 years (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 13; P = .008). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with day +100 NRM were FO grade >/=2 (HR, 13.1; 95% CI, 3.4 to 50; P < .001) and serum creatinine level >1 mg/dL at transplantation admission (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 11; P = .03). These findings were verified in a separate cohort (validation cohort) of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent HLA-matched transplantation with busulfan-based conditioning (n = 449). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with day +100 NRM were FO grade >/=2 (HR, 34; 95% CI, 7.2 to 158; P < .001) and, in patients with FO grade <2, advanced disease status (HR, 5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 22; P = .03).

We examined the expansion of circulating monocytic (M-) MDSCs and granulocytic (G-) MDSCs at the time of engraftment in 130 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT). Compared with the G-MDSC group, the high M-MDSC group had a higher infection rate within 100 days, along with worse 1-year cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) and 2-year probability of event-free survival (EFS). The frequency of M-MDSCs was associated with preceding severe mucositis. Transcriptome profiling analysis of 2 isolated MDSC subtype showed significantly greater matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in M-MDSCs than in G-MDSCs. M-MDSCs produced abundantly more MMP-9. Importantly, compared with G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs isolated from patients post-HSCT had a greater capacity to suppress T cell responses, and MMP-9 blockade more forcefully inhibited their immunosuppressive effect. MMP-9 levels also were associated with the occurrence of infections and with transplantation outcomes. Based on these findings, we identify M-MDSCs as a major contributor to infections early after allo-HSCT and worse clinical outcomes via MMP-9.","['Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Lim, Ji-Young', 'Kim, Tae Woo', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Lee, Seok', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Shin, Dong-Mi', 'Choi, Eun Young', 'Min, Chang-Ki']","['Lee SE', 'Lim JY', 'Kim TW', 'Jeon YW', 'Yoon JH', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee S', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Shin DM', 'Choi EY', 'Min CK']","[""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'College of Human Ecology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

We recently showed that CML LSCs depend on Tcf1 and Lef1 factors for self-renewal. Using a connectivity map, we identified prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) as a small molecule that partly elicited the gene expression changes in LSCs caused by Tcf1/Lef1 deficiency. Although it has little impact on normal hematopoiesis, we found that PGE1 treatment impaired the persistence and activity of LSCs in a pre-clinical murine CML model and a xenograft model of transplanted CML patient CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PGE1 acted on the EP4 receptor and repressed Fosb and Fos AP-1 factors in a beta-catenin-independent manner. Misoprostol, an FDA-approved EP4 agonist, conferred similar protection against CML. These findings suggest that activation of this PGE1-EP4 pathway specifically targets CML LSCs and that the combination of PGE1/misoprostol with conventional tyrosine-kinase inhibitors could provide effective therapy for CML.","['Li, Fengyin', 'He, Bing', 'Ma, Xiaoke', 'Yu, Shuyang', 'Bhave, Rupali R', 'Lentz, Steven R', 'Tan, Kai', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Xue, Hai-Hui']","['Li F', 'He B', 'Ma X', 'Yu S', 'Bhave RR', 'Lentz SR', 'Tan K', 'Guzman ML', 'Zhao C', 'Xue HH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."", ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."", 'State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, P.R.

Guadecitabine, a next-generation hypomethylating drug, has a longer half-life and exposure than its active metabolite decitabine. A phase 1 study established 60 mg/m(2) guadecitabine for 5 days as an effective treatment schedule. In this phase 2 study, we aimed to assess the safety and activity of two doses and schedules of guadecitabine in older (>/=65 years) patients with treatment-naive acute myeloid leukaemia who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 1/2 study of guadecitabine in cohorts of patients with treatment-naive acute myeloid leukaemia, relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes; here we report the phase 2 results from the cohort of treatment-naive patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. We included patients aged at least 65 years from 14 US medical centres (hospitals and specialist cancer clinics) who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy and randomly assigned them (1:1) using a computer algorithm (for dynamic randomisation) to guadecitabine 60 or 90 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 (5-day schedule) of a 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment allocation was not masked. We also assigned additional patients to guadecitabine 60 mg/m(2) in a 10-day schedule in a 28-day treatment cycle after a protocol amendment. The primary endpoint was composite complete response (complete response, complete response with incomplete platelet recovery, or complete response with incomplete neutrophil recovery regardless of platelets). Response was assessed in all patients (as-treated) who received at least one dose of guadecitabine. We present the final analysis, although at the time of the database lock, 15 patients were still in follow-up for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01261312. FINDINGS: Between Aug 24, 2012, and Sept 15, 2014, 107 patients were enrolled: 54 on the 5-day schedule (26 randomly assigned to 60 mg/m(2) and 28 to 90 mg/m(2)) and 53 were assigned to the 10-day schedule. Median age was 77 years (range 62-92), and median follow-up was 953 days (IQR 721-1040). All treated patients were assessable for a response. The number of patients who achieved a composite complete response did not differ between dose groups or schedules (13 [54%, 95% CI 32.8-74.4] with 60 mg/m(2) on the 5-day schedule; 16 [59%; 38.8-77.6] with 90 mg/m(2) on the 5-day schedule; and 26 [50%, 35.8-64.2] with 60 mg/m(2) on the 10-day schedule). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events, regardless of relationship to treatment, were febrile neutropenia (31 [61%] of 51 patients on the 5-day schedule vs 36 [69%] of 52 patients on the 10-day schedule), thrombocytopenia (25 [49%] vs 22 [42%]), neutropenia (20 [39%] vs 18 [35%]), pneumonia (15 [29%] vs 19 [37%]), anaemia (15 [29%] vs 12 [23%]), and sepsis (eight [16%] vs 14 [27%]). The most common serious adverse events, regardless of relationship to treatment, for the 5-day and 10-day schedules, respectively, were febrile neutropenia (27 [53%] vs 25 [48%]), pneumonia (14 [27%] vs 16 [31%]), and sepsis (eight [16%] vs 14 [27%]). 23 (22%) patients died because of adverse events (mainly from sepsis, eight [8%]; and pneumonia, five [5%]); four deaths were from adverse events deemed treatment-related (pneumonia, two [2%]; multiorgan failure, one [1%]; and sepsis, one [1%], all in the 10-day cohort). INTERPRETATION: More than half of older treatment-naive patients with acute myeloid leukaemia achieved a composite complete response with guadecitabine at all drug doses and schedules investigated, with tolerable toxicity. The recommended guadecitabine regimen for this population is 60 mg/m(2) in a 5-day schedule. A phase 3 study in this patient population is ongoing (NCT02348489) to assess guadecitabine 60 mg/m(2) in a 5-day schedule versus standard of care.

Most data in hematological malignancies (HMs) refers to total OPN (tOPN), comprehending the sum of distinct OPN splicing isoforms (OPN-SI), while reports describing the expression and roles of each OPN-SI are scarce. This review aims to summarize tOPN roles in HMs and provide evidence that OPN-SIs can also modulate specific functions in HMs biology. We summarize that upregulated tOPN can modulate HMs (leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma) progression, inducing cell adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis, cell differentiation and extramedullary and/or central nervous system infiltration. Based on this expression pattern, tOPN has been pointed out as a biomarker in those HMs, thus providing potential targets for therapeutic approaches. Our group found that OPN-SIs are expressed in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cell lines (unpublished data), providing early evidence that OPN-SIs are also expressed in BCP-ALL. Further studies should investigate whether these OPN-SIs can differently modulate HMs biology and their putative application as auxiliary biomarkers for HMs.","['Bastos, Ana Clara Santos Fonseca', 'Blunck, Caroline Barbieri', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Gimba, Etel Rodrigues Pereira']","['Bastos ACSF', 'Blunck CB', 'Emerenciano M', 'Gimba ERP']","['Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Coordenacao de Pesquisa, Programa de Oncobiologia Celular e Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Coordenacao de Pesquisa, Programa de Hematologia-Oncologia Pediatrico, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Coordenacao de Pesquisa, Programa de Hematologia-Oncologia Pediatrico, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Coordenacao de Pesquisa, Programa de Oncobiologia Celular e Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Universidade Federal Fluminense, Instituto de Humanidades e Saude (IHS), Departamento de Ciencias da Natureza (RCN), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

However, evidence of its efficacy and safety in Middle Eastern clinical settings is scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The efficacy and safety of generic imatinib (Cemivil) were assessed among Jordanian patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia using an observational, multicenter, prospective study design. Responses were defined using European LeukemiaNet 2009 guidelines and assessed by complete blood counts, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All patients (N = 91) were adults with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with generic imatinib 400 mg/day. Thirty-three patients received generic imatinib as first-line therapy, and 58 switched from patented imatinib to generic imatinib after a median of 4.5 years (range, 0.5-13.6 years) of imatinib therapy. The majority (85%; n = 28) of the first-line patients achieved complete hematologic response within 3 months of starting generic imatinib therapy (100% after 6 months [n = 33]). The 12-month major molecular response rate in the intention-to-treat population was 45%. The 12-month major molecular response rate was 88% for patients who switched therapy. The 12-month progression-free and overall survival rates were 92% and 100%, respectively. Most (85%; n = 144) adverse events were mild. Frequencies of drug-related adverse events were similar to patented imatinib. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the efficacy and safety of generic imatinib in this Middle Eastern population in routine clinical practice are comparable to patented imatinib, and to that of the global population.","['Awidi, Abdalla', 'Abbasi, Salah', 'Alrabi, Kamal', 'Kheirallah, Khalid A']","['Awidi A', 'Abbasi S', 'Alrabi K', 'Kheirallah KA']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jordan, Al-Jubeiha, Amman, Jordan.

The interindividual genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymes and DNA repair genes influence the efficacy and toxicity of numerous chemotherapeutic drugs affecting the treatment outcome. AIM OF THE WORK: The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of drug metabolizing CYP1, GSTP1 and DNA repair (XRCC1) genes polymorphisms on the toxicity and response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODOLOGY: Ninety seven ALL pediatric patients were genotyped for CYP1A1, GSTP1 ILe105Val and XRCC1 Arg194Tryp single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the wild and variant (homozygous and heterozygous) genotypes of the polymorphisms studied in CYP1A1, GSTP1 or XRCC1 genes regarding age, total leukocyte count, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic or risk group. The SNPs in CYP1A1, GSTP1 and XRCC1 genes did not show significant association with complete remission (CR) rate, overall survival (OS) or event free survival (EFS). However, XRCC1 Arg194Trp SNP was associated with higher drug toxicity; carriers of variant genotypes (CT and TT) had a significantly higher frequency of myelosuppression compared to those with the wild CC genotype (21/43[48.8%]) compared to (14/54[25.9%]) (p=0.020). The analysis of the combined effect of studied SNPs did not show any significant association with patient outcome. CONCLUSION: Our study reported a significant association between the DNA repair gene polymorphism and myelosuppression in childhood ALL patients. Adjustment of the dose of chemotherapeutic agents according to XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism may improve outcome in cases with risk of toxicity.","['Abo-Bakr, Asmaa', 'Mossallam, Ghada', 'El Azhary, Nevin', 'Hafez, Hanafy', 'Badawy, Ragia']","['Abo-Bakr A', 'Mossallam G', 'El Azhary N', 'Hafez H', 'Badawy R']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.

Treatment is costly, often involving admission to the intensive care unit and prolonged hospitalization. We evaluated outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and sepsis in Texas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of adults discharged from Texas hospitals during 2011, using ICD-9-CM codes and the Texas Inpatient Data Collection. RESULTS: A total of 2,173,776 adults were discharged from hospitals in Texas, and 5501 (0.25%) had a diagnosis of AML. Among patients with AML, 40% were >/= 65 years old, and 52% were men. The rate of sepsis for AML patients was 16% compared to 4% for non-AML patients. Among patients with AML, sepsis was associated with pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hematologic dysfunctions in 34%, 32%, and 29% of discharges, respectively. Median length of stay, intensive care unit admission rate, and median hospital charges per stay for patients with AML and sepsis were 13 days (range, 1-133 days), 72%, and $122,333, respectively. Among in-hospital deaths due to sepsis, mortality was 30% in AML patients compared to 21% in non-AML patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with AML had a higher sepsis incidence and higher mortality rates overall, especially in relation to stem-cell transplant recipients and those with other types of cancer. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether early intervention or treatment in specialized centers could improve outcomes and reduce costs of care, particularly in the management of serious complications such as sepsis.","['Malik, Imrana A', 'Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Gaeta, Susan', 'Borthakur, Gautum', 'Price, Kristen', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Nates, Joseph L']","['Malik IA', 'Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Gaeta S', 'Borthakur G', 'Price K', 'Cortes J', 'Nates JL']","['Department of Critical Care, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

RECENT FINDINGS: Somatic mutations are common in MDS and are associated with disease features including outcomes. Several recurrently mutated genes have prognostic significance independent of risk stratification tools used in practice. However, this prognostic impact can depend on the clinicogenetic context in which mutations occur. Qualitatively, SF3B1 mutations appear favorable only in patients with < 5% bone marrow blasts while mutations of several genes, including ASXL1, SRSF2, U2AF1, NRAS, and IDH2, appear adverse in this context. Mutations of TP53, RUNX1, and EZH2 appear adverse regardless of blast percentage. Consensus on how to best incorporate mutations into risk assessment is still being developed. Somatic mutations can refine risk stratification and improve the accuracy of existing prognostic models, often upstaging or downstaging patients across the boundary of higher- and lower-risk MDS.","['Nazha, Aziz', 'Bejar, Rafael']","['Nazha A', 'Bejar R']","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, 3855 Health Sciences Drive MC 0820, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0820, USA. rabejar@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Humans', '*Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Genetic testing', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*Prognosis', '*Somatic mutations']",2017/08/28 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2017/08/28 06:00'],"['2017/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0407-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0407-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Oct;12(5):461-467. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0407-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we developed a 96-wells microplate-based method able to determine NADPH oxidase activity. Using this method, we determined pharmacological properties of the NADPH oxidase inhibitors VAS2870 and diphenyleneiodonium and the obtained IC50 values were in good agreement with previous reported data. NOX2 is highly expressed in differentiated promyelocytic leukaemia cells, whereas other isoforms are not detected or expressed at low amounts. Likewise, this methodology may be a useful assay for NOX2 inhibitor screening. NADPH oxidases are involved in several physiological and pathological processes, rendering its pharmacological modulation an attractive research target. In this context, this simple assay can be used for NADPH oxidase inhibitor screening as well as aiding in the study of different biological conditions that involve NADPH oxidase activity.","['Cortes-Rios, J', 'Torres, M J', 'Campos-Bustamante, M P', 'Romero-Parra, J', 'Letelier, M E', 'Pessoa-Mahana, D', 'Chung, H', 'Faundez, M']","['Cortes-Rios J', 'Torres MJ', 'Campos-Bustamante MP', 'Romero-Parra J', 'Letelier ME', 'Pessoa-Mahana D', 'Chung H', 'Faundez M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile; Department of Pharmacological and Toxicological Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile.', 'Department of Pharmacological and Toxicological Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile.

Nowadays the survival rate is around 85%. Nevertheless, an urgent clinical need is still represented by primary refractory and relapsed patients who do not significantly benefit from standard approaches, including chemo-radiotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). For this reason, immunotherapy has so far represented a challenging novel treatment opportunity, including, as the most validated therapeutic options, cancer vaccines, donor-lymphocyte infusions and tumor-specific immune effector cells. More recently, unexpected positive clinical results in ALL have been achieved by application of gene-engineered chimeric antigen expressing (CAR) T cells. Several CAR designs across different trials have generated similar response rates, with Complete Response (CR) of 60-90% at 1 month and an Event-Free Survival (EFS) of 70% at 6 months. Relevant challenges anyway remain to be addressed, such as amelioration of technical, cost and feasibility aspects of cell and gene manipulation and the necessity to face the occurrence of relapse mechanisms. This review describes the state of the art of ALL immunotherapies, the novelties in terms of gene manipulation approaches and the problems emerged from early clinical studies. We describe and discuss the process of clinical translation, including the design of a cell manufacturing protocol, vector production and regulatory issues. Multiple antigen targeting and combination of CAR T cells with molecular targeted drugs have also been evaluated as latest strategies to prevail over immune-evasion.","['Biondi, Andrea', 'Magnani, Chiara F', 'Tettamanti, Sarah', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Biagi, Ettore']","['Biondi A', 'Magnani CF', 'Tettamanti S', 'Gaipa G', 'Biagi E']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Osp.

Recently, inhibition of p97 was shown to induce ER stress and subsequently cell death in solid tumors and in multiple myeloma. We investigated the role of a novel, orally available, p97 inhibitor (CB-5083; Cleave Biosciences) in B-ALL. CB-5083 induced a significant reduction in viability in 10 human B-ALL cell lines, harboring the most common fusion-genes involved in pediatric and adult B-ALL, with IC50s ranging from 0.34 to 0.76 muM. Moreover, CB-5083 significantly reduced the colony formation of OP1 and NALM6 cells. Early and strong induction of apoptosis was demonstrated in BALL1 and OP1 cells, together with a robust cleavage of PARP. CB-5083 induced ER stress, as documented through: 1) prominent expression of chaperones (GRP78, GRP94, PDI, DNAJC3, and DNAJB9); 2) increased activation of IRE1-alpha, as demonstrated by the splicing of XBP1; and 3) activation of PERK, which resulted in a significant overexpression of CHOP, and its downstream genes. CB-5083 reduced the viability also in GRP78(-/-), GRP94(-/-), and XBP1(-/-) cells, suggesting that none of these proteins alone was strictly required for CB-5083 activity. Moreover, we showed that the absence of XBP1 (XBP1(-/-)) increased the sensitivity to CB-5083, leading to the hypothesis that XBP1 splicing counteracts the activity of CB-5083, probably mitigating ER stress. Finally, vincristine was synergistic with CB-5083 in both BALL1 and OP1 cells. In summary, the targeting of p97 with CB-5083 is a novel promising therapeutic approach that should be further evaluated in B-ALL.","['Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Sudo, Makoto', 'Cao, Qi', 'Lin, De-Chen', 'Sun, Haibo', 'Takao, Sumiko', 'Le Moigne, Ronan', 'Rolfe, Mark', 'Gery, Sigal', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Gugliotta G', 'Sudo M', 'Cao Q', 'Lin DC', 'Sun H', 'Takao S', 'Le Moigne R', 'Rolfe M', 'Gery S', 'Muschen M', 'Cavo M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Institute of Hematology ""L. & A.

PD-1/PD-L1 and Tim-3/Gal-9 axes are two major pathways in this area which their contribution has been documented in a variety of malignancies. In this study, Gal-9 and PD-L1 expression was investigated in leukemic cells from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 25 untreated CLL patients and 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. CLL patients were classified into different clinical stages based on the Rai staging system. Total RNA was extracted from all samples and applied for cDNA synthesis. Relative expression of Gal-9 and PD-L1 mRNA was determined by Real-Time PCR using beta-actin as a housekeeping gene. Results: Gal-9 and PD-L1 mRNA was significantly more expressed in CLL patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001 and p=0.005, respectively). CLL patients in advanced clinical stages showed higher expression of Gal-9 and PD-L1 in comparison to patients in early clinical stages (p<0.0001 and p=0.004, respectively). Conclusion: Our promising results regarding over-expression of Gal-9 and PD-L1 in CLL patients call future complementary studies to more evaluate and confirm these pathways for immunotherapy approaches of this malignancy. Upregulation of both Gal-9 and PD-L1 in CLL patients with advanced clinical stages introduces them as useful prognostic biomarkers for disease progression.","['Taghiloo, Saeid', 'Allahmoradi, Esmaeil', 'Ebadi, Reza', 'Tehrani, Mohsen', 'Hosseini-Khah, Zahra', 'Janbabaei, Ghasem', 'Shekarriz, Ramin', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein']","['Taghiloo S', 'Allahmoradi E', 'Ebadi R', 'Tehrani M', 'Hosseini-Khah Z', 'Janbabaei G', 'Shekarriz R', 'Asgarian-Omran H']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.

About 20% of patients with CML do not respond to treatment with Imatinib either initially or because of acquired resistance. In addition to mutated BCR-ABL1 kinase, the organic cation transporter1 (OCT1, encoded by SLC22A1) has been considered to contribute to Imatinib resistance in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). OCT1 has been reported to be the main influx transporter involved in Imatinib uptake into CML cells. To date, only a few studies have been reported on involvement of influx transporters in development of Imatinib resistance. Therefore this study was aimed to determine the expression level of Imatinib uptake transporter (OCT1) in CML patients and to correlate this level with molecular response. Methods: One hundred fifty eight patients on Imatinib were considered for gene expression analysis study for OCT1 gene. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were synthesized and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RQ-PCR) was performed. Results: High OCT1 expression was present in 81 (51.8%) patients and low OCT1 expression was in 77 (48.7%) patients. Low Sokal risk score group have a significantly high OCT1 expression (p=0.048). The rate of molecular response was higher in those with high OCT1 expression than in those with low OCT1 expression (p=0.05). Both event-free survival and median overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with low OCT1 expressions when compared to the patients with high OCT1 expression (p=0.03 and p=0.05). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that the mRNA expression level of OCT1 was significantly correlated with molecular response in CML patients. Based on these findings, present study believes that the pre-therapeutic higher expression of OCT1 may help to predict response to imatinib therapy in CML patients.","['Chhikara, S', 'Sazawal, S', 'Seth, T', 'Chaubey, R', 'Singh, K', 'Sharma, R', 'Mishra, P', 'Mahapatra, M', 'Saxena, R']","['Chhikara S', 'Sazawal S', 'Seth T', 'Chaubey R', 'Singh K', 'Sharma R', 'Mishra P', 'Mahapatra M', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.

This study aimed to investigate the role of Bcl-2 in controlling the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis during hydroquinone (HQ)-induced TK6 cytotoxicity. In this study, HQ, one metabolite of benzene, decreased the MMP in a concentration-dependent manner and induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of the DNA damage marker gamma-H2AX, and production of the DNA damage-responsive enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Exposure of TK6 cells to HQ leads to an increase in Bcl-2 and co-localization with PARP-1 in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of Bcl-2 using the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737, suppressed the PARP-1 nuclear to cytoplasm translocation and sensitized TK6 cells to HQ-induced apoptosis through depolarization of the MMP. Western blot analysis indicated that ABT-737 combined with HQ increased the levels of cleaved PARP and gamma-H2AX, but significantly decreased the level of P53. Thus, ABT-737 can influence PARP-1 translocation and induce apoptosis via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, independently of P53. In addition, we found that knockdown of PARP-1 attenuated the HQ-induced production of cleaved PARP and P53. These results identify Bcl-2 as a protective mediator of HQ-induced apoptosis and show that upregulation of Bcl-2 helps to localize PARP-1 to the cytoplasm and stabilize MMP. Environ. Mol.

Imatinib mesylate (IM) is the first line of therapy for treatment of CML and results in remission in most cases. However, a significant percentage of patients develop chemoresistance to IM, which might be due to the presence of chemoresistant cells in the bone marrow. In the current study, we explored the role of cell-cell interaction of CML cells with the bone marrow stromal cells in the development of chemoresistance in CML. We found that the stromal cells offered long-term chemoprotection to the CML cells from the apoptotic effect of IM. These stroma interacting CML cells were maintained in a non-proliferative stage and had increased ERK1/2 and SMAD1/8 phosphorylation levels. Prolonged interaction of CML cells with the stromal cells in the presence of IM resulted in the acquisition of stroma-free chemoresistance to IM treatment. However, inhibition of actin cytoskeleton, ERK1/2 and SMAD signaling abrogated the chemoresistance acquisition and sensitized the chemoresistant CML cells to IM induced apoptosis.","['Kumar, Atul', 'Bhattacharyya, Jina', 'Jaganathan, Bithiah Grace']","['Kumar A', 'Bhattacharyya J', 'Jaganathan BG']","['Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Assam, 781039, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Gauhati Medical College, Assam, India.', 'Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Assam, 781039, India. bithiahgj@iitg.ernet.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170825,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2017/08/27 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2017/08/27 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-10373-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-10373-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Aug 25;7(1):9535. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-10373-3.,,,,PMC5572702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the results, HDAraC in a dosage of 3 g/m(2) twice daily significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared with IDAraC [hazard rate (HR) 0.87, 95% CrI 0.79-0.97) and LDAraC (HR 0.86, 95% CrI 0.78-0.95). Subgroup analysis further showed that the DFS advantage of HDAraC is focused on the patients with favorable cytogenetics, but not the other cytogenetics. Compared with LDAraC, HDAraC (HR 6.04, 95% CrI 1.67-21.49) and IDAraC (HR 3.80, 95% CrI 1.05-12.85) were associated with higher risk of grade 3-4 non-haematological toxicity. However, no significant difference between HDAraC and IDAraC was found. These findings suggest that Ara-C in a dosage of 3 g/m(2) twice daily provides maximal anti-relapse effect.","['Wu, Di', 'Duan, Chongyang', 'Chen, Liyong', 'Chen, Size']","['Wu D', 'Duan C', 'Chen L', 'Chen S']","['Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Medical Molecular Diagnostics, China-America Cancer Research Institute, Dongguan Scientific Research Center, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Medical Molecular Diagnostics, China-America Cancer Research Institute, Dongguan Scientific Research Center, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, China. chenliyong09@163.com.', 'Central Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutics University, Guangzhou, 510405, China. chensize@139.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170825,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase IV as Topic', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/08/27 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2017/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-10368-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-10368-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Aug 25;7(1):9509. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-10368-0.,,,,PMC5572788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the factors related to blastic transformation in a Mexican population treated at a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of patients with a diagnosis of CMML from 2000 to 2015 were reviewed. A total of 54 patients were included, with a median age of 71 years and an overall survival of 16 months. The patients with incomplete data were excluded. IBM SPSS Statistics, version 21.0, software was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The rate of blastic transformation was 33% (18 patients), and the interval time to progression was 9 months (range, 0-87 months). Comparing the patients who did not undergo blastic transformation to those who did, those with progression to acute leukemia tended to be younger (age, 58 vs. 71 years; P = .001), to have a greater peripheral blood blast count (>/= 2% vs. 0%; P = .003), and were more likely to have immature myeloid precursors circulating in the peripheral blood (94% vs. 64%; P = .02). On multivariate analysis, younger age continued to be a statistically significant factor for progression (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.929-0.987). CONCLUSION: Mexican patients with CMML that progressed to overt acute leukemia were considerably younger, with a higher tumor burden and short overall survival. In this population, it is important to consider more aggressive treatment at diagnosis, focusing on high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within a short period.","['Rivera Duarte, Alfonso', 'Armengol Alonso, Alejandra', 'Sandoval Cartagena, Elena', 'Tuna Aguilar, Elena']","['Rivera Duarte A', 'Armengol Alonso A', 'Sandoval Cartagena E', 'Tuna Aguilar E']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.

The clinical benefit of intensification of the daunorubicin dose to 90 mg/m(2) has been supported by randomized trials. Based on these promising results, in 2010 we changed our induction protocol of acute myeloid leukemia, increasing the dose of daunorubicin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the treatment outcome of patients treated with high-dose daunorubicin (90 mg/m(2) on days 1-3) and cytosine arabinoside (200 mg/m(2)/day continuous infusion on days 1-7) compared with patients receiving 45 to 60 mg/m(2) of daunorubicin. Twenty-six previously untreated patients younger than 60 years of age were included. Twelve received high-dose daunorubicin (HD) and 14 the low-dose (LD). Seventeen patients were in complete remission after 1 induction cycle. RESULTS: There was no overall difference in complete remission rate between HD and LD (66% vs. 64%; P = 1.0). Thirty-day induction mortality was 15.3% overall, with a nonsignificant difference between groups (25% vs. 7.1%; P = .3). Relapses were observed in 9 (53%) patients: 3 (37.5%) in the HD group and in 6 (66.6%) in the LD group (P = .34). Invasive fungal disease (41.6% vs. 0%; P = .012), creatinine elevation (P = .001), abdominal pain (33% vs. 0%; P = .033), and need for intensive care unit admission (33.3% vs. 0%; P = .033) were more frequent in the HD group. Four patients in the HD group developed neutropenic enterocolitis (P = .033). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that 90 mg/m(2) of daunorubicin increased the toxicity compared with lower doses.","['Portugal, Rodrigo', 'Lyrio, Renata', 'Loureiro, Monique', 'Urago, Katia', 'Bard, Johny', 'Borchardt, Aline', 'Garnica, Marcia', 'Nucci, Marcio']","['Portugal R', 'Lyrio R', 'Loureiro M', 'Urago K', 'Bard J', 'Borchardt A', 'Garnica M', 'Nucci M']","['Hematology Service, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Its prevalence is approximately 12% in children, 21% in adolescents (16-20 years of age), and 20% to 24% in adults older than 40 years, with a peak (27%) in young adults 21 to 39 years old. It occurs more often in male individuals and patients with Down syndrome. Ph-like ALL is overrepresented in those with Hispanic ethnicity and is associated with inherited genetic variants in GATA3 (rs3824662). It is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous subtype of B-ALL. Although most patients with Ph-like ALL have positive minimal residual disease after remission induction and poor event-free survival, approximately 40% of pediatric patients responded well to chemotherapy and can be cured with relatively low intensity of treatment. The treatment outcome correlated negatively with increasing age at presentation. Ph-like ALL is characterized by a wide range of genetic alterations that dysregulate several cytokine receptor and kinase signaling pathways, including CRLF2 rearrangement in half of the cases and translocation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (predominantly ABL-class and Janus kinases). Patients with ABL-class fusions respond clinically to ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, whereas mutations activating the JAK-STAT pathway are amendable to treatment with JAK inhibitors in vitro or in preclinical models. Prospective studies are needed to determine if incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting kinase alterations into intensive chemotherapy regimens will improve outcome of patients with Ph-like ALL.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Pui CH', 'Roberts KG', 'Yang JJ', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.

However, patients are typically treated with the same types of chemotherapy, despite biological differences that lead to differential responses to treatment. RESULTS: Here we present a multi-lineage multi-compartment model of the hematopoietic system that captures patient-to-patient variation in both the concentration and rates of change of hematopoietic cell populations. By constraining the model against clinical hematopoietic cell recovery data derived from patients who have received induction chemotherapy, we identified trends for parameters that must be met by the model; for example, the mitosis rates and the probability of self-renewal of progenitor cells are inversely related. Within the data-consistent models, we found 22,796 parameter sets that meet chemotherapy response criteria. Simulations of these parameter sets display diverse dynamics in the cell populations. To identify large trends in these model outputs, we clustered the simulated cell population dynamics using k-means clustering and identified thirteen 'representative patient' dynamics. In each of these patient clusters, we simulated AML and found that clusters with the greatest mitotic capacity experience clinical cancer outcomes more likely to lead to shorter survival times. Conversely, other parameters, including lower death rates or mobilization rates, did not correlate with survival times. CONCLUSIONS: Using the multi-lineage model of hematopoiesis, we have identified several key features that determine leukocyte homeostasis, including self-renewal probabilities and mitosis rates, but not mobilization rates. Other influential parameters that regulate AML model behavior are responses to cytokines/growth factors produced in peripheral blood that target the probability of self-renewal of neutrophil progenitors. Finally, our model predicts that the mitosis rate of cancer is the most predictive parameter for survival time, followed closely by parameters that affect the self-renewal of cancer stem cells; most current therapies target mitosis rate, but based on our results, we propose that additional therapeutic targeting of self-renewal of cancer stem cells will lead to even higher survival rates.","['Sarker, Joyatee M', 'Pearce, Serena M', 'Nelson, Robert P Jr', 'Kinzer-Ursem, Tamara L', 'Umulis, David M', 'Rundell, Ann E']","['Sarker JM', 'Pearce SM', 'Nelson RP Jr', 'Kinzer-Ursem TL', 'Umulis DM', 'Rundell AE']","['Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, 206 S.

Incidence rates vary between ethnic groups, and recent advances in data linkage allow for a more accurate estimation of these variations. Identifying such differences may help identify potential risk or protective factors for certain childhood cancers. This study thus aims to ascertain whether such differences do indeed exist using nationwide data across seven years, as have previously been described in adult cancers. METHODS: We obtained data for all cancer registrations for children (aged 0-14) in England from January 2001 to December 2007. Ethnicity (self-assigned) was established through record linkage to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database or cancer registry data. Cancers were classified morphologically according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer into four groups - leukaemias; lymphomas; central nervous system; and other solid tumours. Age standardised incidence rates were estimated for each ethnic group, as well as incidence rate ratios comparing each individual ethnic group (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African, Black Carribean, Chinese) to Whites, adjusting for sex, age and deprivation. RESULTS: The majority of children in the study are UK born. Black children (RR = 1.18, 99% CI: 1.01-1.39), and amongst South Asians, Pakistani children (RR = 1.19, 99% CI: 1.02-1.39) appear to have an increased risk of all cancers. There is an increased risk of leukaemia in South Asians (RR = 1.31, 99% CI: 1.08-1.58), and of lymphoma in Black (RR = 1.72, 99% CI: 1.13-2.63) and South Asian children (RR = 1.51, 99% CI: 1.10-2.06). South Asians appear to have a decreased risk of CNS cancers (RR = 0.71, 99% CI: 0.54-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: In the tradition of past migrant studies, such descriptive studies within ethnic minority groups permit a better understanding of disease incidence within the population, but also allow for the generation of hypotheses to begin to understand why such differences might exist. Though a major cause of mortality in this age group, childhood cancer remains a relatively rare disease; however, the methods used here have permitted the first nationwide estimation of childhood cancer by individual ethnic group.","['Sayeed, Shameq', 'Barnes, Isobel', 'Ali, Raghib']","['Sayeed S', 'Barnes I', 'Ali R']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK. raghib.ali@ndm.ox.ac.uk.', 'Public Health Research Center, New York University Abu Dhabi , Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. raghib.ali@ndm.ox.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170825,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Sex Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer incidence', 'England', 'Ethnic minorities']",2017/08/27 06:00,2018/05/12 06:00,['2017/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3551-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3551-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Aug 25;17(1):570. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3551-7.,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8225-4674'],PMC5574126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, available information about pathogenesis and incidence of thrombosis in acute leukemia is limited. This review focuses on mechanisms underlying thrombosis in acute leukemia and discusses recent literature data. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last few years, proofs have been provided that leukemic cells release free prothrombotic products, such as micro-vesicles, tissue factors, circulating free DNA and RNA. Furthermore, leukemic blasts can activate the procoagulant population of platelets, which initiate and amplify coagulation, causing thrombosis. In addition to factors produced by acute leukemia itself, others concur to trigger thrombosis. Some drugs, infections and insertion of central venous catheter have been described to increase risk of thrombosis in patients with acute leukemia. SUMMARY: Thrombosis represents a serious complication in patients affected by myeloid and lymphoid acute leukemia. A proper knowledge of its pathophysiology and of the predisposing risk factors may allow to implement strategies of prevention. Improving prevention of thrombosis appears a major goal in patients whose frequent conditions of thrombocytopenia impede an adequate delivery of anticoagulant therapy.","['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Del Principe, Domenico', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Del Principe MI', 'Del Principe D', 'Venditti A']","[""aHematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome 'Tor Vergata' bLaboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, Institute of Translational Pharmacology, Department of Biomedicine, National Research Council (CNR), Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/pathology', 'Thrombosis/*pathology']",,,2017/08/26 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000402 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2017 Nov;29(6):448-454. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of lncRNAs is a newly established field, due in part to their capability to act as the novel biomarkers in disease. A growing body of research shows that lncRNAs may not only useful as biomarkers for the diagnosis and clinical typing and prognosis of cancers, but also as potential targets for novel therapies. Differential expression of lncRNAs has been found in leukemia in the last two years, however, the majority of the lncRNAs described here are transcripts of unknown function and their role in leukemogenesis is still unclear. Here, we summarize the lncRNAs associated with leukemia in order to find a potential classification tool for leukemia, and a new field of research is being explored.","['Chen, Shaoyun', 'Liang, Hairong', 'Yang, Hui', 'Zhou, Kairu', 'Xu, Longmei', 'Liu, Jiaxian', 'Lai, Bei', 'Song, Li', 'Luo, Hao', 'Peng, Jianming', 'Liu, Zhidong', 'Xiao, Yongmei', 'Chen, Wen', 'Tang, Huanwen']","['Chen S', 'Liang H', 'Yang H', 'Zhou K', 'Xu L', 'Liu J', 'Lai B', 'Song L', 'Luo H', 'Peng J', 'Liu Z', 'Xiao Y', 'Chen W', 'Tang H']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, China.

Pracinostat is reported to have modest clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Given the higher preclinical sensitivity of hematologic malignancies to pracinostat, the authors conducted a phase 1 study to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of pracinostat in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. METHODS: Pracinostat was administered orally 3 times a week for 3 weeks on a 28-day cycle. Patients were assigned to 7 dose levels using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were enrolled, 25 of whom had AML and 14 of whom had myelodysplastic syndrome. The maximum tolerated dose was 120 mg and the recommended phase 2 dose was 60 mg. Two patients with AML achieved a response: 1 complete remission (CR) and 1 complete cytogenetic response. Despite a dose-dependent increase in the plasma concentration of pracinostat, a similar increase in histone acetylation was not observed. As an extension, 10 additional patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were enrolled to assess the safety and efficacy of pracinostat in combination with azacitidine. Six patients achieved a CR and 3 achieved a CR without platelet recovery with no added toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that pracinostat is safe, with modest single-agent activity in patients with hematological malignancies. Cancer 2017;123:4851-9.

T cells expressing 1928zT2 or m28zT2 showed improved expansion, persistency and effector function against CD19(+) leukemia or mesothelin(+) solid tumors respectively in vitro and in vivo. In a patient with relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a single dose of 5 x 10(4)/kg 1928zT2 T cells resulted in robust expansion and leukemia eradication and led to complete remission.

Abnormal expression of SOX4 is related to malignant tumor transformation and cancer metastasis. However, no reports are available regarding the clinical significance of SOX4 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the role of SOX4 in leukemogenesis. In the current study, we found that AML patients with low bone marrow (BM) SOX4 expression had higher remission rates and longer overall survival than those with high SOX4 expression, regardless of age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, karyotype profile and NPM1/FLT3-ITD status. To elucidate the role of SOX4 in leukemogenesis, we generated a transgenic zebrafish model that overexpressed human SOX4 in the myeloid lineage Tg(spi1-SOX4-EGFP). These transgenic zebrafish showed, at 5 months of age, increased myelopoiesis with dedifferentiation in kidney marrow.

At the same time, a high level of blood safety must be guaranteed and different guidelines (GLs) deal with this topic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of different GLs in preventing transfusion-transmissible infections (TTI) in Italian feline blood donors. Methods Blood samples were collected from 31 cats enrolled as blood donors by the owners' voluntary choice over a period of approximately 1 year. Possible risk factors for TTI were recorded. Based on Italian, European and American GLs, specific TTI, including haemoplasmas, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia species, Bartonella species, Babesia species, Theileria species, Cytauxzoon species, Leishmania donovani sensu lato and feline coronavirus (FCoV), were screened. Rapid antigen and serological tests and biomolecular investigations (PCR) were used. Several PCR protocols for haemoplasma and FeLV DNA were compared. Results The presence of at least one recognised risk factor for TTI was reported in all cats. Results for FIV and FeLV infections were negative using rapid tests, whereas five (16.1%) cats were positive for FCoV antibodies. Four (12.9%) cats were PCR positive for haemoplasma DNA and one (3.2%) for FeLV provirus, the latter being positive only using the most sensitive PCR protocol applied. Other TTI were not detected using PCR. Conclusions and relevance Blood safety increases by combining the recommendations of different GLs. To reduce the risk of TTI, sensitive tests are needed and the choice of the best protocol is a critical step in improving blood safety. The cost and time of the screening procedures may be reduced if appropriate tests are selected. To this end, the GLs should include appropriate recruitment protocols and questionnaire-based risk profiles to identify suitable donors.","['Marenzoni, Maria Luisa', 'Lauzi, Stefania', 'Miglio, Arianna', 'Coletti, Mauro', 'Arbia, Andrea', 'Paltrinieri, Saverio', 'Antognoni, Maria Teresa']","['Marenzoni ML', 'Lauzi S', 'Miglio A', 'Coletti M', 'Arbia A', 'Paltrinieri S', 'Antognoni MT']","['1 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', '2 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', '3 Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Milan, Lodi, Italy.', '4 Veterinary Transfusion Unit (EMOVET-UNIPG), Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', '1 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', '3 Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Milan, Lodi, Italy.', '2 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', '3 Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Milan, Lodi, Italy.', '4 Veterinary Transfusion Unit (EMOVET-UNIPG), Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20170825,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Transfusion/standards/statistics & numerical data/*veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/microbiology/parasitology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Cats', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Transfusion Reaction/microbiology/parasitology/prevention & control/*veterinary']",,,2017/08/26 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X17727233 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2018 Aug;20(8):663-673. doi: 10.1177/1098612X17727233.

CYLD is a tumor suppressor and a deubiquitination enzyme. CYLD negatively regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by deubiquitinating Dvl proteins. Loss of function and mutations of CYLD were linked to different types of solid tumors. Loss of function in CYLD is associated with Dvl hyper ubiquitination, resulting in the transmission of Wnt signaling to downstream effectors. beta-catenin upregulation is observed during disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Deregulated Dvl signaling may be a reason for beta-catenin activation in CML; and CYLD may contribute to Dvl deregulation. First, we evaluated mRNA expression in three CML cell lines and mRNA expression of the CYLD gene was found to be present in all (K562, MEG01, KU812). Unlike solid tumors sequencing revealed no mutations in the coding sequences of the CYLD gene. DVL genes were silenced by using a pool of siRNA oligonucleotides and gene expression differences in CYLD was determined by RT-PCR and western blot. CYLD protein expression decreased after Dvl silencing. An opposite approach of overexpressing Dvl proteins resulted in upregulated CYLD expression. While previous reports have described CYLD as a regulator of DVL proteins; our data suggests the presence of a more complicated reciprocal regulatory mechanism in CML cell lines.","['Caliskan, Ceyda', 'Pehlivan, Melek', 'Yuce, Zeynep', 'Sercan, Ogun']","['Caliskan C', 'Pehlivan M', 'Yuce Z', 'Sercan O']","['Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Balcova, 35340, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Izmir Institute of Technology, Balcova, 35340, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Balcova, 35340, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Vocational School of Health Sciences, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Balcova, 35340, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Balcova, 35340, Izmir, Turkey. ogun.sercan@deu.edu.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170824,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Dishevelled Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Dishevelled Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Ubiquitination', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'CYLD', 'Dishevelled', 'Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway']",2017/08/26 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-017-4122-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-017-4122-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2017 Oct;44(5):391-397. doi: 10.1007/s11033-017-4122-3.

However, there are no reports investigating whether human leukemia antigen (HLA)-A*0201(+) restriction is involved in the immune response caused by HERV-W env in neuropsychiatric diseases. In the present study, HERV-W env-derived epitopes presented by HLA-A*0201 are described with the potential for use in adoptive immunotherapy. Five peptides displaying HLA-A*0201-binding motifs were predicted using SYFEPITHI and BIMAS, and synthesized. A CCK-8 assay showed peptides W, Q and T promoted lymphocyte proliferation. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-A*0201(+) donors with each of these peptides induced peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells. High numbers of IFN-gamma-secreting T cells were also detectable after several weekly stimulations with W, Q and T. Besides lysis of HERV-W env-loaded target cells, specific apoptosis was also observed. These data demonstrate that human T cells can be sensitized toward HERV-W env peptides (W, Q and T) and, moreover, pose a high killing potential toward HERV-W env-expressing U251 cells. In conclusion, peptides W Q and T, which are HERV-W env antigenic epitopes, have both antigenicity and immunogenicity, and can cause strong T cell immune responses. Our data strengthen the view that HERV-W env should be considered as an autoantigen that can induce autoimmunity in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia.

Due to an engraftment failure during the first allo-HSCT of a matched related donor for CLL treatment, the salvage treatment was a second allo-HSCT. At the moment of meningioma-like tumor diagnosis, the patient was pancytopenic due to high-risk MDS, so it was decided to postpone a surgical intervention until hematological improvement. For the high-risk MDS of donor-cells origin the chosen treatment was induction with intensive chemotherapy. Due to refractory disease, the patient was treated with 5-azacitidine and donor-lymphocytes infusion with no response and, finally, a third allo-HSCT of a matched unrelated donor was performed. The patient died 6 months after the third allo-HSCT, in cytogenetic remission but without hematological recovery, due to an intracranial hemorrhage with origin in the meningioma-like tumor.","['Bras, G', 'Pinho-Vaz, C', 'Campos, A']","['Bras G', 'Pinho-Vaz C', 'Campos A']","['Servico de Transplante de Medula Ossea, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Servico de Transplante de Medula Ossea, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Servico de Transplante de Medula Ossea, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20170803,United States,Case Rep Med,Case reports in medicine,101512910,,,,,,2017/08/26 06:00,2017/08/26 06:01,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/9674385 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Med. 2017;2017:9674385. doi: 10.1155/2017/9674385.

METHODS: Approximately 25 specimens at each developmental stage of gastric carcinogenesis [non-atrophic gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and gastric carcinoma (GC)] with H. pylori infection [H. pylori (+)] and 25 normal gastric mucosa (NGM) without H. pylori infection [H. pylori (-)] were collected. After transcriptional factor array analysis, the Cx32 and PBX1 expression levels of H. pylori-infected tissues from the developmental stages of GC and NGM with no H. pylori infection were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Regarding H. pylori-infected animal models, the Cx32 and PBX1 mRNA expression levels and correlation between the gastric mucosa from 10 Mongolian gerbils with long-term H. pylori colonization and 10 controls were analyzed. PBX1 and Cx32 mRNA and protein levels were further studied under the H. pylori-infected condition as well as PBX1 overexpression and knockdown conditions in vitro. RESULTS: Incremental PBX1 was first detected by TF microarray in H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis. The identical trend of PBX1 and Cx32 expression was confirmed in the developmental stages of H. pylori-related clinical specimens. The negative correlation of PBX1 and Cx32 was confirmed in H. pylori-infected Mongolian gerbils. Furthermore, decreased PBX1 expression was detected in the normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 with H. pylori infection. Enforced overexpression or RNAi-mediated knockdown of PBX1 contributed to the diminished or restored Cx32 expression in GES-1 and the gastric carcinoma cell line BGC823, respectively. Finally, dual-luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells showed that Cx32 promoter activity decreased by 30% after PBX1 vector co-transfection, indicating PBX1 as a transcriptional downregulator of Cx32 by directly binding to its promoters. CONCLUSION: PBX1 is one of the determinants in the Cx32 promoter targeting site, preventing further damage of gap junction protein in H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis.","['Liu, Xiao-Ming', 'Xu, Can-Xia', 'Zhang, Lin-Fang', 'Huang, Li-Hua', 'Hu, Ting-Zi', 'Li, Rong', 'Xia, Xiu-Juan', 'Xu, Lin-Yong', 'Luo, Ling', 'Jiang, Xiao-Xia', 'Li, Ming']","['Liu XM', 'Xu CX', 'Zhang LF', 'Huang LH', 'Hu TZ', 'Li R', 'Xia XJ', 'Xu LY', 'Luo L', 'Jiang XX', 'Li M']","['Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.', 'Xiao-Ming Liu, Can-Xia Xu, Lin-Fang Zhang, Ting-Zi Hu, Rong Li, Xiu-Juan Xia, Ling Luo, Xiao-Xia Jiang, Ming Li, Department of Gastroenterology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, Hunan Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Connexins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (connexin 32)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*pathology', 'Carcinoma/microbiology/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Connexins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/microbiology/pathology', 'Gastritis, Atrophic/microbiology/pathology', 'Gastroscopy', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gerbillinae', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Helicobacter Infections/microbiology/*pathology', 'Helicobacter pylori/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metaplasia', 'Middle Aged', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Stomach/microbiology/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/microbiology/*pathology/surgery', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Carcinogenesis', 'Connexin 32', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Inflammation-carcinoma chain', 'PBX1']",2017/08/26 06:00,2018/05/11 06:00,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v23.i29.5345 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2017 Aug 7;23(29):5345-5355. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v23.i29.5345.,,,,PMC5550783,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest', 'related to this manuscript.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are well tolerated; somehow severe systemic side effects are rarely seen during treatment. Toxicities of skin and appendages may lead to poor compliance, psychosocial inconvenience, and drug interruption. Changes of the hair can arise following cures with TKI. Nilotinib, a second-generation TKI, has been responsible for various cutaneous side effects including different clinical presentations of alopecia (scarring and nonscarring forms). This paper reports the case of a 45-year-old male diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with nilotinib, who presented with a keratosis pilaris (KP)-like eruption, autoresolutive alopecia areata plaque of the wrist and diffuse eyebrow thinning. To date, eight cases of nilotinib-induced KP were reported. However, none of them was associated with alopecia areata. Hence, physicians need to be aware of this new cutaneous side effect and investigating the reason of this phenomenon requires additional studies.","['Tawil, Maya Halabi', 'El Khoury, Rana', 'Tomb, Roland', 'Ghosn, Marwan']","['Tawil MH', 'El Khoury R', 'Tomb R', 'Ghosn M']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Hotel Dieu de France University Hospital and Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Hotel Dieu de France University Hospital and Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Hotel Dieu de France University Hospital and Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, School of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Hotel Dieu de France University Hospital and Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,India,Int J Trichology,International journal of trichology,101534370,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alopecia areata', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'keratosis pilaris', 'nilotinib']",2017/08/26 06:00,2017/08/26 06:01,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/ijt.ijt_1_17 [doi]', 'IJT-9-87 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Trichology. 2017 Apr-Jun;9(2):87-89. doi: 10.4103/ijt.ijt_1_17.,,,,PMC5551315,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genes are also present in other species, but presence/absence, as well as functionality/non-functionality are species-dependent. Molecular mechanisms and forces that created this species divergence were unknown. Utilizing genomic information available from GenBank and Ensembl databases, gene order maps were constructed of a chromosomal region surrounding the ABO and GBGT1 genes from a variety of vertebrate species. Both similarities and differences were observed in their chromosomal organization. Interestingly, the ABO and GBGT1 genes were found located at the boundaries of chromosomal fragments that seem to have been inverted/translocated during species evolution. Genetic alterations, such as deletions and duplications, are prevalent at the ends of rearranged chromosomal fragments, which may partially explain the species-dependent divergence of those clinically important glycosyltransferase genes.","['Yamamoto, Fumiichiro']",['Yamamoto F'],"['Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain. fyamamoto@carrerasresearch.org.', ""Programa de Medicina Predictiva i Personalitzada del Cancer (PMPPC), Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain. fyamamoto@carrerasresearch.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170824,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Blood Group Antigens)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (GBGT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*genetics', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blood Group Antigens/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Vertebrates']",,,2017/08/26 06:00,2019/04/12 06:00,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-09765-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-09765-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Aug 24;7(1):9375. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-09765-2.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9690-7034'],PMC5571153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pro-survival signaling emanating from the microenvironment may foster therapeutic resistance of the malignant B cells resident in the protective lymphoid niches. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is critical to the survival of both healthy and neoplastic B cells. However, the pro-survival pathways triggered by BAFF have not been fully characterized. Here we show that BAFF elicited resistance to spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis in stromal co-cultures, induced activation of both canonical and non-canonical NFkappaB signaling pathways, and triggered B-cell receptor signaling in CLL cells, independently of IGHV mutational status. SYK, a proximal kinase in the B-cell receptor signaling cascade, acted via STAT3 to bolster transcription of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, thereby contributing to apoptosis resistance in BAFF-stimulated cells. SYK inhibitor entospletinib downregulated Mcl-1, abrogating BAFF-mediated cell survival. BAFF-B-cell receptor crosstalk in neoplastic B cells was mediated by SYK interaction with TRAF2/TRAF3 complex. Thus, SYK inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy uniquely poised to antagonize crosstalk between BAFF and B-cell receptor, thereby disrupting the pro-survival microenvironment signaling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Paiva, Cody', 'Rowland, Taylor A', 'Sreekantham, Bhargava', 'Godbersen, Claire', 'Best, Scott R', 'Kaur, Prabhjot', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Spurgeon, Stephen E F', 'Danilova, Olga V', 'Danilov, Alexey V']","['Paiva C', 'Rowland TA', 'Sreekantham B', 'Godbersen C', 'Best SR', 'Kaur P', 'Loriaux MM', 'Spurgeon SEF', 'Danilova OV', 'Danilov AV']","['Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Pathology, Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA danilov@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170824,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/*metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cricetulus', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2/metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3']",,,2017/08/26 06:00,2018/06/22 06:00,['2017/08/26 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.170571 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.170571 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Nov;102(11):1890-1900. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.170571.

Given their importance, it is predictable that dysregulation of MiRNAs, which target a wide variety of transcripts, can result in malignant transformation. In this review, we explore the discovery of MiRNAs, their mechanism of action, and the tools that aid in their discovery and study. Strikingly, many of the studies that have expanded our understanding of the contributions of MiRNAs to normal physiology and in the development of diseases have come from studies in the hematopoietic system and hematologic malignancies, with some of the earliest identified functions for mammalian MiRNAs coming from observations made in leukemias. So, with a special focus on the hematologic system, we will discuss how MiRNAs contribute to differentiation of stem cells and how dysregulation of MiRNAs contributes to the development of malignancy, by providing examples of specific MiRNAs that function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, as well as of defects in MiRNA processing. Finally, we will discuss the promise of MiRNA-based therapeutics and challenges for the future study of disease-causing MiRNAs.","['Weiss, Cary N', 'Ito, Keisuke']","['Weiss CN', 'Ito K']","['Ruth L. and David S.

Significant activity against leukemia in mice was demonstrated for extracts of Cephalotaxus. Cephalotaxine (CET) (1), the major alkaloid of this series was isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea species by Paudler in 1963. The subsequent discovery of promising antitumor activity among new Cephalotaxus derivatives reported by Chinese, Japanese, and American teams triggered extensive structure elucidation and biological studies in this family. The structural feature of this cephalotaxane family relies mainly on its tetracyclic alkaloid backbone, which comprises an azaspiranic 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane unit (rings C and D) and a benzazepine ring system (rings A and B), which is linked by its C3 alcohol function to a chiral oxygenated side chain by a carboxylic function alpha to a tetrasubstituted carbon center. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids is limited to the Cephalotaxus genus (Cephalotaxaceae). The scope of biological activities of the Cephalotaxus alkaloids is mainly centered on the antileukemic activity of homoharringtonine (HHT) (2), which in particular demonstrated marked benefits in the treatment of orphan myeloid leukemia and was approved as soon as 2009 by European Medicine Agency and by US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Its exact mechanism of action was partly elucidated and it was early recognized that HHT (2) inhibited protein synthesis at the level of the ribosome machinery. Interestingly, after a latency period of two decades, the topic of Cephalotaxus alkaloids reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures. To date, more than 70 compounds have been identified and characterized. Synthetic studies also regained attention during the past two decades, and numerous methodologies were developed to access the first semisynthetic HHT (2) of high purity suitable for clinical studies, and then high grade enantiomerically pure CET (1), HHT (2), and analogs.","['Perard-Viret, Joelle', 'Quteishat, Laith', 'Alsalim, Rana', 'Royer, Jacques', 'Dumas, Francoise']","['Perard-Viret J', 'Quteishat L', 'Alsalim R', 'Royer J', 'Dumas F']","['Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS, Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, CNRS, Universite Paris Saclay, Chatenay-Malabry, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, CNRS, Universite Paris Saclay, Chatenay-Malabry, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS, Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, CNRS, Universite Paris Saclay, Chatenay-Malabry, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170816,United States,Alkaloids Chem Biol,The Alkaloids.

EUTOS high-risk patients exhibited significantly worse outcomes in terms of event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and CML-associated death than those considered to be low-risk. Risk stratification by EUTOS score was predictive of risk-associated clinical outcomes in patients classified into the imatinib group; however, the EUTOS score failed to predict the outcomes of patients classified into the 2nd TKI group.

Methods and results: Using data from Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation, we aimed to characterize AF patients with cancer, to describe their management and to assess the association between cancer and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Among 9749 patients, 23.8% had history of cancer (57% solid malignancy, 1.3% leukaemia, 3.3% lymphoma, 40% other type, and 2.2% metastatic cancer). Patients with history of cancer were older, more likely to have CV disease, CV risk factors, and prior gastrointestinal bleeding. No difference in antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic therapy was observed between those with and without cancer. Patients with history of cancer had a significantly higher risk of death (7.8 vs. 4.9 deaths per 100 patient-years follow-up, P = 0.0003) mainly driven by non-CV death (4.2 vs. 2.4 per 100 patient-years follow-up; P = 0.0004) and higher risk of major bleeding (5.1 vs. 3.5 per 100 patient-years follow-up; P = 0.02) compared with non-cancer patients; no differences were observed in risks of strokes/non-central nervous system embolism (1.96 vs. 1.48, P = 0.74) and CV death (2.89 vs. 2.07, P = 0.35) between the two groups. Conclusion: A history of cancer is common among AF patients with up to one in four patients having both. Antithrombotic therapy, rates of cerebrovascular accident, other thrombotic events and cardiac death were similar in AF patients with or without a history of cancer. Patients with cancer, however, were at higher risk of major bleeding and non-CV death.","['Melloni, Chiara', 'Shrader, Peter', 'Carver, Joseph', 'Piccini, Jonathan P', 'Thomas, Laine', 'Fonarow, Gregg C', 'Ansell, Jack', 'Gersh, Bernard', 'Go, Alan S', 'Hylek, Elaine', 'Herling, Irving M', 'Mahaffey, Kenneth W', 'Yu, Anthony F', 'Peterson, Eric D', 'Kowey, Peter R']","['Melloni C', 'Shrader P', 'Carver J', 'Piccini JP', 'Thomas L', 'Fonarow GC', 'Ansell J', 'Gersh B', 'Go AS', 'Hylek E', 'Herling IM', 'Mahaffey KW', 'Yu AF', 'Peterson ED', 'Kowey PR']","['Duke University Medical Center, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'UCLA Division of Cardiology, 10833 Le Conte Ave, CHS BH 307, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Lenox Hill Hospital, New York University School of Medicine, 6 Blackhall 100 East 77th Street, New York, NY 10075, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street, SW Gonda 5-368 Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente of Northern California 2000 Broadway Street, Oakland, CA, USA.', 'Boston University Medical Center, Research Unit-Section of General Internal Medicine, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA 02118, USA.', 'The Heart Institute at Lankenau Medical Center, Lankenau MOB, 100 Lancaster Avenue, Wynnewood, PA 19096, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 885 2nd Ave New York, NY 10017, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, DCRI, North Pavilion, 2400 Pratt Street, Durham, NC 27705, USA.', 'MLH Heart Center, Lankenau MOB, 100 Lancaster Avenue, Wynnewood, PA 19096, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,European heart journal.

However, an optimal method for its detection has not yet been specified. The aim of our study was to examine the presence of the NOTCH1 mutation in CLL using three commonly used molecular methods. Sanger sequencing, fragment analysis and allele-specific PCR were compared in the detection of the c.7541_7542delCT NOTCH1 mutation in 201 CLL patients. In 7 patients with inconclusive mutational analysis results, the presence of the NOTCH1 mutation was also confirmed using ultra-deep next generation sequencing. The NOTCH1 mutation was detected in 15% (30/201) of examined patients. Only fragment analysis was able to identify all 30 NOTCH1-mutated patients. Sanger sequencing and allele-specific PCR showed a lower detection efficiency, determining 93% (28/30) and 80% (24/30) of the present NOTCH1 mutations, respectively. Considering these three most commonly used methodologies for c.7541_7542delCT NOTCH1 mutation screening in CLL, we defined fragment analysis as the most suitable approach for detecting the hotspot NOTCH1 mutation.","['Vavrova, Eva', 'Kantorova, Barbara', 'Vonkova, Barbara', 'Kabathova, Jitka', 'Skuhrova-Francova, Hana', 'Diviskova, Eva', 'Letocha, Ondrej', 'Kotaskova, Jana', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Pospisilova, Sarka']","['Vavrova E', 'Kantorova B', 'Vonkova B', 'Kabathova J', 'Skuhrova-Francova H', 'Diviskova E', 'Letocha O', 'Kotaskova J', 'Brychtova Y', 'Doubek M', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S']","['Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00 Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00 Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00 Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00 Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00 Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Cernopolni 9, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.

However, the risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia and the clinical outcomes following unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT remain unknown. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: Nineteen patients with HSV-1/2 viremia and fifty-seven patients without HSV-1/2 viremia which were selected using the case-pair method after undergoing haploidentical HSCT were enrolled. We analysed the risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia and compared the clinical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: The risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia included HLA disparity >/=2 loci (p=0.049) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (p=0.028). The incidences of platelet engraftment, oral mucositis and severe haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in patients with and without HSV-1/2 viremia were 77% and 94% (p=0.003), 78% and 13% (p=0.000), and 25% and 6% (p=0.04), respectively. Moreover, the median time to platelet engraftment in patients with and without HSV-1/2 viremia was +25days (range, +11-+80) and +17days (range, +8-+67) (p=0.004), respectively. According to the multivariate analyses, HSV-1/2 viremia was associated with delayed platelet engraftment (p=0.038), a higher incidence of oral mucositis (p=0.000) and severe HC (p=0.038). However, HSV-1/2 viremia was not associated with non-relapse mortality (34.0% vs. 31.5%, p=0.26), leukaemia-free survival (60.9% vs. 57.9%, p=0.46) and overall survival (61.2% vs. 60.7%, p=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, we recommend that HSV-1/2 PCR should be performed upon clinical suspicion of HSV-1/2 infection.","['Tang, Fei-Fei', 'Zhao, Xiao-Su', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Sun, Yu-Qian', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Tang FF', 'Zhao XS', 'Xu LP', 'Zhang XH', 'Chen YH', 'Mo XD', 'Sun YQ', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.

The demographics of those affected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS and KS have changed, and individuals with HIV/AIDS and KS now live longer. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that the secondary cancers developing in patients with KS have changed in recent years and to assess the risk of secondary cancers after KS in different periods. Design, Setting, and Participants: Longitudinal data from 9 cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were used to identify cases of KS diagnosed from January 1973 to December 2013. The dates of the analysis were November 2016 to February 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the development of secondary cancers in individuals with KS. Secondary cancers were considered only if diagnosed 2 months after a diagnosis of KS. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for the development of new secondary cancers in the pre-AIDS era (1973-1979), pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (1980-1995), and HAART era (1996-2013). Stratified analysis was then performed on a subset of the cases diagnosed from 1996 to 2013 based on age at diagnosis (<65 and >/=65 years), latency period between KS and the development of secondary cancers (1 year, 2-5 years, >5 to 10 years, and >10 years), and registries with higher vs lower reported rates of HIV/AIDS. Results: Among 14905 individuals with diagnosed KS, 13721 (92.1%) were younger than 65 years at the time of diagnosis, and 14356 (96.3%) were male. From 1980 to 1995, SIRs were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.00-3.60) for cancer of the rectum, 49.70 (95% CI, 33.53-70.94) for cancer of the anus, 4.98 (95% CI, 2.79-8.22) for cancer of the liver, 13.70 (95% CI, 2.82-40.03) for cancer of the cervix, 6.40 (95% CI, 2.76-12.60) for Hodgkin lymphoma, and 48.97 (95% CI, 44.85-53.36) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. From 1996 to 2013, cancer of the anus, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cancer of the liver remained associated with KS, with the addition of the following significant SIRs: 6.99 (95% CI, 3.20-13.27) for cancer of the tongue, 10.28 (95% CI, 1.24-37.13) for cancer of the penis, and 17.62 (95% CI, 3.63-51.49) for acute lymphocytic leukemia. The SIR of developing any tumor after KS decreased significantly from 3.36 to 1.94 from the pre-HAART era to the HAART era. Conclusions and Relevance: There has been a significant decline in the overall risk of secondary cancers after KS. Certain cancers, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, cancer of the tongue, and cancer of the penis, are increasingly becoming more common in the HAART era compared with the pre-HAART era. Close monitoring and screening for these secondary cancers is desirable in patients with KS.","['Mukhtar, Fahad', 'Ilozumba, Mmadili', 'Utuama, Ovie', 'Cimenler, Oguz']","['Mukhtar F', 'Ilozumba M', 'Utuama O', 'Cimenler O']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active/adverse effects/methods', 'Female', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections/complications/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/complications/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2017/08/25 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['2649758 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.2395 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2018 Jan 1;4(1):48-53. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.2395.,,,,PMC5833655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Participants included 982 cancer survivors (9 to 26 years of age; 1 to 5 years postcompletion of therapy); we assessed HPV vaccine initiation, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and vaccine-specific health beliefs; age-, sex-, and year-matched US population comparisons were from the National Immunization Survey-Teen and the National Health Interview Survey (2012-2015). Results: The mean age at the time of the study was 16.3 +/- 4.7 years; the mean time off therapy was 2.7 +/- 1.2 years; participants were 55% male and 66% non-Hispanic white; 59% had leukemia/lymphoma. Vaccine initiation rates were significantly lower in cancer survivors versus the general population (23.8%; 95% CI, 20.6% to 27.0% v 40.5%; 95% CI, 40.2% to 40.7%; P < .001); survivors were more likely to be HPV vaccine-naive than general population peers (odds ratio [OR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.09; P < .001). Initiation in adolescent survivors (ages 13 to 17 years) was 22.0% (95% CI, 17.3% to 26.7%), significantly lower than population peers (42.5%; 95% CI, 42.2% to 42.8%; P < .001). Initiation in young adult survivors and peers (ages 18 to 26 years) was comparably low (25.3%; 95% CI, 20.9% to 29.7% v 24.2%; 95% CI, 23.6% to 24.9%). Predictors of noninitiation included lack of provider recommendation (OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 6.5 to 18.0; P < .001), survivors' perceived lack of insurance coverage for HPV vaccine (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 3.9 to 11.0; P < .001), male sex (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 4.8; P < .001), endorsement of vaccine-related barriers (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.6; P < .001), and younger age (9 to 12 years; OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8-7.6; P < .001; comparison, 13 to 17 years). Conclusion: HPV vaccine initiation rates in cancer survivors are low. Lack of provider recommendation and barriers to vaccine receipt should be targeted in vaccine promotion efforts.","['Klosky, James L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Connelly, James A', 'Wasilewski-Masker, Karen', 'Sun, Can-Lan', 'Francisco, Liton', 'Gustafson, Laura', 'Russell, Kathryn M', 'Sabbatini, Gina', 'Flynn, Jessica S', 'York, Jocelyn M', 'Giuliano, Anna R', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Wong, F Lennie', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Landier, Wendy']","['Klosky JL', 'Hudson MM', 'Chen Y', 'Connelly JA', 'Wasilewski-Masker K', 'Sun CL', 'Francisco L', 'Gustafson L', 'Russell KM', 'Sabbatini G', 'Flynn JS', 'York JM', 'Giuliano AR', 'Robison LL', 'Wong FL', 'Bhatia S', 'Landier W']","[""James L.

The addition of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to standard chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in adults with ALL. However, it is unknown whether the addition of rituximab is cost-effective. The objective was to determine the economic impact of rituximab in addition to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy vs SOC alone in newly-diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative, CD20-positive, B-cell precursor ALL. METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed, based upon the Canadian healthcare system. It included the following health states over a lifetime horizon (max approximately 60 years): event-free survival (EFS), relapsed/resistant disease, cure, and death. SOC was either hyper-CVAD or the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL consortium. EFS, overall survival, and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were derived from a large randomized controlled trial. Costs of the model included: first-line treatment and administration, disease management, second-line and third-line treatment and administration, palliative care, and SAE-related treatments. Inputs were sourced from provincial and national public data, the literature, and cancer agency input. RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 2.20 QALYs with rituximab in addition to SOC. The resulting mean Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was C$21,828/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of C$100,000/QALY, the probability of being cost-effective was 98%. Decision outcomes were robust to the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses, including the SOC backbone as either hyper-CVAD or DFCI. LIMITATIONS: The results of this analysis are limited by generalizability of the chemotherapy backbone to Canadian practice. CONCLUSIONS: For adults with ALL, rituximab in addition to SOC was found to be a cost-effective intervention, compared to SOC alone. The addition of rituximab is associated with increased life years and increased QALYs at a reasonable incremental cost.","['Nam, Julian', 'Milenkovski, Robert', 'Yunger, Simon', 'Geirnaert, Marc', 'Paulson, Kristjan', 'Seftel, Matthew']","['Nam J', 'Milenkovski R', 'Yunger S', 'Geirnaert M', 'Paulson K', 'Seftel M']","['a Hoffmann-La Roche Limited , Mississauga , ON , Canada.', 'a Hoffmann-La Roche Limited , Mississauga , ON , Canada.', 'a Hoffmann-La Roche Limited , Mississauga , ON , Canada.', 'b CancerCare Manitoba , Winnipeg , MB Canada.', 'b CancerCare Manitoba , Winnipeg , MB Canada.', 'c University of Manitoba , Winnipeg , MB Canada.', 'b CancerCare Manitoba , Winnipeg , MB Canada.', 'c University of Manitoba , Winnipeg , MB Canada.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20170918,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/economics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Canada', 'Cohort Studies', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/economics/mortality', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rituximab/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Standard of Care/economics', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cost-effectiveness', 'rituximab']",2017/08/25 06:00,2018/08/23 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2017.1372230 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Jan;21(1):47-59. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2017.1372230.

We encountered a systemic JXG case involving the bone marrow, multiple bones, and the skin during acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. A 16-year-old boy undergoing ALL treatment experienced unexplained prolonged fever and scalp, hip joint, and right knee joint pain for 2 weeks during interim maintenance chemotherapy. Bone marrow pathologic findings revealed no evidence of leukemia relapse but showed diffuse infiltration of histiocytes with several Touton-type giant cells; the stains were positive for CD68 and negative for CD1a and S100 protein. Bone and skin biopsies confirmed the findings. Symptoms have resolved since maintenance chemotherapy, which included vincristine, dexamethasone, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate.

Recently, we found that microvesicles released from human leukemia cell line K562 (K562-MVs) containing BCR-ABL1 mRNA malignantly transformed normal hematopoietic transplants. Here, we investigated whether K562-MVs contribute to the transformation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). We showed that K562-MVs could be integrated into co-cultured normal BM-MSCs and dose-dependently enhanced the proliferation of BM-MSCs. Meanwhile, K562-MVs (400 ng/mL) significantly increased the expression of BCR-ABL1 in these BM-MSCs, accompanied by the enhanced secretion of TGF-beta1. These BM-MSCs in turn could trigger the TGF-beta1-dependent proliferation of K562 cells. Moreover, we confirmed the presence of BCR-ABL1 in circulating MVs from 11 CML patients. Compared to the normal BM-MSCs, the BM-MSCs from CML patients more effectively increased the BCR-ABL1 expression and TGF-beta1 secretion in K562 cells as well as the proliferation of K562 cells. Our findings enrich the mechanisms involved in the interaction between leukemia cells and BM-MSCs and provide novel ways to monitor minimal residual disease and worthwhile approaches to treat CML.","['Fu, Fen-Fen', 'Zhu, Xiao-Jian', 'Wang, Hong-Xiang', 'Zhang, Li-Ming', 'Yuan, Guo-Lin', 'Chen, Zhi-Chao', 'Li, Qiu-Bai']","['Fu FF', 'Zhu XJ', 'Wang HX', 'Zhang LM', 'Yuan GL', 'Chen ZC', 'Li QB']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450000, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan Central Hospital, Wuhan 430000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jinzhou Central Hospital, Jinzhou 434020, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang 441021, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170824,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Cell-Free Nucleic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell-Free Nucleic Acids/blood/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/08/25 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['aps2017116 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2017.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2017 Nov;38(11):1475-1485. doi: 10.1038/aps.2017.116.

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are severe complications in these patients during chemotherapy. This study aimed to explore the clinical presentation and etiology of BSI, as well as the common sites of infection, and to provide a basis for the rational regarding antibiotic use. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients who had acute leukemia accompanied by a BSI in our hospital from December 2011 to September 2015. All patients were selected based on clinical presentation and had to have at least one positive blood culture for inclusion. The basic clinical characteristics, blood culture results, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were analyzed. RESULTS: All 231 patients had a fever; of them, 12 patients continued to have a fever. Twenty-five patients had nonremitting (NR) leukemia, and 206 patients achieved complete remission (CR). Differences in the duration of fever between the NR and CR groups were significant (9.6 +/- 7.9 vs. 5.1 +/- 3.8 days, P= 0.016). One hundred and eighty patients had agranulocytosis. Differences in fever duration between the agranulocytosis and nonagranulocytosis groups were significant (6.2 +/- 5.1 vs. 4.1 +/- 2.6 days, P= 0.001). The other sites of infection in these 231 patients were the lung, mouth, digestive tract, and rectum. Blood culture comprised 2635 samples. There were 619 samples, which were positive. Of the 619 positive blood culture samples, 59.9% had Gram-negative bacteria, 39.3% had Gram-positive bacteria, and 0.8% had fungus. The primary pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobactercloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of these 231 patients, 217 patients were cured. The effective treatment ratio was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria were the main pathogenic bacteria in patients with acute leukemia in our center. NR primary illness, agranulocytosis, and drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria were all risk factors for poor prognosis.","['Yao, Jia-Feng', 'Li, Nan', 'Jiang, Jin']","['Yao JF', 'Li N', 'Jiang J']","[""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Agranulocytosis/etiology/pathology', 'Bacteremia/*etiology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/pathogenicity', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2017/08/25 06:00,2018/05/15 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2017_130_17_2076_213411 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.213411 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2017 Sep 5;130(17):2076-2081. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.213411.,,,,PMC5586176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to evaluate the overexpression of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in Wharton's jelly stem cells (WJSCs) in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, a DNA construction containing IL- 4, IL-10 and LIF was assembled to make a polycistronic vector (as the transfer vector). Transfer and control vectors were co-transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK-293T) cells with helper plasmids which produced recombinant lentiviral viruses (rLV). WJSCs were transduced with rLV to make recombinant WJSC (rWJSC). In vitro protein and mRNA overexpression of IL-4, LIF, and IL-10 were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB) analysis. EAE was induced in mice by MOG-CFA and pertussis toxin. EAE mice were injected twice with 2x105 rWJSCs. The in vivo level of IL-4, LIF, IL-10 cytokines and IL-17 were measured by ELISA. Brain tissues were analyzed histologically for evaluation of EAE lesions. RESULTS: Isolated WJSCs were performed to characterize by in vitro differentiation and surface markers were analyzed by flow cytometry method. Cloning of a single lentiviral vector with five genes was done successfully. Transfection of transfer and control vectors were processed based on CaPO4 method with >90% efficiency. Recombinant viruses were produced and results of titration showed 2-3x107 infection-unit/ml. WJSCs were transduced using recombinant viruses. IL-4, IL-10 and LIF overexpression were confirmed by ELISA, WB and qPCR. The EAE mice treated with rWJSC showed reduction of Il-17, and brain lesions as well as brain cellular infiltration, in vivo. Weights and physical activity were improved in gene-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that gene therapy using anti-inflammatory cytokines can be a promising approach against multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, considering the immunomodulatory potential of WJSCs, an approach using a combination of WJSCs and gene therapy will enhance the treatment efficacy.","['Hosseini, Ahmad', 'Estiri, Hajar', 'Akhavan Niaki, Haleh', 'Alizadeh, Akram', 'Abdolhossein Zadeh, Baharak', 'Ghaderian, Sayyed Mohammad Hossein', 'Farjadfar, Akbar', 'Fallah, Ali']","['Hosseini A', 'Estiri H', 'Akhavan Niaki H', 'Alizadeh A', 'Abdolhossein Zadeh B', 'Ghaderian SMH', 'Farjadfar A', 'Fallah A']","['Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomical Science, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Our aim was to examine whether cancer survivors have higher risks of poor outcomes in pregnancies conceived after diagnosis than women without cancer, and whether these risks differ by cancer type and race. Diagnoses from cancer registries were linked to pregnancy outcomes from birth certificates in three U.S. states. Analyses were limited to the first, live singleton birth conceived after diagnosis. Births to women without a previous cancer diagnosis in the registry were matched to cancer survivors on age at delivery, parity, race/ethnicity and education. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate risk ratios. Cervical cancer survivors had higher risks of preterm birth (Risk ratio = 2.8, 95% Confidence interval: 2.1, 3.7), as did survivors of invasive breast cancer (RR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7) and leukemia (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.5). We observed a higher risk of small for gestational age (SGA) infants (<10% of weight for age based on a national distribution) in survivors of brain cancer (RR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.8) and extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.6). We did not see an increased risk of infants born preterm, low birth weight, or SGA in pregnancies conceived after ductal carcinoma in situ, thyroid cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma. While our results are reassuring for survivors of many cancers, some will need closer monitoring during pregnancy.","['Hartnett, Kathleen P', 'Ward, Kevin C', 'Kramer, Michael R', 'Lash, Timothy L', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Spencer, Jessica B', 'Fothergill, Amy', 'Howards, Penelope P']","['Hartnett KP', 'Ward KC', 'Kramer MR', 'Lash TL', 'Mertens AC', 'Spencer JB', 'Fothergill A', 'Howards PP']","['Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Georgia Cancer Registry, Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics, Atlanta, GA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Cancer Prevention and Control Research Program, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Cancer Prevention and Control Research Program, Atlanta, GA.', 'Aflac Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Cancer Prevention and Control Research Program, Atlanta, GA.', ""Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Cancer Survivorship Program, Atlanta, GA."", 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Cancer Prevention and Control Research Program, Atlanta, GA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170824,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*birth outcome', '*cancer survivor', '*pregnancy']",2017/08/25 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30914 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 Dec 1;141(11):2187-2196. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30914.

However, despite its high efficiency, resistance to imatinib has emerged as a significant problem, which may in part be caused by pharmacogenetic variability. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (C1236T, G2677T/A, C3435T) and/or mRNA expression changes of ABCB1 gene were demonstrated to be associated with inter-individual variability of imatinib response in CML patients. In this study, we aimed to examine whether genetic variations and/or altered expression of ABCB1 gene may influence response to imatinib. METHODS: Sixty nine CML Tunisian patients, undergoing imatinib therapy, were enrolled in this study. These were divided into two groups: responders and non-responders to imatinib. The relative transcript expression levels of ABCB1 gene and the distribution of allele and genotype frequency of ABCB1 SNPs were compared between these two categories of patients. Linkage disequilibrium tests and haplotypes analysis were also studied. RESULTS: Our results showed that the mRNA expression level of ABCB1 gene did not differ significantly between the two categories of patients. In addition, results obtained from ABCB1 polymorphisms study and their correlation with imatinib response showed that the optimal response rate to imatinib did not differ significantly between C1236T, G2677T/A or C3435T genotypes. However, haplotype analysis showed that the 1236C-2677A-3435C haplotype was observed only in imatinib non-responders' patients suggesting that CAC haplotype was linked to higher risk of imatinib resistance. CONCLUSION: Furthermore, analyses of ABCB1 haplotypes should be taken into account to study the relationship between ABCB1 genotypes and imatinib efficacy.","['Ben Hassine, Islem', 'Gharbi, Hanene', 'Soltani, Ismail', 'Ben Hadj Othman, Hind', 'Farrah, Ahlem', 'Amouri, Hassiba', 'Teber, Mouheb', 'Ghedira, Hela', 'Ben Youssef, Yosra', 'Safra, Ines', 'Abbes, Salem', 'Menif, Samia']","['Ben Hassine I', 'Gharbi H', 'Soltani I', 'Ben Hadj Othman H', 'Farrah A', 'Amouri H', 'Teber M', 'Ghedira H', 'Ben Youssef Y', 'Safra I', 'Abbes S', 'Menif S']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia. benhassine.islem@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Tunis, Universite de Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Tunis, Universite de Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Tunis, Universite de Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Tunis, Universite de Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tunisia', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Haplotypes', 'Imatinib mesylate', 'Polymorphisms', 'Resistance', 'mRNA expression']",2017/08/25 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-017-3424-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-017-3424-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2017 Oct;80(4):829-839. doi: 10.1007/s00280-017-3424-4.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a proliferative factor on the expansion and proliferation of human endometrial stromal cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, the isolated and cultured human endometrial stromal cells from women at ovulatory phase aged 20-35 years, after fourth passage were divided into control and LIF-treated groups. In the experimental group, the endometrial cells were treated by 10 ng/ml LIF in culture media and the cultured cells without adding LIF considered as control group. Both groups were evaluated and compared for proliferation rate using MTT assay, for CD90 marker by flow cytometric analysis and for the expression of Oct4, Nanog, PCNA and LIFr genes using real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The proliferation rate of control and LIF-treated groups were 1.17+/-0.17 and 1.61+/-0.06 respectively and there was a significant increase in endometrial stromal cell proliferation following in vitro treatment by LIF compared to control group (p=0.049). The rate of CD90 positive cells was significantly increased in LIF-treated group (98.96+/-0.37%) compared to control group (94.26+/-0.08%) (p=0.0498). Also, the expression ratio of all studied genes was significantly increased in the LIF-treated group compared to control group (p=0.0479). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that LIF has a great impact on proliferation, survival, and maintenance of pluripotency of human endometrial stromal cells and it could be applicable in cell therapies.","['Salehnia, Mojdeh', 'Fayazi, Mehri', 'Ehsani, Shokreya']","['Salehnia M', 'Fayazi M', 'Ehsani S']","['Anatomy Department, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Anatomy Department, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Najafabad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Najafabad, Iran.', 'Anatomy Department, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Reprod Biomed,International journal of reproductive biomedicine,101679102,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell proliferation', 'Endometrium', 'Gene expression', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'Stromal cells']",2017/08/25 06:00,2017/08/25 06:01,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Reprod Biomed. 2017 Apr;15(4):209-216.,,,,PMC5555038,['No any conflict of interest for this study.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that, in addition to causing genetic change, impaired DNA replication during embryonic development can have major epigenetic consequences for a genome. In a genome-wide screen, we identified impaired DNA replication as a cause of increased expression from a repressed transgene in Caenorhabditis elegans. The acquired expression state behaved as an ""epiallele,"" being inherited for multiple generations before fully resetting. Derepression was not restricted to the transgene but was caused by a global reduction in heterochromatin-associated histone modifications due to the impaired retention of modified histones on DNA during replication in the early embryo. Impaired DNA replication during development can therefore globally derepress chromatin, creating new intergenerationally inherited epigenetic expression states.","['Klosin, Adam', 'Reis, Kadri', 'Hidalgo-Carcedo, Cristina', 'Casas, Eduard', 'Vavouri, Tanya', 'Lehner, Ben']","['Klosin A', 'Reis K', 'Hidalgo-Carcedo C', 'Casas E', 'Vavouri T', 'Lehner B']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory-Centre for Genomic Regulation (EMBL-CRG) Systems Biology Unit, CRG, the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory-Centre for Genomic Regulation (EMBL-CRG) Systems Biology Unit, CRG, the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory-Centre for Genomic Regulation (EMBL-CRG) Systems Biology Unit, CRG, the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer-Institute Germans Trias i Pujol, Can Ruti Campus, Ctra de Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles s/n, Badalona, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer-Institute Germans Trias i Pujol, Can Ruti Campus, Ctra de Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles s/n, Badalona, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Can Ruti Campus, Ctra de Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles s/n, Badalona, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory-Centre for Genomic Regulation (EMBL-CRG) Systems Biology Unit, CRG, the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, 08010 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170816,United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*DNA Replication', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histones/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Time-Lapse Imaging']",,,2017/08/25 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1126/sciadv.1701143 [doi]', '1701143 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2017 Aug 16;3(8):e1701143. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1701143. eCollection 2017 Aug.,['616434/ERC_/European Research Council/International'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9144-6184', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3571-2449', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2352-9049', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8817-1124']",PMC5559210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can be accomplished by identifying the genetic mechanisms and mutations driving the transition of a normal plasma cell to one with the features of the following disease stages: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smouldering myeloma, myeloma and plasma cell leukaemia. Although myeloma initiating events are clonal, subsequent driver lesions often occur in a subclone of cells, facilitating progression by Darwinian selection processes. Understanding the co-evolution of the clones within their microenvironment will be crucial for therapeutically manipulating the process. The end stage of progression is the generation of a state associated with treatment resistance, increased proliferation, evasion of apoptosis and an ability to grow independently of the bone marrow microenvironment. In this Review, we discuss these end-stage high-risk disease states and how new information is improving our understanding of their evolutionary trajectories, how they may be diagnosed and the biological behaviour that must be addressed if they are to be treated effectively.","['Pawlyn, Charlotte', 'Morgan, Gareth J']","['Pawlyn C', 'Morgan GJ']","['The Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Sutton SM2 5NG, UK.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

To test the hypothesis that natural killer (NK) cells can decrease the risk of leukemia relapse, we initiated a phase 1 dose-escalation study of membrane-bound interleukin 21 (mbIL21) expanded donor NK cells infused before and after haploidentical HSCT for high-risk myeloid malignancies. The goals were to determine the safety, feasibility, and maximum tolerated dose. Patients received a melphalan-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and posttransplant cyclophosphamide-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. NK cells were infused on days -2, +7, and +28 posttransplant. All NK expansions achieved the required cell number, and 11 of 13 patients enrolled received all 3 planned NK-cell doses (1 x 10(5)/kg to 1 x 10(8)/kg per dose). No infusional reactions or dose-limiting toxicities occurred. All patients engrafted with donor cells. Seven patients (54%) developed grade 1-2 acute GVHD (aGVHD), none developed grade 3-4 aGVHD or chronic GVHD, and a low incidence of viral complications was observed. One patient died of nonrelapse mortality; 1 patient relapsed. All others were alive and in remission at last follow-up (median, 14.7 months). NK-cell reconstitution was quantitatively, phenotypically, and functionally superior compared with a similar group of patients not receiving NK cells. In conclusion, this trial demonstrated production feasibility and safety of infusing high doses of ex vivo-expanded NK cells after haploidentical HSCT without adverse effects, increased GVHD, or higher mortality, and was associated with significantly improved NK-cell number and function, lower viral infections, and low relapse rate posttransplant.","['Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Schafer, Jolie R', 'Bassett, Roland', 'Denman, Cecele J', 'Cao, Kai', 'Willis, Dana', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Soebbing, Doris', 'Kaur, Indreshpal', 'Gulbis, Alison', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Lee, Dean A', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Ciurea SO', 'Schafer JR', 'Bassett R', 'Denman CJ', 'Cao K', 'Willis D', 'Rondon G', 'Chen J', 'Soebbing D', 'Kaur I', 'Gulbis A', 'Ahmed S', 'Rezvani K', 'Shpall EJ', 'Lee DA', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Biostatistics.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Good Manufacturing Practice Laboratory, and.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20170823,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Component Transfusion/*methods', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/physiology/*transplantation', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/08/25 06:00,2017/11/01 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32783-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-05-785659 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Oct 19;130(16):1857-1868. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-785659.

We assessed the characteristics and prognostic impact of 598 patients with CP-CML treated on clinical trials with various TKIs. CCA/Ph(-) occurred in 58 patients (10%); the most common were -Y in 25 (43%) and trisomy 8 in 7 patients (12%). Response to TKI therapy was similar for patients with CCA/Ph(-) and those without additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs). We further categorized CCA/Ph(-) into those in which -Y was the only clonal abnormality, and all others. We found that patients with non -Y CCA/Ph(-) had worse failure-free survival (FFS), event-free survival (EFS), transformation-free survival (TFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with those without ACAs with the following 5-year rates: FFS (52% vs 70%, P = .02), EFS (68% vs 86%, P = .02), TFS (76% vs 94%, P < .01), and OS (79% vs 94%, P = .03). In a multivariate analysis, non -Y CCA/Ph(-) increased the risk of transformation or death when baseline characteristics were considered with a hazard ratio of 2.81 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-6.89; P = .02). However, this prognostic impact was not statistically significant when achieving BCR-ABL <10% at 3 months was included in the analysis. In conclusion, non -Y CCA/Ph(-) are associated with decreased survival when emerging in patients with chronic-phase CML across various TKIs.

Co-occurrence of mutant NPM1 with FLT3-ITD carries a significantly worse prognosis than NPM1-RAS combinations. To understand the molecular basis of these observations, we compare the effects of the 2 combinations on hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis in knock-in mice. Early effects of these mutations on hematopoiesis show that compound Npm1(cA/+);Nras(G12D/+) or Npm1(cA);Flt3(ITD) share a number of features: Hox gene overexpression, enhanced self-renewal, expansion of hematopoietic progenitors, and myeloid differentiation bias. However, Npm1(cA);Flt3(ITD) mutants displayed significantly higher peripheral leukocyte counts, early depletion of common lymphoid progenitors, and a monocytic bias in comparison with the granulocytic bias in Npm1(cA/+);Nras(G12D/+) mutants. Underlying this was a striking molecular synergy manifested as a dramatically altered gene expression profile in Npm1(cA);Flt3(ITD) , but not Npm1(cA/+);Nras(G12D/+) , progenitors compared with wild-type. Both double-mutant models developed high-penetrance AML, although latency was significantly longer with Npm1(cA/+);Nras(G12D/+) During AML evolution, both models acquired additional copies of the mutant Flt3 or Nras alleles, but only Npm1(cA/+);Nras(G12D/+) mice showed acquisition of other human AML mutations, including IDH1 R132Q. We also find, using primary Cas9-expressing AMLs, that Hoxa genes and selected interactors or downstream targets are required for survival of both types of double-mutant AML. Our results show that molecular complementarity underlies the higher frequency and significantly worse prognosis associated with NPM1c/FLT3-ITD vs NPM1/NRAS-G12D-mutant AML and functionally confirm the role of HOXA genes in NPM1c-driven AML.","['Dovey, Oliver M', 'Cooper, Jonathan L', 'Mupo, Annalisa', 'Grove, Carolyn S', 'Lynn, Claire', 'Conte, Nathalie', 'Andrews, Robert M', 'Pacharne, Suruchi', 'Tzelepis, Konstantinos', 'Vijayabaskar, M S', 'Green, Paul', 'Rad, Roland', 'Arends, Mark', 'Wright, Penny', 'Yusa, Kosuke', 'Bradley, Allan', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Vassiliou, George S']","['Dovey OM', 'Cooper JL', 'Mupo A', 'Grove CS', 'Lynn C', 'Conte N', 'Andrews RM', 'Pacharne S', 'Tzelepis K', 'Vijayabaskar MS', 'Green P', 'Rad R', 'Arends M', 'Wright P', 'Yusa K', 'Bradley A', 'Varela I', 'Vassiliou GS']","['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Australia.', 'PathWest Division of Clinical Pathology, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Nedlands, Australia.', ""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Division of Cancer Studies, Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Sample Phenotype Ontology Team, European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Translation, Innovation, Methodology, and Engagement, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom; and.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NKX2-3 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",,,2017/08/25 06:00,2017/11/07 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32764-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-01-760595 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Oct 26;130(17):1911-1922. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-01-760595.

Although effective tumor eradication and excellent safety profile are well demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies, incomplete vascular shutdown and angiogenesis are known to cause tumor recurrence after vascular-targeted PDT. We have explored therapeutic enhancement of vascular-targeted PDT with PI3K signaling pathway inhibitors because the activation of PI3K pathway was involved in promoting endothelial cell survival and proliferation after PDT. Here, three clinically relevant small-molecule inhibitors (BYL719, BKM120, and BEZ235) of the PI3K pathway were evaluated in combination with verteporfin-PDT. Although all three inhibitors were able to synergistically enhance PDT response in endothelial cells, PDT combined with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 exhibited the strongest synergism, followed in order by combinations with pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and p110alpha isoform-selective inhibitor BYL719. Combination treatments of PDT and BEZ235 exhibited a cooperative inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 and induced more cell apoptosis than each treatment alone. In addition to increasing treatment lethality, BEZ235 combined with PDT effectively inhibited PI3K pathway activation and consequent endothelial cell proliferation after PDT alone, leading to a sustained growth inhibition.

Here, a high-throughput screen identified diosmetin, a citrus flavonoid, with anti-AML activity. Diosmetin imparted selective toxicity against leukemia and leukemia stem cells in vitro and in vivo with no effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that diosmetin targets estrogen receptor (ER) beta. ERbeta expression conferred cell sensitivity, as patient-derived AML cells with high levels of ERbeta were sensitive, whereas cells with low ERbeta were insensitive to diosmetin. Knockdown of ERbeta confirmed resistance, whereas overexpression enhanced sensitivity to diosmetin, which was demonstrated to be mediated by reactive oxygen species signaling. In summary, these studies highlight targeting of ERbeta with diosmetin as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(11); 2618-26.

Based on this premise, the metabolic phenotype of CLL lymphocytes was investigated by evaluating the two intracellular ATP-generating pathways. Metabolic flux was assessed by measuring glycolysis as extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and then correlated with prognostic factors. Further, the impact of B-cell receptor signaling (BCR) on metabolism was determined by genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibitors. Compared with proliferative B-cell lines, metabolic fluxes of oxygen and lactate were low in CLL cells. ECAR was consistently low, but OCR varied considerably in human patient samples (n = 45). Higher OCR was associated with poor prognostic factors such as ZAP 70 positivity, unmutated IGHV, high beta2M levels, and higher Rai stage. Consistent with the association of ZAP 70 and IGHV unmutated status with active BCR signaling, genetic ablation of BCR mitigated OCR in malignant B cells. Similarly, knocking out PI3Kdelta, a critical component of the BCR pathway, decreased OCR and ECAR. In concert, PI3K pathway inhibitors dramatically reduced OCR and ECAR. In harmony with a decline in metabolic activity, the ribonucleotide pools in CLL cells were reduced with duvelisib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate that CLL metabolism, especially OCR, is linked to prognostic factors and is curbed by BCR and PI3K pathway inhibition.Implications: This study identifies a relationship between oxidative phosphorylation in CLL and prognostic factors providing a rationale to therapeutically target these processes.

For older patients considered fit for intensive chemotherapy, standard induction therapy should be given, followed by consideration of reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients considered unfit for intensive therapy are standardly treated with hypomethylating agents.

Previously these suppressive cells were observed to expand in HIV patients and in a mouse retrovirus model, yet their suppressive effect on virus-specific CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo has not been characterized thus far. RESULTS: We used the Friend retrovirus (FV) model to demonstrate that MDSCs expand and become activated during the late phase of acute FV infection. Only the subpopulation of granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs) but not monocytic MDSC suppressed virus-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation and function in vitro. gMDSCs expressed arginase 1, high levels of the inhibitory ligand PD-L1 and the ATP dephosphorylating enzyme CD39 on the cell surface upon infection. All three molecules were involved in the suppressive effect of the gMDSCs in vitro. MDSC depletion experiments in FV-infected mice revealed that they restrict virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and thus affect the immune control of chronic retroviruses in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that MDSCs become activated and expand during the acute phase of retrovirus infection. Their suppressive activity on virus-specific CD8+ T cells may contribute to T cell dysfunction and the development of chronic infection.","['Drabczyk-Pluta, Malgorzata', 'Werner, Tanja', 'Hoffmann, Daniel', 'Leng, Qibin', 'Chen, Lieping', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy']","['Drabczyk-Pluta M', 'Werner T', 'Hoffmann D', 'Leng Q', 'Chen L', 'Dittmer U', 'Zelinskyy G']","['Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Research Group Bioinformatics, Faculty of Biology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany. gennadiy.zelinskyy@uni-due.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Granulocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Arginase', 'CD8+ T cells', 'Friend virus', 'MDSC', 'PD-L1']",2017/08/25 06:00,2018/09/06 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-017-0364-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-017-0364-3 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2017 Aug 23;14(1):42. doi: 10.1186/s12977-017-0364-3.,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6338-2382'],PMC5569525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is currently no information on the extent and predictors of HM at Kinshasa University Clinics (KUC), DR Congo (DRC). This study evaluated the impact of bio-clinical factors, exposure to polluted environments, and interactions between global climate changes (EL Nino and La Nina) and local climate (dry and rainy seasons) on the incidence of HM. METHODS: This hospital-based prospective cohort study was conducted at Kinshasa University Clinics in DR Congo. A total of 105 black African adult patients with anaemia between 2009 and 2016 were included. HM was confirmed by morphological typing according to the French-American-British (FAB) Classification System. Gender, age, exposure to traffic pollution and garages/stations, global climate variability (El Nino and La Nina), and local climate (dry and rainy seasons) were potential independent variables to predict incident HM using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan Meier curves. RESULTS: Out of the total 105 patients, 63 experienced incident HM, with an incidence rate of 60%. After adjusting for gender, HIV/AIDS, and other bio-clinical factors, the most significant independent predictors of HM were age >/= 55 years (HR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-4.3; P = 0.003), exposure to pollution and garages or stations (HR = 4.9; 95% CI 2-12.1; P < 0.001), combined local dry season + La Nina (HR = 4.6; 95%CI 1.8-11.8; P < 0.001), and combined local dry season + El Nino (HR = 4; 95% CI 1.6-9.7; P = 0.004). HM types included acute myeloid leukaemia (28.6% n = 18), multiple myeloma (22.2% n = 14), myelodysplastic syndromes (15.9% n = 10), chronic myeloid leukaemia (15.9% n = 10), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (9.5% n = 6), and acute lymphoid leukaemia (7.9% n = 5). After adjusting for confounders using Cox regression analysis, age >/= 55 years, exposure to pollution, combined local dry season + La Nina and combined local dry season + El Nino were the most significant predictors of incident hematologic malignancy. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of aging, pollution, the dry season, El Nino and La Nina as related to global warming as determinants of hematologic malignancies among African patients from Kinshasa, DR Congo.

Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase, and carbonic anhydrase (CA), and susceptibility to oxidation in RBCs, and pH in whole blood were measured at baseline and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Results MDA levels and susceptibility to oxidation were increased in all three groups time-dependently, but this increase was greater in the serotonin group than in the other groups. Activity of GSH-Px, CAT, and CA, as well as GSH levels, were decreased in the control and serotonin groups time-dependently, but were significantly preserved in the resveratrol group. The pH was decreased in all groups time-dependently. Conclusion Our study shows that resveratrol attenuates susceptibility to oxidation of RBCs and protects their antioxidant capacity, and partially preserves CA activity time-dependently.","['Huyut, Zubeyir', 'Sekeroglu, Mehmet Ramazan', 'Balahoroglu, Ragip', 'Huyut, Mehmet Tahir']","['Huyut Z', 'Sekeroglu MR', 'Balahoroglu R', 'Huyut MT']","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, 64162 Yuzuncu Yil University , Van, Turkey.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, 175678 Sakarya University , Sakarya, Turkey.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Region Research Hospital, Konya, Turkey.', '4 Department of Biostatistics, Medical Faculty, 64162 Yuzuncu Yil University , Van, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,England,J Int Med Res,The Journal of international medical research,0346411,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Citrates)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '51404-37-6 (citrate phosphate dextrose)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/metabolism', 'Catalase/blood', 'Citrates/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/blood', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/blood', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/blood', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Resveratrol', 'Serotonin/*pharmacology', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Antioxidants', 'chronic storage', 'oxidation', 'resveratrol', 'serotonin', 'storage lesions', 'stored RBCs']",2017/08/25 06:00,2018/08/02 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0300060517725450 [doi]'],ppublish,J Int Med Res. 2018 Jan;46(1):272-283. doi: 10.1177/0300060517725450.

Because these correlations could be influenced by confounding and/or misclassification among large geographic units, we reinvestigated them using smaller geographic units that better reflect exposure and disease at the individual level. METHODS: We examined the relationships between CLL and RR per county in 478 counties with publicly-available data. RESULTS: After adjustment for ultraviolet radiation, a possible risk factor for CLL, county rates for CLL and RR were significantly correlated among males and females both together and separately (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: CLL is significantly associated with RR at the county level.","['Oancea, S Cristina', 'Rundquist, Bradley C', 'Simon, Isaac', 'Swartz, Sami', 'Zheng, Yun', 'Zhou, Xudong', 'Sens, Mary Ann', 'Schwartz, Gary G']","['Oancea SC', 'Rundquist BC', 'Simon I', 'Swartz S', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhou X', 'Sens MA', 'Schwartz GG']","['Department of Population Health, School of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND 58202, USA.', 'Department of Geography & Geographic Information Science, University of North Dakota, College of Arts & Sciences, Grand Forks, ND 58202, USA.', 'Department of Earth System Science & Policy, University of North Dakota, John D.

Here, we designed CD44-targeted glutathione-sensitive hyaluronic acid-mercaptopurine prodrug (HA-GS-MP) linked via carbonyl vinyl sulfide for safer and enhanced treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HA-GS-MP obtained with 50 kDa HA and 6-MP conjugation content of 6.9 wt % showed excellent water solubility with a hydrodynamic size of ca. 15 nm. Intriguingly, HA-GS-MP was extremely stable, without any drug leakage, under physiological environment while rapidly releasing 6-MP in response to 10 mM glutathione. HA-GS-MP exhibited obvious targetability and markedly enhanced antitumor effect to OCI/AML-2 human AML cells (IC50 = 16.9 mug 6-MP equiv./mL). The pharmacokinetic studies displayed that Cy5-labeled HA-GS-MP had a long circulation time in mice (elimination half-life = 4.37 h). The in vivo fluorescence images demonstrated strong and persistent accumulation of Cy5-labeled HA-GS-MP from 4 to 48 h post injection in the subcutaneous OCI/AML-2 tumor in nude mice. Notably, HA-GS-MP while causing little side effects induced significantly enhanced growth inhibition of OCI/AML-2 tumor and better survival rate of OCI/AML-2 tumor-bearing mice as compared to free 6-MP. Carbonyl vinyl sulfide-linked hyaluronic acid-mercaptopurine prodrug has appeared to be a simple and smart nanomedicine for targeted treatment of AML.","['Qiu, Jie', 'Cheng, Ru', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Sun, Huanli', 'Deng, Chao', 'Meng, Fenghua', 'Zhong, Zhiyuan']","['Qiu J', 'Cheng R', 'Zhang J', 'Sun H', 'Deng C', 'Meng F', 'Zhong Z']","['Biomedical Polymers Laboratory, and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Advanced Functional Polymer Design and Application, College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Soochow University , Suzhou 215123, P.

The resulting data showed that BKM120 exerted a concentration-dependent growth suppressive effect; however, IC50 values varied among the tested cells. Our results outlined that the blockage of PI3K in NB4, as the most sensitive cell line, resulted in a caspase-3-dependent apoptosis probably through NFkappaB-mediated suppression of c-Myc and hTERT. As far we are aware, to date, there have been no reports of BKM120 effect on enzymatic repression of telomerase, and this study represents for the first time that the anti-proliferative effect of the inhibitor on NB4 is mediated by down-regulation of telomerase; shedding new light on the novel mechanism of action of BKM120.","['Bashash, Davood', 'Delshad, Mahda', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Safa, Majid', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Bashash D', 'Delshad M', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Safa M', 'Momeny M', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Malignant cells in AML often exhibit chromosomal and other genetic or epigenetic abnormalities that are useful in prognostic risk assessment. In this study, the relative expression and novel single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding function of purine-rich element binding proteins A and B (Puralpha and Purbeta) were systematically evaluated in established leukemia cell lines and in lineage committed myeloid cells isolated from patients diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy. Western blotting revealed that Puralpha and Purbeta are markedly elevated in CD33(+) /CD66b(+) cells from AML patients compared to healthy subjects and to patients with other types of myeloid cell disorders. Results of in silico database analysis of PURA and PURB mRNA expression during hematopoiesis in conjunction with the quantitative immunoassay of the ssDNA-binding activities of Puralpha and Purbeta in transformed leukocyte cell lines pointed to Purbeta as the more distinguishing biomarker of myeloid cell differentiation status. Purbeta ssDNA-binding activity was significantly increased in myeloid cells from AML patients but not from individuals with other myeloid-related diseases. The highest levels of Purbeta activity were detected in myeloid cells from primary AML patients and from AML patients displaying other risk factors forecasting a poor prognosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that the enhanced ssDNA-binding activity of Purbeta in transformed myeloid cells may serve as a unique and measurable phenotypic trait for improving prognostic risk stratification in AML.","['Kelm, Robert J Jr', 'Lamba, Gurpreet S', 'Levis, Jamie E', 'Holmes, Chris E']","['Kelm RJ Jr', 'Lamba GS', 'Levis JE', 'Holmes CE']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Vermont, Robert Larner, M.

One viable means of classification involves evaluation of the cell surface proteome of lymphoid malignancies. Specifically, this manuscript details the use of an antibody independent approach known as Cell Surface Capture Technology, to assess the N-glycoproteome of four human lymphocyte cell lines. Altogether, 404 cell surface N-glycoproteins were identified as markers for specific cell types involved in lymphocytic malignancies, including 82 N-glycoproteins that had not been previously been described for B or T cells within the Cell Surface Protein Atlas. Comparative analysis, hierarchical clustering techniques, and label-free quantitation were used to reveal proteins most informative for each cell type. Undoubtedly, the characterization of the cell surface proteome of lymphoid malignancies is a first step toward improving personalized diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.","['Haverland, Nicole A', 'Waas, Matthew', 'Ntai, Ioanna', 'Keppel, Theodore', 'Gundry, Rebekah L', 'Kelleher, Neil L']","['Haverland NA', 'Waas M', 'Ntai I', 'Keppel T', 'Gundry RL', 'Kelleher NL']","['Departments of Chemistry, Molecular Biosciences, and the Proteomics Center of Excellence, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Departments of Chemistry, Molecular Biosciences, and the Proteomics Center of Excellence, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Departments of Chemistry, Molecular Biosciences, and the Proteomics Center of Excellence, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['N-glycoproteins', 'cell surface proteins', 'plasma membrane']",2017/08/24 06:00,2018/02/16 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.201700156 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2017 Oct;17(19). doi: 10.1002/pmic.201700156.,"['R01 HL126785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL134010/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

METHODS: RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of Pim kinases, Tax, and intracellular signal molecules. Knockdown of Pim-3 and RelA was performed using small interfering RNA. The effects on cell proliferation, viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis were analyzed by WST-8, propidium iodide, and APO2.7 assay. NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: Pim-3 expression was restricted to HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Tax induced Pim-3 expression through NF-kappaB. Knockdown of Pim-3 showed growth inhibition of HTLV-1-infected T cells. NJC97-NH, a novel inhibitor of the Pim-1/3 kinases, inhibited cell viability. NJC97-NH induced G2/M cell cycle arrest associated with downregulation of cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression, as well as apoptosis accompanied with downregulation of XIAP and Mcl-1 expression through inhibition of NF-kappaB pathway, mediated through decrease in IkappaBalpha and RelA phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Pim-3 is a potentially suitable target for the development of novel therapeutic agents against ATL.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Hashimoto, Tadashi', 'Imaizumi, Atsushi', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Senba M', 'Hashimoto T', 'Imaizumi A', 'Mori N']","['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Transdisciplinary Research Organization for Subtropics and Island Studies, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Theravalues Corporation, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Theravalues Corporation, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170911,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'NF-kappaB', 'NJC97-NH', 'Pim-3', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1']",2017/08/24 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12940 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Dec;99(6):495-504. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12940.

Telomerase expression (hTERT), its activity and the telomere length are other important predictors of survival and multiple outcomes in CLL. SUV39H and SUV420H enzymes are histone methyltransferases (HMTases) involved in several cellular processes, including regulation of telomere length, heterochromatin organization, and genome stability. Here, we investigated whether SUV39H1, SUV39H2, SUV420H1, SUV420H2, and hTERT are associated with genomic instability of CLL. SUV39H (1/2), SUV420H (1/2), and hTERT expression was determined in 59 CLL samples by real time PCR. In addition, ZAP-70 protein expression was evaluated by Flow Cytometry and patients' karyotype was defined by Cytogenetic Analysis. Low expression of SUV39H1 was associated with the acquisition of altered and complex karyotypes. Conversely, high expression of SUV39H2 correlated with cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL patients. The pattern of karyotypic alterations differed in samples with detectable or undetectable hTERT expression. Furthermore, hTERT expression in CLL showed a correlation with transcript levels of SUV39H2, which, in part, can explain the association between SUV39H2 expression and cytogenetic abnormalities. Moreover, SUV39H1 correlated with SUV420H1 expression while SUV420H2 was associated with all other investigated HMTases. Our data show that the differential expression of SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 is associated with genomic instability and that the modulation of these HMTases can be an attractive approach to prevent CLL evolution.

To increase the specificity of the current score we systematically evaluated the diagnostic value of established as well as novel markers, such as CD200, in a large cohort of patients with untreated B-cell malignancies (n = 370). Double positivity for CD5 and CD23 was of very high value to differentiate between CLL and non-CLL cases. In addition, lack of FMC7 expression as well as CD79b expression intensity showed high sensitivity (90.4% and 92.3%) with acceptable specificity (74.4% and 76.9%). For surface IgM, low or absent expression displayed poor specificity in distinguishing CLL from non-CLL cases (51,3%; sensitivity 83,7%). Finally, CD200 positivity showed high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, CD5/CD23, FMC7, CD79b and CD200 were included in our new CLLflow score, which retained high sensitivity (97.1% vs. 98.6% for the Matutes score, P = 0.38), but showed markedly increased specificity (87.2% vs. 53.8%, P < 0.001). These results were confirmed in our validation cohort (sensitivity 97.0% vs. 100%, P = not applicable; specificity 86.4% vs. 59.1%, P = 0.03).

CASE REPORT: Here, we describe the case of a 61-year-old obese female with clinically diagnosed AML who presented a complex karyotype involving an uncommon abnormality: ring chromosome 11. Immunophenotypic analysis confirmed the diagnosis. Classical and molecular cytogenetic analyses, using GTG banding and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), revealed the presence of complex structural rearrangement involving r(11), add(12)(p13), der(5) and der(13).

Here, we provide novel evidence that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death in human leukemia cells. We found that 3OPTCA induces DNA fragmentation within 24 h after treatment in U937 cells, which was also observed in other leukemia cell lines, including Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. We then investigated other parameters involved in apoptosis, including phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 cleavage in U937 cells treated with 3OTPCA. 3OTPCA caused significant DNA fragmentation, annexin-V binding, and caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that 3OTPCA exerts cytotoxicity through apoptosis induction. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of transcripts associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), such as spliced XBP-1 and CHOP, were up-regulated by 3OTPCA treatment. 3OTPCA-induced UPR activation may be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress because both 3OTPCA and thapsigargin, an endoplasmic Ca2+ transport ATPase inhibitor, increased intracellular calcium levels. 3OTPCA down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, a target of CHOP, and led to the loss of the mitochondrial membrane, indicating that the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway was triggered by 3OTPCA, likely through UPR activation. Furthermore, we found that 3OTPCA induced superoxide anion generation and, following p38 MAPK phosphorylation, caspase-8 cleavage without affecting Fas expression. It also induced subsequent Bid cleavage, which may enhance the apoptosis triggered by the intrinsic pathway. These findings reveal for the first time that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of UPR.","['Mitsuhashi, Yohei', 'Furusawa, Yukihiro', 'Aradate, Tadashi', 'Zhao, Qing-Li', 'Moniruzzaman, Rohan', 'Kanamori, Masahiko', 'Noguchi, Kyo', 'Kondo, Takashi']","['Mitsuhashi Y', 'Furusawa Y', 'Aradate T', 'Zhao QL', 'Moniruzzaman R', 'Kanamori M', 'Noguchi K', 'Kondo T']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Toyama Prefectural University, Kurokawa, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Human Science 1, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (3-O-p-coumaroylalphitolic acid)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', '*Unfolded Protein Response', 'Ziziphus/*chemistry', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,,2017/08/24 06:00,2017/11/08 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0183712 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-12538 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Aug 23;12(8):e0183712. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0183712. eCollection 2017.,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6020-6965'],PMC5568338,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the striking in vivo anti-inflammatory potential, the underlying in vitro molecular mode of action remains elusive. To date, few studies have examined pseudopterosin effects on cancer cells. However, to our knowledge, no studies have explored their ability to block cytokine release in breast cancer cells and the respective bidirectional communication with associated immune cells. The present work demonstrates that pseudopterosins have the ability to block the key inflammatory signaling pathway nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p65 and IkappaB (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor) in leukemia and in breast cancer cells, respectively. Blockade of NF-kappaB leads to subsequent reduction of the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). Furthermore, pseudopterosin treatment reduces cytokine expression induced by conditioned media in both cell lines investigated. Interestingly, the presence of pseudopterosins induces a nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor. When knocking down the glucocorticoid receptor, the natural product loses the ability to block cytokine expression. Thus, we hypothesize that pseudopterosins inhibit NF-kappaB through activation of the glucocorticoid receptor in triple negative breast cancer.","['Sperlich, Julia', 'Kerr, Russell', 'Teusch, Nicole']","['Sperlich J', 'Kerr R', 'Teusch N']","['Bio-Pharmaceutical Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology, Faculty of Applied Natural Sciences, Technische Hochschule Koeln, Chempark, 51368 Leverkusen, Germany. julia.sperlich@th-koeln.de.', 'Department of Chemistry, and Department of Biomedical Sciences, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada. rkerr@upei.ca.', 'Bio-Pharmaceutical Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology, Faculty of Applied Natural Sciences, Technische Hochschule Koeln, Chempark, 51368 Leverkusen, Germany. nicole.teusch@th-koeln.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (pseudopterosins)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Biological Products/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glycosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Marine Biology', 'NF-kappa B/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['IL-6', 'MCP-1', 'NF-kappaB', 'TNFalpha', 'breast cancer', 'cytokine release', 'glucocorticoid receptor', 'inflammation', 'p65', 'pseudopterosin', 'tumor microenvironment']",2017/08/24 06:00,2018/05/02 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['md15090262 [pii]', '10.3390/md15090262 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2017 Aug 23;15(9). pii: md15090262. doi: 10.3390/md15090262.,,,,PMC5618401,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutant RHOA lacks GTP binding capacity, suggesting defects in the classical RHOA signaling. Here, we discovered the novel function of the G17V RHOA: VAV1 was identified as a G17V RHOA-specific binding partner via high-throughput screening. We found that binding of G17V RHOA to VAV1 augmented its adaptor function through phosphorylation of 174Tyr, resulting in acceleration of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Enrichment of cytokine and chemokine-related pathways was also evident by the expression of G17V RHOA. We further identified VAV1 mutations and a new translocation, VAV1-STAP2, in seven of the 85 RHOA mutation-negative samples (8.2%), whereas none of the 41 RHOA mutation-positive samples exhibited VAV1 mutations. Augmentation of 174Tyr phosphorylation was also demonstrated in VAV1-STAP2. Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, efficiently blocked the accelerated VAV1 phosphorylation and the associating TCR signaling by both G17V RHOA and VAV1-STAP2 expression. Phospho-VAV1 staining was demonstrated in the clinical specimens harboring G17V RHOA and VAV1 mutations at a higher frequency than those without.

Production of its bioconjugates can increase its half-life, stability and decrease its immunogenicity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to immobilize this drug on silica nanoparticles by two different cross-linking agents. METHOD: The drug was conjugated to nanoparticles by two cross-linking agents; 1-ethyl-3-(3- dimethylaminopropyl) carboiimide HCl (EDC) or glutaraldehyde. The effect of the drug to the nanoparticles ratio, the amount of cross-linking agents and the time of conjugation were optimized according to the zeta potential, size particle and the enzyme immobilization efficiency. Conjugation of L-asparaginase to nanoparticles was confirmed by FT-IR and TEM. The activity, kinetic profiles, stability against pH changes, thermal and storage stability of the native and immobilized drug were compared. RESULTS: The results showed significant increase in pH range of the stability and decrease in the km value of the drug after immobilization; indicating an increase in the enzyme tendency for the substrate. The Time of stability of the drug increased after immobilization in plasma and phosphate buffer saline which can increase its half-life of circulation. CONCLUSION: The activity and stability of immobilized drug by EDC were better than glutaraldehyde.","['Golestaneh, Dorsa', 'Varshosaz, Jaleh']","['Golestaneh D', 'Varshosaz J']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Recent Pat Nanotechnol,Recent patents on nanotechnology,101291922,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '0 (Propylamines)', '0 (Silanes)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'L8S6UBW552 (amino-propyl-triethoxysilane)', 'RJ5OZG6I4A (Ethyldimethylaminopropyl Carbodiimide)', 'T3C89M417N (Glutaral)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*metabolism', 'Buffers', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Enzymes, Immobilized/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Ethyldimethylaminopropyl Carbodiimide/chemistry', 'Glutaral/chemistry', 'Half-Life', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Particle Size', 'Patents as Topic', 'Plasma', 'Propylamines/chemistry', 'Silanes/chemistry', 'Silicon Dioxide/*chemistry', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Static Electricity', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Trypsin/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cross-linking agents', 'EDC', 'L-asparaginase', 'glutaraldehyde', 'immobilization', 'silica nanoparticles']",2017/08/24 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['NANOTEC-EPUB-85441 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867324666170823143634 [doi]']",ppublish,Recent Pat Nanotechnol. 2018 Feb 14;12(1):70-82. doi: 10.2174/0929867324666170823143634.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we described how miR-133 has anti-tumorigenic potential through repression of EVI1 expression. It has also been reported that miR-1 is oncogenic in the case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show that expression of miR-1 and miR-133, which have distinct functions, is differentially regulated between AML cell lines. Interestingly, the expression of miR-1 and EVI1, which binds to the promoter of the miR-1/miR-133 cluster, is correlative. The expression levels of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein that has been reported to increase the expression, but inhibits the activity, of miR-1, were not correlated with expression levels of miR-1 in AML cells. Taken together, our observations raise the possibility that the balance of polycistronic miRNAs is regulated post-transcriptionally in a hierarchical manner possibly involving EVI1, suggesting that the deregulation of this balance may play some role in AML cells with high EVI1 expression.","['Kotaki, Ryutaro', 'Higuchi, Hiroshi', 'Ogiya, Daisuke', 'Katahira, Yasuhiro', 'Kurosaki, Natsumi', 'Yukihira, Naoko', 'Ogata, Jun', 'Yamamoto, Haruna', 'Mohamad Alba, Syakira', 'Azhim, Azran', 'Kitajima, Tatsuo', 'Inoue, Shigeaki', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Ono, Koh', 'Koyama-Nasu, Ryo', 'Kotani, Ai']","['Kotaki R', 'Higuchi H', 'Ogiya D', 'Katahira Y', 'Kurosaki N', 'Yukihira N', 'Ogata J', 'Yamamoto H', 'Mohamad Alba S', 'Azhim A', 'Kitajima T', 'Inoue S', 'Morishita K', 'Ono K', 'Koyama-Nasu R', 'Kotani A']","['Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology, University of Technology Malaysia, 54100, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kulliyyah of Science, International Islamic University Malaysia, 25200, Kuantan, Malaysia.', 'Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology, University of Technology Malaysia, 54100, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan. ryonasu@tokai.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan. aikotani@k-lab.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan. aikotani@k-lab.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170822,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MIRN1 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN133 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TARDBP protein, human)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'EVI1', 'miR-1', 'miR-133']",2017/08/24 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2314-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2314-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Dec;106(6):811-819. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2314-1.

Traditional L(2) microlenses are almost two-dimensional (2D) due to the modulation of flow rates in planer chips. Fundamental difficulties in effective application to cell imaging and analysis arise due to the limitations of 2D profiles. Herein, we demonstrate the feasible design of three-dimensional (3D) L(2) biconvex lenses to detect flowing cells. Using the auxiliary curved microchannels, a 3D L(2) lens is formed using Dean flow. The shape of the 3D biconvex lens and its focal length can be modulated by tuning the flow rates of the liquids. 3D light focusing was successfully achieved and the focal length could be modulated by around 435 mum, from 3554 mum to 3989 mum, in the experiment. The numerical aperture of the 3D L(2) lens was also measured and its range was 0.175-0.198. Compared to a traditional objective lens with the same magnification (4x/0.1), the resolution of the 3D L(2) biconvex lenses was improved 1.79-fold due to being completely immersed in liquid. Mouse myeloma cells sp2/0 and acute promyelocytic leukemia cells NB4 were imaged in the contrast experiments. The time response of experimental manipulation was about 2.7 ms. This 3D biconvex lens has great application prospects for cell imaging and analysis systems in lab-on-a-chip settings.","['Liang, L', 'Zhu, X Q', 'Liu, H L', 'Shi, Y', 'Yang, Y']","['Liang L', 'Zhu XQ', 'Liu HL', 'Shi Y', 'Yang Y']","['School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Equipment Design', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', '*Lenses', 'Mice', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Refractometry']",,,2017/08/24 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c7lc00598a [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2017 Sep 26;17(19):3258-3263. doi: 10.1039/c7lc00598a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although As2O3 is also applied to treat other types of cancer in vitro and in vivo, it has been reported that single agent As2O3 has poor efficacy against non-hematologic malignant cancers in clinical trials. Recently, a few reports have indicated that organic arsenic compounds can be a possible alternative for the treatment of As2O3-resistant cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the organic arsenic compound phenylarsine oxide (PAO) has potent cytotoxic effects against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells. Our results showed that PAO not only had a potent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HepG2 cells but also activated apoptosis-related proteins (e.g., caspase-3 and -9 and poly-ADP ribose polymerase) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, intracellular ROS were specifically accumulated in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after exposure to PAO, implying that they are the target organelles for PAO-induced cytotoxicity. Additionally, when the cells were pretreated with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), apoptosis and ER-stress were attenuated significantly, suggesting that induction of apoptosis and cell death probably occurs through the ROS-mediated mitochondria and ER-stress dependent signaling pathways.","['Huang, Ping', 'Zhang, Yu Hua', 'Zheng, Xiao Wei', 'Liu, Yu Jia', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Fang, Luo', 'Zhang, Yi Wen', 'Yang, Chang', 'Islam, Khairul', 'Wang, Chao', 'Naranmandura, Hua']","['Huang P', 'Zhang YH', 'Zheng XW', 'Liu YJ', 'Zhang H', 'Fang L', 'Zhang YW', 'Yang C', 'Islam K', 'Wang C', 'Naranmandura H']","['Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, 310022, China.', ""Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, 310022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, 310022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, 310022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, 310022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, 310022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China and Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China and Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170823,England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2017/08/24 06:00,2018/06/26 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c7mt00179g [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2017 Dec 1;9(12):1756-1764. doi: 10.1039/c7mt00179g.

To facilitate the clinical cancer research, we proposed a network-based strategy to identify the cancer-related miRNAs and to predict their targeted genes based on the gene expression profiles. The strategy was validated by using the data sets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). The results showed that in the top 20 miRNAs ranked by their degrees, 90.0% (18/20), 70.0% (14/20), and 70.0% (14/20) miRNAs were found to be associated with the cancers for AML, BRCA, and KIRC, respectively. The KEGG pathways and GO terms enriched with the genes that were predicted as the targets of the cancer-related miRNAs were significantly associated with the biological processes of cancers. In addition, several genes, which were predicted to be regulated by more than three miRNAs, were identified to be the potential drug targets annotated by using the human protein atlas database. Our results demonstrated that the proposed strategy can be helpful for predicting the miRNA-mRNA interactions in tumorigenesis and identifying the cancer-related miRNAs as the potential drug targets.","['Xue, Jiwei', 'Xie, Fanfan', 'Xu, Junmei', 'Liu, Yuan', 'Liang, Yu', 'Wen, Zhining', 'Li, Menglong']","['Xue J', 'Xie F', 'Xu J', 'Liu Y', 'Liang Y', 'Wen Z', 'Li M']","['College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,Int J Genomics,International journal of genomics,101605206,,,,,,2017/08/24 06:00,2017/08/24 06:01,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/3538568 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Genomics. 2017;2017:3538568. doi: 10.1155/2017/3538568.

BBT594 and CHZ868, Type-II inhibitors of JAK2, illustrate satisfactory efficacy in preclinical MPNs and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) models. However, the L884P mutation of JAK2 abrogates the suppressive effects of BBT594 and CHZ868. In this study, conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, umbrella sampling (US) simulations and MM/GBSA free energy calculations were employed to explore how the L884P mutation affects the binding of BBT594 and CHZ868 to JAK2 and uncover the resistance mechanism induced by the L884P mutation. The results provided by the US and MD simulations illustrate that the L884P mutation enhances the flexibility of the allosteric pocket and alters their conformations, which amplify the conformational entropy change (-TDeltaS) and weaken the interactions between the inhibitors and target. Additionally, the structural analyses of BBT594 and CHZ868 in complex with the WT JAK2 illustrate that the drug tail with strong electronegativity and small size located in the allosteric pocket of JAK2 may enhance anti-resistance capability. In summary, our results highlight that both of the changes of the conformational entropies and enthalpies contribute to the L884P-induced resistance in the binding of two Type-II inhibitors into JAK2 kinase.","['Kong, Xiaotian', 'Sun, Huiyong', 'Pan, Peichen', 'Li, Dan', 'Zhu, Feng', 'Chang, Shan', 'Xu, Lei', 'Li, Youyong', 'Hou, Tingjun']","['Kong X', 'Sun H', 'Pan P', 'Li D', 'Zhu F', 'Chang S', 'Xu L', 'Li Y', 'Hou T']","['Institute of Functional Nano and Soft Materials (FUNSOM), Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215123, P.

In this phase 2 study, we investigated the effect of vaccination with dendritic cells (DCs) electroporated with Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) messenger RNA (mRNA) as postremission treatment in 30 patients with AML at very high risk of relapse. There was a demonstrable antileukemic response in 13 patients. Nine patients achieved molecular remission as demonstrated by normalization of WT1 transcript levels, 5 of which were sustained after a median follow-up of 109.4 months. Disease stabilization was achieved in 4 other patients. Five-year overall survival (OS) was higher in responders than in nonresponders (53.8% vs 25.0%; P = .01). In patients receiving DCs in first complete remission (CR1), there was a vaccine-induced relapse reduction rate of 25%, and 5-year relapse-free survival was higher in responders than in nonresponders (50% vs 7.7%; P < .0001). In patients age </=65 and >65 years who received DCs in CR1, 5-year OS was 69.2% and 30.8% respectively, as compared with 51.7% and 18% in the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry. Long-term clinical response was correlated with increased circulating frequencies of polyepitope WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells. Long-term OS was correlated with interferon-gamma(+) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(+) WT1-specific responses in delayed-type hypersensitivity-infiltrating CD8(+) T lymphocytes. In conclusion, vaccination of patients with AML with WT1 mRNA-electroporated DCs can be an effective strategy to prevent or delay relapse after standard chemotherapy, translating into improved OS rates, which are correlated with the induction of WT1-specific CD8(+) T-cell response.

The epigenetic modulation of CD20 coding gene (MS4A1) has been proposed as a mechanism for the reduced therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD20 antibodies and confirmed with nonselective histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Because the use of pan-HDACis is associated with substantial adverse effects, the identification of particular HDAC isoforms involved in CD20 regulation seems to be of paramount importance. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the role of HDAC6 in the regulation of CD20 levels. We show that inhibition of HDAC6 activity significantly increases CD20 levels in established B-cell tumor cell lines and primary malignant cells. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we confirm that HDAC6 inhibition augments in vitro efficacy of anti-CD20 mAbs and improves survival of mice treated with rituximab. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HDAC6 influences synthesis of CD20 protein independently of the regulation of MS4A1 transcription. We further demonstrate that translation of CD20 mRNA is significantly enhanced after HDAC6 inhibition, as shown by the increase of CD20 mRNA within the polysomal fraction, indicating a new role of HDAC6 in the posttranscriptional mechanism of CD20 regulation. Collectively, our findings suggest HDAC6 inhibition is a rational therapeutic strategy to be implemented in combination therapies with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and open up novel avenues for the clinical use of HDAC6 inhibitors.","['Bobrowicz, Malgorzata', 'Dwojak, Michal', 'Pyrzynska, Beata', 'Stachura, Joanna', 'Muchowicz, Angelika', 'Berthel, Elise', 'Dalla-Venezia, Nicole', 'Kozikowski, Mieszko', 'Siernicka, Marta', 'Miazek, Nina', 'Zapala, Piotr', 'Domagala, Antoni', 'Bojarczuk, Kamil', 'Malenda, Agata', 'Barankiewicz, Joanna', 'Graczyk-Jarzynka, Agnieszka', 'Zagozdzon, Agnieszka', 'Gabrysiak, Magdalena', 'Diaz, Jean-Jacques', 'Karp, Marta', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Firczuk, Malgorzata', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Baatout, Dunja', 'Frenzel, Lukas', 'Malinowska, Agata', 'Slabicki, Mikolaj', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Zerrouqi, Abdessamad', 'Golab, Jakub', 'Winiarska, Magdalena']","['Bobrowicz M', 'Dwojak M', 'Pyrzynska B', 'Stachura J', 'Muchowicz A', 'Berthel E', 'Dalla-Venezia N', 'Kozikowski M', 'Siernicka M', 'Miazek N', 'Zapala P', 'Domagala A', 'Bojarczuk K', 'Malenda A', 'Barankiewicz J', 'Graczyk-Jarzynka A', 'Zagozdzon A', 'Gabrysiak M', 'Diaz JJ', 'Karp M', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Firczuk M', 'Giannopoulos K', 'Efremov DG', 'Laurenti L', 'Baatout D', 'Frenzel L', 'Malinowska A', 'Slabicki M', 'Zenz T', 'Zerrouqi A', 'Golab J', 'Winiarska M']","['Department of Immunology and.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Centre Leon Berard, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, INSERM U1052, CNRS, UMR5286, Lyon, France.', 'Centre Leon Berard, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, INSERM U1052, CNRS, UMR5286, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Urology, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, European Health Centre, Otwock, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Centre Leon Berard, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, INSERM U1052, CNRS, UMR5286, Lyon, France.', ""Department of Hematology, St John's Cancer Center in Lublin, Poland."", 'Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology and.', ""Department of Hematology, St John's Cancer Center in Lublin, Poland."", 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University Hospital ""A.

Several studies have suggested that CCG-1423 interacts not only with MKL1, which has a critical role in the regulation of neuronal morphology, but also with phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (Phactr1), which is localized at synapses. However, the effect of CCG-1423 on neuronal cells, especially on neuronal morphology, remains to be determined. In this study, we focused on the effect of CCG-1423 on axonal elongation, dendritic length, dendritic complexity and dendritic spine morphology. Incubation of cortical neuron cultures with up to 10 muM CCG-1423 for 72 h did not significantly affect cell viability. CCG-1423 inhibited axonal elongation and blocked the increase of dendritic length and complexity, but did not affect dendritic spine morphology. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that CCG-1423 affects neurite elongation, except for dendritic spines, without affecting neuronal cell viability. This study provides a better understanding of the effects of CCG-1423 on neurons, which may be useful for the assessment of the potential clinical application of CCG-1423 and its derivatives.","['Kikuchi, Keietsu', 'Shiota, Jun', 'Yamada, Tetsuya', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Ihara, Daisuke', 'Fukuchi, Mamoru', 'Tsuda, Masaaki', 'Tabuchi, Akiko']","['Kikuchi K', 'Shiota J', 'Yamada T', 'Ishikawa M', 'Ihara D', 'Fukuchi M', 'Tsuda M', 'Tabuchi A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan; Department of Physiology, Keio University, School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan; Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Faculty of Pharmacy, Takasaki University of Health and Welfare, 60 Nakaorui-machi, Takasaki-shi, Gunma 370-0033, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.

In this article, we report an extremely rare occurrence of acute promyelocytic leukemia in a patient with CLL. A 71-year-old man first presented to our clinic with a diagnosis of CLL and worsening motor neuropathy symptoms. It was suspected that his CLL might be contributing to the neuropathy as a paraneoplastic syndrome, and he was treated with rituximab monotherapy in weekly doses for the 1st month and monthly treatments thereafter. By the end of his sixth monthly course of rituximab, the patient noted significant improvement in neuropathy symptoms but reported experiencing a new-onset worsening fatigue. He had new-onset cytopenias (white blood cells 1.6k/microL, hemoglobin 11.7g/dL, and platelet count 77k/microL). A bone marrow examination was performed; it showed a high percentage of progranulocytes (21%), which stained positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and demonstrated a fine granular pattern on the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) oncogenic domain immunofluorescence test. The diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, which showed a PML/RARalpha rearrangement in 46% of interphases. Flow cytometry was consistent with immunophenotype of acute promyelocytic leukemia and minimal residual CLL (0.07%). The patient was started promptly on all-trans-retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide induction regimen. Molecular remission was achieved after the first consolidation cycle. The patient is currently past his fourth consolidation cycle of all-trans-retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide and continues to be in complete remission. Our case illustrates that it is important for the physicians to be aware of coexistent hematologic and solid tumor malignancies in CLL, and maintain a low threshold for diagnostic testing based on grounds of low clinical suspicion.","['Boddu, Prajwal', 'Schlette, Ellen', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Tang, Guillin', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Wierda, William', 'Jain, Nitin']","['Boddu P', 'Schlette E', 'Thakral B', 'Tang G', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Kadia T', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Ravandi F', 'Wierda W', 'Jain N']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.

During T-ALL, patients are at risk of organ infiltration by leukemic T-cells. Infiltration is a major consequence of disease relapse and correlates with poor prognosis. Transendothelial migration of leukemic cells is required to exit the blood stream into target organs. While mechanisms of normal T-cell transmigration are well known, the mechanisms of leukemic T-cell extravasation remain elusive; but involvement of chemokines, integrins and Notch signaling play critical roles. Here, we summarize current knowledge about molecular mechanisms of leukemic T-cell infiltration with special emphasis on the newly identified subtype early T-cell-progenitor (ETP)-ALL. Furthermore, we compare the extravasation potential of T-ALL cells with that of other hematologic malignancies such as B-ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","['Vadillo, Eduardo', 'Dorantes-Acosta, Elisa', 'Pelayo, Rosana', 'Schnoor, Michael']","['Vadillo E', 'Dorantes-Acosta E', 'Pelayo R', 'Schnoor M']","['Department for Molecular Biomedicine, Centre for Investigation and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav-IPN), 07360 Mexico City, Mexico.

This study investigated whether quantifying mean fluorescence intensity of four monoclonal antibodies in a flow cytometry panel is useful for the differential diagnosis and characterization of these disorders. METHODS: The expressions of CD52, CD200, CD123 and CD43 were analyzed in samples from 124 patients with mature B-cell neoplasms. The quantitative estimation of these antigens was assessed by mean fluorescence intensity. RESULTS: The cases included were 78 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, three atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemias, six marginal zone lymphomas, 11 splenic marginal zone lymphomas, nine lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, six mantle cell lymphomas, two hairy cell leukemias, two hairy cell leukemias variant, five follicular lymphomas, one Burkitt lymphoma and one diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The mean fluorescence intensity of CD200 was higher in atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia cases. CD123 showed higher mean fluorescence intensities in hairy cell leukemia cells. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma had higher expression of CD43 and all follicular lymphoma cases had very low mean fluorescence intensity values.

Aberrant miRNA expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The objective of this study was to compare miRNA expression profiles of patients with Binet A chronic lymphocytic leukemia with those of subjects with high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and healthy volunteers (controls). METHODS: Twenty-one chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, 12 subjects with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Flow cytometry CD19(+)CD5(+)-based cell sorting was performed for the chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis groups and CD19(+) cells were sorted to analyze the control group. The expressions of miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-181a, miR-181b and miR-155) were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Significant differences between the expressions in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis groups were restricted to the expression of miR-155, which was higher in the former group. A comparison between healthy controls and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis/chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients revealed higher miR-155 and miR-34a levels and lower miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-181a and miR-181b in the latter group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a progressive increase of miR-155 expression from controls to monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis to chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The role of miR-155 in the development of overt chronic lymphocytic leukemia in individuals with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis must be further analyzed.","['Furtado, Felipe Magalhaes', 'Scheucher, Priscila Santos', 'Santana, Barbara Amelia', 'Zanette, Dalila Luciola', 'Calado, Rodrigo do Tocantins', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Matos, Daniel Mazza', 'Falcao, Roberto Passetto']","['Furtado FM', 'Scheucher PS', 'Santana BA', 'Zanette DL', 'Calado RDT', 'Rego EM', 'Matos DM', 'Falcao RP']","['Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto (FMRP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the response to imatinib mesylate treatment (400mg/day) in Brazilian patients in the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia monitored by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. METHODS: Between October 2002 and October 2010, 3169 peripheral blood samples were collected from 1403 patients from 3 to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, 12 to 17 months, 18 to 23 months and >/=24 months after beginning imatinib treatment. Eighty-two patients had samples available and analyzed for all time intervals. BCR-ABL1 quantification was performed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction using the ABL1 gene as the control. Results of the BCR-ABL1 ratio as a percentage were reported by the international scale (IS) using the laboratory conversion factor (0.51). RESULTS: In the first interval, 80.8% of patients achieved the optimal response (BCR-ABL1(IS)</=10%). In the second period, 69.1% achieved optimal response (BCR-ABL1(IS)</=1%) and, between 12 and 17 months, 47.3% achieved major molecular response (BCR-ABL1(IS)</=0.1%).

A cross-sectional study.,202-209,S1516-8484(17)30002-6 [pii] 10.1016/j.bjhh.2016.11.006 [doi],"BACKGROUND: l-Asparaginase is essential in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. If immunoglobulin G anti-l-asparaginase antibodies develop, they can lead to faster plasma clearance and reduced efficiency as well as to hypersensitivity reactions, in which immunoglobulin E can also participate. This study investigated the presence of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin E anti-l-asparaginase antibodies and their clinical associations. METHODS: Under 16-year-old patients at diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia confirmed by flow cytometry and treated with a uniform l-asparaginase and chemotherapy protocol were studied. Immunoglobulin G anti-l-asparaginase antibodies were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intradermal and prick skin testing was performed to establish the presence of specific immunoglobulin E anti-l-asparaginase antibodies in vivo. Statistical analysis was used to investigate associations of these antibodies with relevant clinical events and outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-one children were studied with 42 (82.35%) having anti-l-asparaginase antibodies. In this group immunoglobulin G antibodies alone were documented in 10 (23.8%) compared to immunoglobulin E alone in 18 (42.8%) patients. Immunoglobulin G together with immunoglobulin E were simultaneously present in 14 patients. Children who produced exclusively immunoglobulin G or no antibodies had a lower event-free survival (p-value=0.024). Eighteen children (35.3%) relapsed with five of nine of this group who had negative skin tests suffering additional relapses (range: 2-4), compared to none of the nine children who relapsed who had positive skin tests (p-value<0.001). CONCLUSION: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and isolated immunoglobulin G anti-l-asparaginase antibodies had a higher relapse rate, whereas no additional relapses developed in children with immunoglobulin E anti-l-asparaginase antibodies after the first relapse.","['Galindo-Rodriguez, Gabriela', 'Jaime-Perez, Jose C', 'Salinas-Carmona, Mario C', 'Gonzalez-Diaz, Sandra N', 'Castro-Corona, Angeles', 'Cavazos-Gonzalez, Raul', 'Trevino-Villarreal, Humberto', 'Heredia-Salazar, Alberto C', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Galindo-Rodriguez G', 'Jaime-Perez JC', 'Salinas-Carmona MC', 'Gonzalez-Diaz SN', 'Castro-Corona A', 'Cavazos-Gonzalez R', 'Trevino-Villarreal H', 'Heredia-Salazar AC', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.

Combination immunochemotherapy, such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), is now standard first-line therapy. However, the majority of patients relapse and require further therapy, and so new, effective, targeted therapies that improve remission rates, reduce relapses, and have fewer side effects, are required. The FLAIR trial will assess whether ibrutinib plus rituximab (IR) is superior to FCR in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). METHODS/DESIGN: FLAIR is a phase III, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open, parallel-group trial in patients with previously untreated CLL. A total of 754 participants will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive standard therapy with FCR or IR. Participants randomised to FCR will receive a maximum of six 28-day treatment cycles. Participants randomised to IR will receive six 28-day cycles of rituximab, and ibrutinib taken daily for 6 years until minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity has been recorded for the same amount of time as it took to become MRD negative, or until disease progression. The primary endpoint is PFS according to the International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) criteria. Secondary endpoints include: overall survival; proportion of participants with undetectable MRD; response to therapy by IWCLL criteria; safety and toxicity; health-related quality of life (QoL); and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: The trial aims to provide evidence for the future first-line treatment of CLL patients by assessing whether IR is superior to FCR in terms of PFS, and whether toxicity rates are favourable.

It is believed that the expression level of the key genes is associated with the treatment outcome of AML. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the clinical features and molecular aberrations of 560 newly diagnosed non-M3 AML patients, including mutational status of CEBPA, NPM1, FLT3, C-KIT, NRAS, WT1, DNMT3A, MLL-PTD and IDH1/2, as well as expression levels of MECOM, ERG, GATA2, WT1, BAALC, MEIS1 and SPI1. RESULTS: Certain gene expression levels were associated with the cytogenetic aberration of the disease, especially for MECOM, MEIS1 and BAALC. FLT3, C-KIT and NRAS mutations contained conversed expression profile regarding MEIS1, WT1, GATA2 and BAALC expression, respectively. FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA represented the mutations associated with the prognosis of AML in our group. Higher MECOM and MEIS1 gene expression levels showed a significant impact on complete remission (CR) rate, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) both in univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively; and an additive effect could be observed. By systematically integrating gene mutational status results and gene expression profile, we could establish a more refined system to precisely subdivide AML patients into distinct prognostic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression abnormalities contained important biological and clinical informations, and could be integrated into current AML stratification system.","['Zhu, Yong-Mei', 'Wang, Pan-Pan', 'Huang, Jin-Yan', 'Chen, Yun-Shuo', 'Chen, Bing', 'Dai, Yu-Jun', 'Yan, Han', 'Hu, Yi', 'Cheng, Wen-Yan', 'Ma, Ting-Ting', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Shen, Yang']","['Zhu YM', 'Wang PP', 'Huang JY', 'Chen YS', 'Chen B', 'Dai YJ', 'Yan H', 'Hu Y', 'Cheng WY', 'Ma TT', 'Chen SJ', 'Shen Y']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China. sjchen@stn.sh.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 RuiJin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, China. shen_yang@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170822,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Gene expression', '*Mutation', '*Prognosis']",2017/08/24 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-017-1279-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-017-1279-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2017 Aug 22;15(1):178. doi: 10.1186/s12967-017-1279-4.,,,,PMC5568401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current ultrasonography technology lacks the capacity to determine efficiently the endometrial receptivity during ongoing cycle transfers. We analyzed the relationship between the gene expression profile associated with implantation and clinical pregnancy from endometrial cells taken during embryo transfer. METHODS: Seventy-six patients submitted to a standard ovarian stimulation protocol, in vitro fertilization, and good quality embryos were collected (morphological assessment). Endometrial samples were taken with ultrasonography guidance and cells were Hematoxylin and Eosin stained for morphological identification. Total RNA was extracted and the expression of Mucin 1 (MUC1), Homeobox A10 (HOXA-10), Leukemia Inhibitor Factor (LIF), Colony Stimulating Factor-1 (CSF-1), and ribosomal 18 s (endogenous control) were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Presence of a gestational sac, beta-hGC (>/=10 mIU/mL on Day 20), and a fetal heartbeat were used to determine a positive embryo implantation and pregnancy. RESULTS: Samples collected from same cycle embryo transfer showed clear morphological staining for endometrial cells (80-90% of the cells). Cells in the sample were molecularly identified as the endometrium (HOXA-10 positive and MUC-1 negative). CSF-1 expression was 4.55-fold and LIF expression was 12.25-fold higher in patients who became pregnant. Both increases were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide evidence of a new method to assess endometrial receptivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression profile, based on LIF and CSF-1, showed a difference between a receptive and a non-receptive endometrium.","['Camargo-Diaz, Felipe', 'Garcia, Valeria', 'Ocampo-Barcenas, Azucena', 'Gonzalez-Marquez, Humberto', 'Lopez-Bayghen, Esther']","['Camargo-Diaz F', 'Garcia V', 'Ocampo-Barcenas A', 'Gonzalez-Marquez H', 'Lopez-Bayghen E']","['Laboratorio de Investigacion y Diagnostico Molecular, Instituto de Infertilidad y Genetica SC, INGENES, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biologicas y de la Salud, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Iztapalapa, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion y Diagnostico Molecular, Instituto de Infertilidad y Genetica SC, INGENES, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion y Diagnostico Molecular, Instituto de Infertilidad y Genetica SC, INGENES, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biologicas y de la Salud, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Iztapalapa, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion y Diagnostico Molecular, Instituto de Infertilidad y Genetica SC, INGENES, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biologicas y de la Salud, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Iztapalapa, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Toxicologia, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Mexico City, CDMX, Mexico. ebayghen@cinvestav.mx.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170822,England,BMC Womens Health,BMC women's health,101088690,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Embryo Implantation', 'Embryo Transfer/methods', 'Endometrium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Ovulation Induction/*methods', 'Pregnancy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CSF', '*Endometrial receptivity', '*HOXA10', '*LIF']",2017/08/24 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12905-017-0418-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12905-017-0418-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Womens Health. 2017 Aug 22;17(1):63. doi: 10.1186/s12905-017-0418-7.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2849-7587'],PMC5567912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSCs self-renew, proliferate, and differentiate into mature progeny under the control of local microenvironments including hematopoietic niche, which can deliver regulatory signals in the form of bound or secreted molecules and from physical cues such as oxygen tension and shear stress. Among these mediators, accumulating evidence indicates the potential involvement of several chemokines, particularly CXCL12, in the interaction between HSCs and bone marrow microenvironments. Fusion between breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ABL)-1 gene gives rise to BCR-ABL protein with a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and transforms HSCs and/or hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) into disease-propagating leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). LSCs can self-renew, proliferate, and differentiate under the influence of the signals delivered by bone marrow microenvironments including niche, as HSCs can. Thus, the interaction with bone marrow microenvironments is indispensable for the initiation, maintenance, and progression of CML. Moreover, the crosstalk between LSCs and bone marrow microenvironments can contribute to some instances of therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, evidence is accumulating to indicate the important roles of bone marrow microenvironment-derived chemokines. Hence, we will herein discuss the roles of chemokines in CML with a focus on bone marrow microenvironments.","['Mukaida, Naofumi', 'Tanabe, Yamato', 'Baba, Tomohisa']","['Mukaida N', 'Tanabe Y', 'Baba T']","['Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kakuma-machi, Ishikawa, Kanazawa 920-1192, Japan. mukaida@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kakuma-machi, Ishikawa, Kanazawa 920-1192, Japan. t.yamato@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kakuma-machi, Ishikawa, Kanazawa 920-1192, Japan. sergenti@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170822,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['CCL3', 'CXCL12', 'CXCR4', 'hematopoietic progenitor cell', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'leukemia stem cell', 'niche']",2017/08/23 06:00,2018/05/04 06:00,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18081824 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18081824 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Aug 22;18(8). pii: ijms18081824. doi: 10.3390/ijms18081824.,,,,PMC5578209,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a therapeutic strategy, BCR-ABL inhibitors have been clinically approved which terminates its phosphorylation activity and retards cancer progression. However, a number of patients develop resistance to inhibitors which demand for the discovery of new inhibitors. Given the drawbacks of present inhibitors, by high throughput virtual screening approaches, present study pursues to identify high affinity compounds targeting BCR-ABL1 anticipated to have safer pharmacological profiles. Five established BCR-ABL inhibitors formed the query compounds for identification of structurally similar compounds by Tanimoto coefficient based linear fingerprint search with a threshold of 95% against PubChemdatabase. Assisted by MolDock algorithm all compounds were docked against BCR-ABL protein in order to retrieve high affinity compounds. The parents and similars were further tested for their ADMET propertiesand bioactivity. Rebastinib formed higher affinity inhibitor than rest of the four established compound investigated in the study. Interestingly, Rebastinib similar compound with Pubchem ID: 67254402 was also shown to have highest affinity than other similars including the similars of respective five parents. In terms of ADMET properties Pubchem ID: 67254402 had appreciable ADMET profile and bioactivity. However, Rebastinib still stood as the best inhibitor in terms of binding affinity and ADMET properties than Pubchem ID: 67254402. Nevertheless, owing to the similar pharmacological properties with Rebastinib, Pubchem ID: 67254402 can be expected to form potential BCR-ABL inhibitor.","['Sharda, Saphy', 'Sarmandal, Palash', 'Cherukommu, Shirisha', 'Dindhoria, Kiran', 'Yadav, Manisha', 'Bandaru, Srinivas', 'Sharma, Anudeep', 'Sakhi, Aditi', 'Vyas, Tanmay', 'Hussain, Tajamul', 'Nayarisseri, Anuraj', 'Singh, Sanjeev Kumar']","['Sharda S', 'Sarmandal P', 'Cherukommu S', 'Dindhoria K', 'Yadav M', 'Bandaru S', 'Sharma A', 'Sakhi A', 'Vyas T', 'Hussain T', 'Nayarisseri A', 'Singh SK']","['In silico Research Laboratory, Eminent Biosciences, Indore - 452 010, Madhya Pradesh.

Areas covered: Several aggressive gonadotoxic regimens such as alkylating chemotherapy and total body irradiation are used frequently in treatment of lymphoma and leukemia leading to subsequent iatrogenic premature ovarian failure and fertility loss. In such cases, female fertility preservation options should be offered in advance. Expert commentary: In order to preserve fertility of young women and girls with lymphoma and leukemia, several established, experimental, and debatable options can be offered before starting chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, each of those female fertility preservation options has both advantages and disadvantages and may not be suitable for all patients. That is why a fertility preservation strategy should be individualized and tailored distinctively for each patient in order to be effective. Artificial human ovary is a novel experimental in vitro technology to produce mature oocytes that could be the safest option to preserve and restore fertility of young women and girls with hematological malignancies especially when other fertility preservation options are not feasible or contraindicated. Further research and studies are needed to improve the results of artificial human ovary and establish it in clinical practice.","['Salama, Mahmoud', 'Isachenko, Vladimir', 'Isachenko, Evgenia', 'Rahimi, Gohar', 'Mallmann, Peter']","['Salama M', 'Isachenko V', 'Isachenko E', 'Rahimi G', 'Mallmann P']","['a Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical Faculty , University of Cologne , Cologne , Germany.', 'a Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical Faculty , University of Cologne , Cologne , Germany.', 'a Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical Faculty , University of Cologne , Cologne , Germany.', 'a Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical Faculty , University of Cologne , Cologne , Germany.', 'a Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical Faculty , University of Cologne , Cologne , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170828,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Female', 'Fertility Preservation/*methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematological malignancies', '*artificial ovary', '*fertility preservation', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*oncofertility']",2017/08/23 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1371009 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Nov;10(11):951-960. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1371009.

This study has evaluated the effects of IL-27 rs153109 and rs17855750 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) development, as well as their impact on prognosis and patient survival. A total of 200 patients and 210 healthy subjects were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. We observed a higher frequency of rs153109 AG and rs17855750 TG genotypes and allele G in patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). Combined G variant genotypes (AG + GG and TG + GG) also conferred significantly greater risk of ALL. There was a significant correlation between the genotypes of both SNPs with event-free survival (EFS). Patients with GG genotypes of both SNPs and those of rs153109 AG and rs17855750 TG had a shorter EFS than patients with rs153109 AA and rs17855750 TT genotypes (p </= 0.035). Combined G variant genotypes for both SNPs showed poorer response to therapy in all patients (p < 0.027) as well as B-ALL (rs153109, p < 0.001) and T-ALL (rs153109, p = 0.048) patients. In multivariate analysis, rs153109 combined G variant genotype was associated with shorter EFS (relative risk = 9.7, p = 0.026). Among those who relapsed, 87.1% had the rs153109 AG genotype and 77.4% had the rs17855750 TG genotype (p < 0.01). Patients had higher IL-27 serum levels compared to controls, but this did not differ between genotypes. In conclusion, the association of IL-27 rs153109 and rs17855750 polymorphisms with risk of ALL development and their impact on EFS suggested an important role for this cytokine in biology and response to ALL therapy.","['Ghavami, Alireza', 'Fathpour, Gholamreza', 'Amirghofran, Zahra']","['Ghavami A', 'Fathpour G', 'Amirghofran Z']","['Department of Immunology and Autoimmune Diseases Research Center, Medical School, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, 71345-1798, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology Oncology Branch, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology and Autoimmune Diseases Research Center, Medical School, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, 71345-1798, Iran. amirghz@sums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170821,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MYDGF protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukins/*genetics', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Interleukin-27', 'Polymorphism']",2017/08/23 06:00,2018/10/27 06:00,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-017-0295-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-017-0295-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2018 Jul;24(3):653-662. doi: 10.1007/s12253-017-0295-2.

We aimed to compare outcomes of hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy and intensive chemotherapy (IC) in elderly AML patients and identify the subgroup of patients who are eligible for HMA therapy. We reviewed data on the outcomes of 86 AML patients aged >/= 65 years, who had undergone treatment between 2010 and 2015. These treatments included IC (25 patients, 29.1%) or therapy using HMA including azacitidine or decitabine (61 patients, 70.9%). The overall response rates were 32 and 19.7%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) (8 vs. 8 months) and progression-free survival (PFS) (6 vs. 7 months) durations were similar in the two groups. Patients in the HMA group with less than 10% peripheral blood (PB) blasts achieved significantly better OS duration than patients in the IC group (P = 0.043). Patients in the IC group with PB blasts and bone marrow blast of >/= 10 and >/= 50%, respectively, achieved better PFS durations than the corresponding patients in the HMA group (P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis identified the hematologic improvement-platelet (HI-P) as an independent prognostic factor for survival in the HMA group (P = 0.005). Our results showed that HMA therapy and IC were associated with similar survival duration in elderly AML patients. This study was noteworthy because it assessed prognostic factors that would help to select elderly patients who could expect actual benefits from undergoing the different therapeutic options available, especially HMA therapy.","['Oh, Sang-Bo', 'Park, Sung-Woo', 'Chung, Joo-Seop', 'Lee, Won-Sik', 'Lee, Ho-Seop', 'Cho, Su-Hee', 'Choi, Yoon-Suk', 'Lim, Sung-Nam', 'Shin, Ho-Jin']","['Oh SB', 'Park SW', 'Chung JS', 'Lee WS', 'Lee HS', 'Cho SH', 'Choi YS', 'Lim SN', 'Shin HJ']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Busan Paik Hospital, Busan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Busan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, Ulsan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Busan Haeundae Paik Hospital, Busan, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan, South Korea. hojinja@hanmail.net.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170821,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Decision-Making/*methods', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Elderly patients', 'Hypomethylating agent', 'Intensive chemotherapy', 'Therapeutic decision-making']",2017/08/23 06:00,2017/10/28 06:00,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3104-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3104-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Nov;96(11):1801-1809. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3104-9.

It was previously thought that angiogenesis plays no role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), due to the fact that AML is a liquid tumor. However, many studies have suggested that increased angiogenesis has important roles in patients with AML, including increased numbers of vessels in bone marrow and pro-angiogenic factors, as well as decreased anti-angiogenic factors. Also a large number of studies demonstrated that a two-way communication is established between leukemic and endothelial cells, as a component of the vessel wall, in the bone marrow of patients with AML. These two cells support the survival and proliferation of each other through a paracrine pathway, resulting in resistance to chemotherapy. In addition, It is well-established that increased angiogenesis is associated with unfavorable prognosis, lower survival rate, resistance to chemotherapy, and relapse. Furthermore, increased angiogenesis affects the response to treatment, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcome and graft versus host disease (GVHD) occurrence. In this regard, this review will address vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang), two of the most important angiogenic factors, in patients with AML before and after HSCT. By increasing our understanding of the role of endothelial cells and angiogenic factors in patients with AML from diagnosis to post-HSCT, new therapeutic strategies can be developed to reduce angiogenesis, improve patients' survival and reduce complications.","['Mohammadi Najafabadi, M', 'Shamsasenjan, K', 'Akbarzadehalaleh, P']","['Mohammadi Najafabadi M', 'Shamsasenjan K', 'Akbarzadehalaleh P']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170501,Iran,Int J Organ Transplant Med,International journal of organ transplantation medicine,101535773,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis inducing agents', 'Endothelial cells', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Leukemia', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor A', 'acute', 'myeloid']",2017/08/23 06:00,2017/08/23 06:01,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Organ Transplant Med. 2017;8(2):57-67.

We have addressed here the challenge to deliver into cancer cells phosphorylated gemcitabine drugs well known for their instability and inability to permeate cell membranes. NMR data corroborated by semiempirical theoretical calculations have shown that aminoalkyl-CDs form sufficiently stable complexes with both mono- and tri-phosphate forms of gemcitabine by simple mixing of the compounds in aqueous solution at physiological pH. Confocal microscopy and radioactivity counting experiments revealed that the developed systems enabled phosphorylated gemcitabine to penetrate efficiently into aggressive human breast cancer cells (MCF7), eventually leading to a substantial reduction of IC50 values. Moreover, compared to free drugs, phosphorylated metabolites of gemcitabine encapsulated in PCCDs displayed improved in vitro activities also on the aggressive human cancer cells CCRF-CEM Ara-C/8 C, a nucleoside transport-deficient T leukemia cell line. The current study offers the proof-of-principle that phosphorylated nucleoside drugs could be efficiently transported by PCCDs into cancer cells.","['Rodriguez-Ruiz, Violeta', 'Maksimenko, Andrey', 'Salzano, Giuseppina', 'Lampropoulou, Maria', 'Lazarou, Yannis G', 'Agostoni, Valentina', 'Couvreur, Patrick', 'Gref, Ruxandra', 'Yannakopoulou, Konstantina']","['Rodriguez-Ruiz V', 'Maksimenko A', 'Salzano G', 'Lampropoulou M', 'Lazarou YG', 'Agostoni V', 'Couvreur P', 'Gref R', 'Yannakopoulou K']","['Institut Galien (UMR CNRS 8612), Universite Paris-Sud, Universite Paris-Saclay, Chatenay-Malabry, France.', 'Universite de Cergy Pontoise, ERRMECe, Biomaterials for Health group, I MAT, F-95302, Cergy, Pontoise, France.', 'Institut Galien (UMR CNRS 8612), Universite Paris-Sud, Universite Paris-Saclay, Chatenay-Malabry, France.', 'UMR CNRS 8200, Gustave Roussy, DNA repair group, F-94051, Villejuif, France.', ""Institut des Sciences Moleculaires d'Orsay (UMR CNRS 8214), Universite Paris-Sud, Universite Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France."", 'National Center for Scientific Research ""Demokritos"", Institute of Nanoscience & Nanotechnology, Ag.

Preincubation of human T-cells (HLA-DR4(-)CD4(+)) with aPC prior to transplantation into humanized (NSG-AB degrees DR4) mice ameliorates graft-vs.-host disease. The protective effect of aPC on GvHD does not compromise the graft vs. leukaemia effect in two independent tumor cell models. Ex vivo preincubation of T-cells with aPC, aPC-based therapies, or targeting PAR2/PAR3 on T-cells may provide a safe and effective approach to mitigate GvHD.Graft-vs.-host disease is a complication of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Here the authors show that activated protein C signals via PAR2/PAR3 to expand Treg cells, mitigating the disease in mice.","['Ranjan, Satish', 'Goihl, Alexander', 'Kohli, Shrey', 'Gadi, Ihsan',

We generated mice missing Bcor exon 4, expressing a variant BCOR lacking the BCL6-binding domain. Although the deletion of exon 4 in male mice (Bcor(DeltaE4/y) ) compromised the repopulating capacity of hematopoietic stem cells, Bcor(DeltaE4/y) thymocytes had augmented proliferative capacity in culture and showed a strong propensity to induce acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), mostly in a Notch-dependent manner. Myc, one of the critical NOTCH1 targets in T-ALL, was highly up-regulated in Bcor(DeltaE4/y) T-ALL cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation/DNA sequencing analysis revealed that BCOR was recruited to the Myc promoter and restrained its activation in thymocytes. BCOR also targeted other NOTCH1 targets and potentially antagonized their transcriptional activation. Bcl6-deficient thymocytes behaved in a manner similar to Bcor(DeltaE4/y) thymocytes. Our results provide the first evidence of a tumor suppressor role for BCOR in the pathogenesis of T lymphocyte malignancies.","['Tanaka, Tomoyuki', 'Nakajima-Takagi, Yaeko', 'Aoyama, Kazumasa', 'Tara, Shiro', 'Oshima, Motohiko', 'Saraya, Atsunori', 'Koide, Shuhei', 'Si, Sha', 'Manabe, Ichiro', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Nakayama, Manabu', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Sone, Hirohito', 'Koseki, Haruhiko', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Tanaka T', 'Nakajima-Takagi Y', 'Aoyama K', 'Tara S', 'Oshima M', 'Saraya A', 'Koide S', 'Si S', 'Manabe I', 'Sanada M', 'Nakayama M', 'Masuko M', 'Sone H', 'Koseki H', 'Iwama A']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Biology and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnosis, Clinical Research Center, Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Chromosome Engineering Team, Department of Technology Development, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Developmental Genetics, RIKEN Research Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan aiwama@faculty.chiba-u.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170821,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Bcor protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Exons', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Thymocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",,,2017/08/23 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20170167 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20170167 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2017 Oct 2;214(10):2901-2913. doi: 10.1084/jem.20170167.

However, some patients ultimately relapse with loss of CD19 antigen on leukemic cells, which has been established as a novel mechanism to escape CD19-specific immunotherapies. Here, we provide evidence that CD19-negative (CD19(-)) relapse after CD19-directed therapy in BCP-ALL may be a result of the selection of preexisting CD19(-) malignant progenitor cells. We present 2 BCR-ABL1 fusion-positive BCP-ALL patients with CD19(-) myeloid lineage relapse after blinatumomab therapy and show BCR-ABL1 positivity in their hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)/progenitor/myeloid compartments at initial diagnosis by fluorescence in situ hybridization after cell sorting. By using the same approach with 25 additional diagnostic samples from patients with BCR-ABL1-positive BCP-ALL, we identified HSC involvement in 40% of the patients. Patients (6 of 8) with major BCR-ABL1 transcript encoding P210(BCR-ABL1) mainly showed HSC involvement, whereas in most of the patients (9 of 12) with minor BCR-ABL1 transcript encoding P190(BCR-ABL1), only the CD19(+) leukemia compartments were BCR-ABL1 positive (P = .02). Our data are of clinical importance, because they indicate that both CD19(+) cells and CD19(-) precursors should be targeted to avoid CD19(-) relapses in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL.","['Nagel, Inga', 'Bartels, Marius', 'Duell, Johannes', 'Oberg, Hans-Heinrich', 'Ussat, Sandra', 'Bruckmueller, Henrike', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Trautmann, Heiko', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Caliebe, Almuth', 'Kabelitz, Dieter', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Horst, Heinz-August', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Topp, Max S', 'Cascorbi, Ingolf', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Bruggemann, Monika']","['Nagel I', 'Bartels M', 'Duell J', 'Oberg HH', 'Ussat S', 'Bruckmueller H', 'Ottmann O', 'Pfeifer H', 'Trautmann H', 'Gokbuget N', 'Caliebe A', 'Kabelitz D', 'Kneba M', 'Horst HA', 'Hoelzer D', 'Topp MS', 'Cascorbi I', 'Siebert R', 'Bruggemann M']","['Institute of Human Genetics and.', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Universitatsklinikum, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom; and.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics and.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Universitatsklinikum, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics and.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital of Ulm and Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170821,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,,2017/08/23 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32752-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-05-782888 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Nov 2;130(18):2027-2031. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-782888.

Whereas the functions of Cic have been well characterized in Drosophila, little is known about its role in mammals. CIC is inactivated in a variety of human tumors and has been implicated recently in the promotion of lung metastases. Here, we describe a mouse model in which we inactivated Cic by selectively disabling its DNA-binding activity, a mutation that causes derepression of its target genes. Germline Cic inactivation causes perinatal lethality due to lung differentiation defects. However, its systemic inactivation in adult mice induces T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL), a tumor type known to carry CIC mutations, albeit with low incidence. Cic inactivation in mice induces T-ALL by a mechanism involving derepression of its well-known target, Etv4 Importantly, human T-ALL also relies on ETV4 expression for maintaining its oncogenic phenotype. Moreover, Cic inactivation renders T-ALL insensitive to MEK inhibitors in both mouse and human cell lines. Finally, we show that Ras-induced mouse T-ALL as well as human T-ALL carrying mutations in the RAS/MAPK pathway display a genetic signature indicative of Cic inactivation. These observations illustrate that CIC inactivation plays a key role in this human malignancy.","['Simon-Carrasco, Lucia', 'Grana, Osvaldo', 'Salmon, Marina', 'Jacob, Harrys K C', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Jimenez, Gerardo', 'Drosten, Matthias', 'Barbacid, Mariano']","['Simon-Carrasco L', 'Grana O', 'Salmon M', 'Jacob HKC', 'Gutierrez A', 'Jimenez G', 'Drosten M', 'Barbacid M']","['Molecular Oncology Programme, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programme, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Programme, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Programme, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."", 'Institut de Biologia Molecular de Barcelona-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Parc Cientific de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Programme, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Programme, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170821,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Cic protein, mouse)', '0 (ETV4 protein, human)', '0 (Etv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/metabolism', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Embryonic Development/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Oligodendroglioma/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CIC', '*Etv4', '*Ras signaling', '*T-ALL', '*mouse models']",2017/08/23 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['gad.300244.117 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.300244.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2017 Jul 15;31(14):1456-1468. doi: 10.1101/gad.300244.117.

Hallmarked by ineffective hematopoiesis, dysplastic marrow, and risk of transformation to acute leukemia, MDS remains a poorly treated disease. Although identification of hematopoietic aberrations in human MDS has contributed significantly to our understanding of MDS pathogenesis, evidence now identify the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) as another key contributor to disease initiation and progression. With improved understanding of the BMME, we are beginning to refine the role of the hematopoietic niche in MDS. Despite genetic diversity in MDS, interaction between MDS and the BMME appears to be a common disease feature and therefore represents an appealing therapeutic target. Further understanding of the interdependent relationship between MDS and its niche is needed to delineate the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic failure and how the microenvironment can be targeted clinically. This review provides an overview of data from human MDS and murine models supporting a role for BMME dysfunction at several steps of disease pathogenesis. Although no models or human studies so far have combined all of these findings, we review current data identifying BMME involvement in each step of MDS pathogenesis organized to reflect the chronology of BMME contribution as the normal hematopoietic system becomes myelodysplastic and MDS progresses to marrow failure and transformation. Although microenvironmental heterogeneity and dysfunction certainly add complexity to this syndrome, data are already demonstrating that targeting microenvironmental signals may represent novel therapeutic strategies for MDS treatment.","['Li, Allison J', 'Calvi, Laura M']","['Li AJ', 'Calvi LM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY.

TET2 catalyzes the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, leading to DNA demethylation, and also affects transcription by recruiting histone modifiers. Inactivating TET2 mutations cause epigenetic dysregulation, clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dominance, and monocytic lineage skewing. Here, we found that Tet2 was the most highly expressed Tet enzyme in murine macrophage (MPhi) differentiation. Tet2 transcription was further induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not interleukin (IL)-4, stimulation, potentially in a nuclear factor kappabeta-dependent manner. Tet2 loss did not affect early LPS gene responses in vitro, but increased Il-1b, Il-6, and Arginase 1 (Arg1) mRNA expression at later stages of stimulation in bone-marrow-derived MPhis (BMMPhis). Tet2-deficient peritoneal MPhis, however, demonstrated profound, constitutive expression of LPS-induced genes associated with an inflammatory state in vivo. In contrast, Tet2 deficiency did not affect alternative MPhi gene expression significantly in response to IL-4. These results suggested impaired resolution of inflammation in the absence of Tet2 both in vitro and in vivo. For the first time, we also detected TET2 mutations in BMMPhis from MDS and CMML patients and assayed their effects on LPS responses, including their potential influence on human IL-6 expression. Our results show that Tet2 restrains inflammation in murine MPhis and mice, raising the possibility that loss of TET2 function in MPhis may alter the immune environment in the large elderly population with TET2-mutant CHIP and in TET2-mutant myeloid cancer patients.","['Cull, Alyssa H', 'Snetsinger, Brooke', 'Buckstein, Rena', 'Wells, Richard A', 'Rauh, Michael J']","['Cull AH', 'Snetsinger B', 'Buckstein R', 'Wells RA', 'Rauh MJ']","[""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", 'Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

Novel targeted agents such as ibrutinib, venetoclax, and idelalisib have had a significant effect on first-line, relapsed/refractory, and high-risk disease. Despite these advances, there are continuous needs for new treatment options, especially for patients in whom these novel therapies fail or those who cannot tolerate these novel therapies. In 2011, Porter et al reported the first successful use of autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs) directed against cluster of differentiation (CD)19 in 3 refractory CLL patients. Several groups have since shown success with similar approaches in various settings of CLL, including failure of ibrutinib treatment and in patients who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although CD19-directed CART therapy holds great promise in CLL and other diseases, many challenges and questions remain including: optimization of the lymphodepletion regimen before CART infusion, optimal dosing of CART, a determination of the most effective CART product (T-cell subset[s]) as well as the optimal combinations and therapeutic sequences, and managing treatment-associated adverse events. Clinical trials addressing these challenges are in process. In this timely review, we analyze current state of CART therapy in CLL and attempt answering remaining questions.","['Mato, Anthony R', 'Thompson, Meghan C', 'Nabhan, Chadi', 'Svoboda, Jakub', 'Schuster, Stephen J']","['Mato AR', 'Thompson MC', 'Nabhan C', 'Svoboda J', 'Schuster SJ']","['Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

In this work, P450-catalyzed C-H hydroxylation of positions C9 and C14 in PTL was coupled to carbamoylation chemistry to yield a panel of novel carbamate-based PTL analogs ('parthenologs'). These compounds, along with a series of other C9- and C14-functionalized parthenologs obtained via O-H acylation, alkylation, and metal-catalyzed carbene insertion, were profiled for their cytotoxicity against a diverse panel of human cancer cell lines. These studies led to the discovery of several parthenologs with significantly improved anticancer activity (2-14-fold) compared to the parent molecule. Most interestingly, two PTL analogs with high cytotoxicity (LC50 approximately 1-3muM) against T cell leukemia (Jurkat), mantle cell lymphoma (JeKo-1), and adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells as well as a carbamate derivative with potent activity (LC50=0.6muM) against neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-MC) were obtained. In addition, these analyses resulted in the identification of parthenologs featuring both a broad spectrum and tumor cell-specific anticancer activity profile, thus providing valuable probes for the future investigation of biomolecular targets that can affect cell viability across multiple as well as specific types of human cancers. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of P450-mediated chemoenzymatic C-H functionalization toward tuning and improving the anticancer activity of the natural product parthenolide.","['Alwaseem, Hanan', 'Frisch, Benjamin J', 'Fasan, Rudi']","['Alwaseem H', 'Frisch BJ', 'Fasan R']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, United States.', 'Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology Division, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, United States.

The objective of this research was to collect information on the acute health effects and serious psychological symptoms of the possible consequences of such exposure to crude oil. Some studies focused on the composition of different chemicals used in the extraction process, and wastes generated proved to be highly harmful to human health. Thus, studies have shown that individuals who live near oil fields or wells - or who take part in activities of cleaning oil spills - have presented health conditions, such as irritation to the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, kidney damage, liver, reproductive, among others. In Ecuador, this reality is not different from other countries, and some studies have shown increased diseases related with oil crude and oil spills, like skin irritation, throat, liver, lung, infertility, and abortions, and it has been linked to childhood leukemia. Other studies suggest a direct relationship between DNA damage because of oil resulting in a genetic instability of the main enzymes of cellular metabolism as well as a relationship with some cancers, such as leukemia.","['Ramirez, Maria Isabel', 'Arevalo, Ana Paulina', 'Sotomayor, Santiago', 'Bailon-Moscoso, Natalia']","['Ramirez MI', 'Arevalo AP', 'Sotomayor S', 'Bailon-Moscoso N']","['Departamento de Ciencias de La Salud, Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja, San Cayetano Alto, Loja, 11-01-608, Ecuador.

Here we describe a metabolomics method for the analysis of rare cell populations isolated directly from tissues and use it to compare mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to restricted haematopoietic progenitors. Each haematopoietic cell type had a distinct metabolic signature. Human and mouse HSCs had unusually high levels of ascorbate, which decreased with differentiation. Systemic ascorbate depletion in mice increased HSC frequency and function, in part by reducing the function of Tet2, a dioxygenase tumour suppressor. Ascorbate depletion cooperated with Flt3 internal tandem duplication (Flt3(ITD)) leukaemic mutations to accelerate leukaemogenesis, through cell-autonomous and possibly non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, in a manner that was reversed by dietary ascorbate. Ascorbate acted cell-autonomously to negatively regulate HSC function and myelopoiesis through Tet2-dependent and Tet2-independent mechanisms. Ascorbate therefore accumulates within HSCs to promote Tet activity in vivo, limiting HSC frequency and suppressing leukaemogenesis.","['Agathocleous, Michalis', 'Meacham, Corbin E', 'Burgess, Rebecca J', 'Piskounova, Elena', 'Zhao, Zhiyu', 'Crane, Genevieve M', 'Cowin, Brianna L', 'Bruner, Emily', 'Murphy, Malea M', 'Chen, Weina', 'Spangrude, Gerald J', 'Hu, Zeping', 'DeBerardinis, Ralph J', 'Morrison, Sean J']","['Agathocleous M', 'Meacham CE', 'Burgess RJ', 'Piskounova E', 'Zhao Z', 'Crane GM', 'Cowin BL', 'Bruner E', 'Murphy MM', 'Chen W', 'Spangrude GJ', 'Hu Z', 'DeBerardinis RJ', 'Morrison SJ']","[""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.', ""Children's Research Institute and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."", 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170821,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/analysis/*metabolism', 'Ascorbic Acid Deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Metabolomics', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/08/22 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['nature23876 [pii]', '10.1038/nature23876 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2017 Sep 28;549(7673):476-481. doi: 10.1038/nature23876.

In this work, we have optimized droplet digital PCR to broadly measure mutated alleles of recurrently mutated genes in CR marrows of AML patients at levels as low as 0.002% variant allele frequency. Most gene mutations persisted in CR, albeit at highly variable and gene-dependent levels. The majority of AML cases demonstrated residual aberrant oligoclonal hematopoiesis. Importantly, we detected very rare cells (as few as 1 in 15,000) that were genomically similar to the dominant blast populations at diagnosis and were fully clonally represented at relapse, identifying these rare cells as one common source of AML relapse. Clinically, the mutant allele burden was associated with overall survival in AML, and our findings narrow the repertoire of gene mutations useful in minimal residual disease-based prognostication in AML. Overall, this work delineates rare cell populations that cause AML relapse, with direct implications for AML research directions and strategies to improve AML therapies and outcome.","['Parkin, Brian', 'Londono-Joshi, Angelina', 'Kang, Qing', 'Tewari, Muneesh', 'Rhim, Andrew D', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Parkin B', 'Londono-Joshi A', 'Kang Q', 'Tewari M', 'Rhim AD', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering.', 'Biointerfaces Institute, and.', 'Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170821,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/08/22 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2016/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['91964 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI91964 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 Sep 1;127(9):3484-3495. doi: 10.1172/JCI91964.

It has been approved for the indication of Ph chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but has also been tested in ALL with minimal residual disease, relapsed Ph/BCR-ABL positive ALL, relapsed ALL in pediatric patients and relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Adverse events have been mainly related to infection and hematological toxicities, as well as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Areas covered: The review will discuss mechanisms of action, published literature on efficacy in ALL and NHL, specific aspects of administration, frequent adverse events and practical management. Expert opinion: Blinatumomab represents an effective new treatment for highly resistant relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. Practical handling bears challenges due to application as four week continous infusion and specific adverse effects which can be well handled by experienced centers. Most promising outcomes are reported for patients with resistant disease but lower tumor load such as MRD positive ALL patients. Future studies will focus on the use of blinatumomab during first-line therapy and the role of stem cell transplantation after blinatumomab treatment.","['Wilke, Anne C', 'Gokbuget, Nicola']","['Wilke AC', 'Gokbuget N']","['a University Hospital , Department of Medicine II , Frankfurt , Germany.', 'a University Hospital , Department of Medicine II , Frankfurt , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170820,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CD19', 'antibody', 'immunotherapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'relapse']",2017/08/22 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14740338.2017.1338270 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2017 Oct;16(10):1191-1202. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2017.1338270.

Immunotherapy could open a new window of great interest in this setting. Natural killer (NK) cells constitute an important area of research for hematologic malignancies, because this subpopulation is able to kill target cells spontaneously without previous sensitization, representing a novel tool in the treatment of them. Abnormal NK cytolytic function is observed in several hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. Several mechanisms are involved in this abnormal function, such as decreased expression of activating receptors, increased expression of inhibitory receptors or defective expression of NK cell ligands on target cells. New immunotherapies are focused in identifying factors that could increase the expression of these activating receptors, to counteract inhibitory receptors expression, and therefore, to improve the NK cell cytotoxic capacities against tumor cells. In this work, we analyze the effect of interleukin (IL)-15 on the expression of NK cell-activating receptors that play a crucial role in the lysis of blasts from AML patients. Our results showed that IL-15 increased the surface expression of NKp30 on NK cells from healthy donors and AML patients with the consequent improvement of NK cell cytotoxicity. Besides, the upregulation of NKp30 induced by IL-15 is associated with an improvement of NK-mediated myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) maturation. NK cells cultured with IL-15 showed an upregulation of NKp30, which is associated with an increase anti-tumor activity and with an improved maturation of immature DCs. In our in vitro model, IL-15 exerted a great activating stimulus that could be used as novel immunotherapy in AML patients.","['Sanchez-Correa, Beatriz', 'Bergua, Juan M', 'Pera, Alejandra', 'Campos, Carmen', 'Arcos, Maria Jose', 'Banas, Helena', 'Duran, Esther', 'Solana, Rafael', 'Tarazona, Raquel']","['Sanchez-Correa B', 'Bergua JM', 'Pera A', 'Campos C', 'Arcos MJ', 'Banas H', 'Duran E', 'Solana R', 'Tarazona R']","['Immunology Unit, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofia University Hospital, University of Cordoba, Red Espanola de Investigacion en Patologia Infecciosa (REIPI), Cordoba, Spain.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom.', 'Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofia University Hospital, University of Cordoba, Red Espanola de Investigacion en Patologia Infecciosa (REIPI), Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Histology and Pathology Unit, Faculty of Veterinary, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.', 'Immunology Unit, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.', 'Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba (IMIBIC), Reina Sofia University Hospital, University of Cordoba, Red Espanola de Investigacion en Patologia Infecciosa (REIPI), Cordoba, Spain.', 'Immunology Unit, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170807,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NKp30', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'dendritic cells', 'interleukin-15', 'natural killer cell', 'natural killer cell degranulation']",2017/08/22 06:00,2017/08/22 06:01,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2017/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00931 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Aug 7;8:931. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00931. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5545593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In follicular lymphoma (FL), N-linked glycosylation sites are introduced in the immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region genes. Oligosaccharides added to the acquired sites are unusually of the high-mannose type. These glycans interact with mannose-specific lectins, especially with dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN). Lectin binding to FL triggers persistent activating signals, suggesting that lectins within the tumor microenvironment promote cell survival and proliferation. Insertion of N-glycosylation sites in Ig variable region genes has been detected in other germinal center-associated lymphomas, specifically in subsets of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and Burkitt's lymphomas, suggesting involvement of altered glycans in pathogenesis of these malignancies as well. Furthermore, the BCR in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) carries high-mannose oligosaccharides, albeit in the heavy chain constant rather than variable region. The high expression level of the unique glycoform, particularly in the more aggressive unmutated CLL subset, suggests a functional significance for this glycan in CLL. As lectin interaction with the BCR is critical for FL and probably for some other lymphomas, targeting this interaction is considered to be an interesting therapeutic strategy. Reagents for blockade of lectin-BCR interaction may include antibodies against high-mannose glycans and mannose-based oligosaccharide mimics or non-carbohydrate glycomimetics. Moreover, as this interaction triggers signaling pathways similar to those demonstrated for BCR engagement by antigen, BCR signal transduction inhibitors may emerge as effective therapeutics for lectin-driven malignancies.","['Hollander, Nurit', 'Haimovich, Joseph']","['Hollander N', 'Haimovich J']","['Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170802,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell antigen receptor', 'B-cell malignancies', 'high-mannose glycans', 'immunoglobulin', 'lectins']",2017/08/22 06:00,2017/08/22 06:01,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00912 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Aug 2;8:912. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00912. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5539419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 causes fatal T-cell leukemia (adult T cell leukemia) and a progressive myelopahy (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis, HAM/TSP) and other disorders. Since the discovery of HTLV-1, several other microorganisms are demonstrated to cause cancer in humans. In this article, we investigated the oncogenic capacity of HTLV-1, in comparison with those of other oncoviruses and one oncobacterium (Helicobacter pylori, H. Pylori) based on published literature. We conclude here that HTLV-1 is one of the most and may be the most carcinogenic among them and arguably one of the most potent of the known human carcinogens.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-known rehabilitation modality that has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects after cerebral ischemic injury. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS against post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and investigated the mechanisms underlying its effects in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. The results showed that rTMS ameliorated cognitive deficits and tended to reduce the sizes of cerebral lesions. In addition, rTMS significantly improved cognitive function via a mechanism involving increased neurogenesis and decreased apoptosis in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Moreover, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), were clearly upregulated in ischemic hippocampi after treatment with rTMS. Additionally, further studies demonstrated that rTMS markedly enhanced the expression of the apoptosis-related B cell lymphoma/leukemia gene 2 (Bcl-2) and decreased the expression of the Bcl-2-associated protein X (Bax) and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic hippocampus. Both protein levels and mRNA levels were investigated. Our findings suggest that after ischemic stroke, treatment with rTMS promoted the functional recovery of cognitive impairments by inhibiting apoptosis and enhancing neurogenesis in the hippocampus and that this mechanism might be mediated by the BDNF signaling pathway.","['Guo, Feng', 'Lou, Jicheng', 'Han, Xiaohua', 'Deng, Yuguo', 'Huang, Xiaolin']","['Guo F', 'Lou J', 'Han X', 'Deng Y', 'Huang X']","['Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyWuhan, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Central Hospital of WuhanWuhan, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyWuhan, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyWuhan, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyWuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BDNF signaling pathway', 'cognitive impairment', 'focal cerebral ischemia', 'hippocampal neurogenesis', 'rTMS']",2017/08/22 06:00,2017/08/22 06:01,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2017/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2017.00559 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2017 Aug 2;8:559. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2017.00559. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5539749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few reports have examined the effect of YAP inhibition in human leukemia HL-60 cells. Methods: We examined the effects of YAP knockdown or inhibition using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or verteporfin (VP), respectively. Western blot assays were used to determine the expression levels of YAP, Survivin, cyclinD1, PARP, Bcl-2, and Bax. Cell proliferation was assessed using the cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry, and apoptotic cell morphology was observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. Results: Knockdown or inhibition of YAP led to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and increased apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, increased levels of Bax and cleaved PARP, and decreased levels of PARP, Bcl-2, Survivin, and cyclinD1. Moreover, Hoechst 33342 staining revealed increased cell nuclear fragmentation. Conclusion: Collectively, these results show that inhibition of YAP inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells.

It is characterized by overproduction of immature myeloid cells in bone marrow which crowds out normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). TIM-3, an immune regulatory molecule, is an LSC specific surface marker in AML with high expression on these cells compared to HSCs. Studies have indicated that micro RNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in either cancer progression or suppression. Based on bioinformatics assessments, we have predicted that miR-125a-3p could be a miRNA with high suppressive activity on TIM-3 expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of miR-125a-3p on TIM-3 gene expression in an AML cell line, HL-60, in vitro. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplied with 10 % FBS. TIM-3 expression was induced on the cells using phorbol miristate acetate. The cells were transfected with miR-125-3p for 24 h and the gene and protein expression of TIM-3 were measured using q-RT-PCR and flow-cytometery methods, respectively. The results of this study showed that miR-125a-3p has a strong silencing effect on TIM-3 gene and protein expression on HL-60 cell line. Based to our results, miR125a-3p can strongly silence TIM-3 expression in AML cell line. Thus, our results have confirmed the bioinformatics prediction of suppressive effect of miR-125a-3p on TIM-3with Mirwalk and Target Scan softwares.","['Emamdoost, Fatemeh', 'Khanahmad, Hossein', 'Ganjalikhani-Hakemi, Mazdak', 'Doosti, Abbas']","['Emamdoost F', 'Khanahmad H', 'Ganjalikhani-Hakemi M', 'Doosti A']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shahrekord, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.0000 0001 1498 685Xgrid.411036.1', 'Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.0000 0001 1498 685Xgrid.411036.1', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shahrekord, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161006,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'TIM-3', 'miR-125a-3p']",2017/08/22 06:00,2017/08/22 06:01,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-016-0733-4 [doi]', '733 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2017 Sep;33(3):342-347. doi: 10.1007/s12288-016-0733-4.

In many tumors up-regulation miRNAs has been reported especially miR-222 has been shown to be up-regulated in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In this study we assessed the effected inhibition of miR-222 in cell viability of B-CLL. We performed inhibition of mir-222 in B-CLL cell line (183-E95) using locked nucleic acid (LNA) antagomir. At different time points after LNA-anti-mir-222 transfection, miR-222 quantitation and cell viability were assessed by qRT-real time polymerase chain reaction and MTT assays. The data were analyzed by independent t test and one way ANOVA. Down-regulation of miR-222 in B-CLL cell line (183-E95) with LNA antagomir decreased cell viability in B-CLL. Cell viability gradually decreased over time as the viability of LNA-anti-mir transfected cells was <47 % of untreated cells at 72 h post-transfection. The difference in cell viability between LNA-anti-miR and control groups was statistically significant (p < 0.042).

Nevertheless, most of these cases express BCL2. To elucidate mechanisms triggering BCL2 expression and promoting pathogenesis in t(14;18)-negative FL, exonic single-nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles of 28 t(14;18)-positive and 13 t(14;18)-negative FL were analyzed, followed by the integration of copy-number changes, copy-neutral LOH and published gene-expression data as well as the assessment of immunoglobulin N-glycosylation sites. Typical FL mutations also affected t(14;18)-negative FL. Curated gene set/pathway annotation of genes mutated in either t(14;18)-positive or t(14;18)-negative FL revealed a strong enrichment of same or similar gene sets but also a more prominent or exclusive enrichment of immune response and N-glycosylation signatures in t(14;18)-negative FL. Mutated genes showed high BCL2 association in both subgroups. Among the genes mutated in t(14;18)-negative FL 555 were affected by copy-number alterations and/or copy-neutral LOH and 96 were differently expressed between t(14;18)-positive and t(14;18)-negative FL (P<0.01). N-glycosylation sites were detected considerably less frequently in t(14;18)-negative FL. These results suggest a diverse portfolio of genetic alterations that may induce or regulate BCL2 expression or promote pathogenesis of t(14;18)-negative FL as well as a less specific but increased crosstalk with the microenvironment that may compensate for the lack of N-glycosylation.","['Zamo, A', 'Pischimarov, J', 'Schlesner, M', 'Rosenstiel, P', 'Bomben, R', 'Horn, H', 'Grieb, T', 'Nedeva, T', 'Lopez, C', 'Haake, A', 'Richter, J', 'Trumper, L', 'Lawerenz, C', 'Klapper, W', 'Moller, P', 'Hummel, M', 'Lenze, D', 'Szczepanowski, M', 'Flossbach, L', 'Schreder, M', 'Gattei, V', 'Ott, G', 'Siebert, R', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Leich, E']","['Zamo A', 'Pischimarov J', 'Schlesner M', 'Rosenstiel P', 'Bomben R', 'Horn H', 'Grieb T', 'Nedeva T', 'Lopez C', 'Haake A', 'Richter J', 'Trumper L', 'Lawerenz C', 'Klapper W', 'Moller P', 'Hummel M', 'Lenze D', 'Szczepanowski M', 'Flossbach L', 'Schreder M', 'Gattei V', 'Ott G', 'Siebert R', 'Rosenwald A', 'Leich E']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Theoretical Bioinformatics (B080), Computational Oncology Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Research, CRO, Aviano, Italy.', 'Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute for Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Hospital, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Charite-University Hospital Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Charite-University Hospital Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Research, CRO, Aviano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170821,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",,,2017/08/22 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2017/08/22 06:00'],"['2017/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017270 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.270 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Mar;32(3):685-693. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.270.

RESULTS: IL6 promoter methylation was higher in GS workers (p < 0.05). Also in GS, CYP2E1 promoter methylation negatively correlated with benzene levels (r = -0.47, p < 0.05); iNOS promoter methylation positively correlated with CYP2E1 promoter methylation (r = 0.29, p < 0.05), cumulative time of exposure (r = 0.31, p < 0.05) as well as with urinary levels of S- Phenyl mercapturic acid (SPMA), (r = 0.55, p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate alterations in the inflammation pathway at the epigenetic level associated with exposure to benzene. Correlations between iNOS methylation with both CYP2E1 methylation and urinary SPMA levels represent novel evidence about CYP2E1 epigenetic regulation and activity related with nitrosative stress, making promoter methylation status of these genes a potential biomarker in early stages of oncogenesis.","['Jimenez-Garza, Octavio', 'Guo, Liqiong', 'Byun, Hyang-Min', 'Carrieri, Mariella', 'Bartolucci, Giovanni Battista', 'Zhong, Jia', 'Baccarelli, Andrea A']","['Jimenez-Garza O', 'Guo L', 'Byun HM', 'Carrieri M', 'Bartolucci GB', 'Zhong J', 'Baccarelli AA']","['Health Sciences Division, University of Guanajuato, Leon Campus, Blvd. Puente del Mienio 1001, Fraccion del Predio San Carlos, C.P. 37670 Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico.

To determine the role of TET2 deficiency in leukemia stem cell maintenance, we generated a reversible transgenic RNAi mouse to model restoration of endogenous Tet2 expression. Tet2 restoration reverses aberrant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with vitamin C, a co-factor of Fe2(+) and alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenases, mimics TET2 restoration by enhancing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine formation in Tet2-deficient mouse HSPCs and suppresses human leukemic colony formation and leukemia progression of primary human leukemia PDXs. Vitamin C also drives DNA hypomethylation and expression of a TET2-dependent gene signature in human leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, TET-mediated DNA oxidation induced by vitamin C treatment in leukemia cells enhances their sensitivity to PARP inhibition and could provide a safe and effective combination strategy to selectively target TET deficiency in cancer.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted in patients with AML from 2007 to 2011. Oral health status was determined from a pre-allo-HCT dental evaluation. Positive blood cultures were recorded from AML induction to post-allo-HCT day +60. Organisms that caused bacteremia were classified as ""of possible oral source"" by a blinded microbiologist. Two-sided Fisher's exact test was used to compare the oral health status of the entire cohort with that of patients with blood cultures of potential oral source. RESULTS: Pre-allo-HCT dental evaluations were completed in 91 (99%) of 92 patients. Of these 91 patients, 13 (14%) with dental pathology (13 of 13 [100%]) completed all required dental treatment before allo-HCT. Bacteremias occurred in 63 of 92 patients (68%), and 12 (19%) of 63 patients had positive blood cultures of potential oral source. Of these, 1 of 12 patients developed bacteremia during AML induction, and 11 of 12 developed bacteremia during allo-HCT. CONCLUSIONS: Oral health status was not associated with risk of bacteremia of potential oral source either at AML induction or consolidation or at allo-HCT.","['Sultan, Ahmed S', 'Zimering, Yvette', 'Petruzziello, Gloria', 'Alyea, Edwin P 3rd', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Sonis, Stephen T', 'Woo, Sook-Bin', 'Marty, Francisco M', 'Treister, Nathaniel S']","['Sultan AS', 'Zimering Y', 'Petruzziello G', 'Alyea EP 3rd', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ho VT', 'Sonis ST', 'Woo SB', 'Marty FM', 'Treister NS']","[""Division of Oral Medicine and Dentistry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Oral Medicine, Infection and Immunity, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.

It provides a permissive environment for minimal residual disease and contributes to relapse and multidrug resistance. Mesenchymal stem cells are a kind of important stromal cells in bone marrow niche. In recent researches, MSC have been shown to be one of the major factors modulating the biological features of leukemia cells. The cross-talk between MSC and leukemia cells can take place not only by direct contact, but also by exosome exchange. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles released by a variety of cells, which contain protein, RNA and mRNA. They are effective tools for transportation between cells, and play an important role in many physiological and pathological processes. Exosome is a new topic in the research of leukemia and microenvironment. The exosome research will help elucidate the mechanism of leukemia, thus providing new ideas for the treatment.","['Yang, Ya-Zhi', 'Zhang, Xiao-Yan', 'Fang, Li-Jun', 'Wan, Qian', 'Li, Jian']","['Yang YZ', 'Zhang XY', 'Fang LJ', 'Wan Q', 'Li J']","['Key Laboratory of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China; Medical Department of Nanchang University Graduate School, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China; Medical Department of Nanchang University Graduate School, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China; Medical Department of Nanchang University Graduate School, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China; Medical Department of Nanchang University Graduate School, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.

METHODS: All clinical data of 60 patients diagnosed as primary MDS over a period of 5 years were collected and compared. The bone marrow short-term culture and G banding technique were used to analyze the chromosome karyotypes of 60 patients, the flow cytometry was used to detect the immune phenotypes(CD10, CD13, CD15, CD7, CD34, CD117). SPSS 19.0 software was applied to deal with all data, the WHO2008 classification and IPSS-R score were used for grouping of MDS. RESULTS: There were 12 cases of low-risk, and 7 cases of high-risk in 60 patients with MDS; 35 out of 60 patients (58.33%) showed karyotypic abnormalities. The proportion of 5, 7, 8, 20, and Y chromosome abnormality were 22.89%, 20.0%, 17.14%, 11.43% and 5.71%, respectively, complex chromosome karyotype accounted for 14.29%. The percentage of normal karyotype transformed into leukemia was 8.0%, the percentage of other abnormal karyotype transformed into leukemia respectively was 80% for complex karyotype, 66.67% for 8 chromosome abnormality, 71.43% for 7 chromosome abnormality, 75.0% for 5 chromosome abnormality. The expression rate of immature myeloid cell surface antigen markers(CD13, CD33, CD117) in high-risk group of patients with MDS significantly higher than that in low-risk group(P<0.05). And the expression rate of mature myeloid cell surface antigen markers (CD15) in high-risk group was significantly lower than that in low-risk group(P<0.05). The expression rate of lymphoid cell surface antigen markers (CD7, CD10) in high-risk group was lower than that in low-risk group(P<0.05).

METHODS: Twelve cases of CML with positive for t(9;22) translocation, but negative for common major and minor breakpoint cluster regions comfirmed by chromosome karyotyping or FISH analysis, were collected from July 2012 to December 2015. These 12 cases were then detected for b2a3(e13a3), b3a3(e14a3), e6a2, e8a2 and e1a3 fusion variants by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Among 12 cases 4 variant transcripts were detected, including e1a3 in 1 case (8.33%), e8a2 in 2 cases (16.67%), b2a3 in 5 cases (41.67%) and b3a3 in 4 cases (33.33%), with total positivity of 100%, moreover b2a3 and b3a3 were predominant. CONCLUSION: The detecting atypical BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts by real-time quantitative PCR is suitable for the diagnosis of CML negative for P210, P190 and P230 by standard real-time PCR test, and this detection is still the standard and economic method for monitoring minimal residual disease in CML patients with variants of BCR/ABL fusion gene.","['Zou, Yuan', 'DU, Cui', 'Chen, Hong-Mei', 'Guo, Fu-Xiao', 'Cheng, Jian-Bing', 'Tang, Yuan-Yan', 'Wu, Wei', 'Xia, Cheng-Qing']","['Zou Y', 'DU C', 'Chen HM', 'Guo FX', 'Cheng JB', 'Tang YY', 'Wu W', 'Xia CQ']","['Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Hangzhou ADICON Clinical Laboratories, INC., Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Hangzhou ADICON Clinical Laboratories, INC., Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Hangzhou ADICON Clinical Laboratories, INC., Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China.

Clinical manifestation, as well as prognostic gene mutations distribution and immune classification were analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 168 AML newly diagnosed patients, 31 cases with chromosome 21 aberrations including t(8;21) accounting for 67.74% (21/31), and trisomy 21 (16.13%,5/31), 2 variants were found as t(1; 21) and t(1; 21; 8); 77 cases had normal karyotype, and 60 cases possessed other chromosomes aberrations. Statistically significant differences did not exist among age, sex and white blood cell count (P>0.05). However, the 21 cases in chromosome aberrations group were predisposed to lower hemoglobin and platelet count(P<0.05). 5 cases of Trisomy 21 were characterized by M5 2 cases, M1 one case, M2 one case M4 one case. And the rate of C-kit/D816V mutation was higher in t(8;21) aberrations group when 7 prognostic genes including FLT3/ITD, C-kit/D816V, NPM1, DNMT3A, TET2 were analyzed, and the immune classification of t(8; 21) aberration group inclined to CD19(+), CD34(+) but CD33(-), CD64(-). And trisomy 21 displayed a trend to CD34(+) and CD7(+). CONCLUSION: Chromosome 21 is easily involved in acute myeloid leukemia.

METHODS: The SYBR Green-based qRT-PCR was used to assess SHP-1 mRNA levels in 54 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 30 cases of de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 10 persons without malignancy as controls. RESULTS: The relative expression levels of SHP-1 mRNA in control group (CG), chronic phase CML (CP-CML) group, advanced phase of CML (including accelerated phase CML and blastic phase CML) group and AML group were 1.15+/-0.62, 4.96+/-1.76, 2.60+/-0.90 and 0.45+/-0.20, respectively. The expression of SHP-1 mRNA in patients with CML significantly increased in comparison with that in CG(P<0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of SHP-1 mRNA in CP-CML group very significantly increased as compared with that in advanced stage of CML group(P<0.0001). The expression of SHP-1 mRNA in AML group significantly decreased as compared with that in CG group(P=0.0442). In CP-CML group, statistical analysis showed that SHP-1 mRNA expression at baseline in optimal responders (5.712+/-0.4476) was significantly higher than that in the suboptimal or failed responders (4.044+/-0.3701)(P=0.0090). Meanwhile, the SHP-1 mRNA expression in AML patients was higher than that in CR group (0.4984+/-0.05164) and non-CR group (0.3537+/-0.02388)(P=0.0017). CONCLUSION: The SHP-1 mRNA levels in CML patients are higher than that in AML patients, and probably correlats with disease progression of CML. The mRNA expression level of SHP-1 may be a molecular marker to predict early response to inatinib treatment in CP-CML and AML.","['Liu, Xue-Dong', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Li, Ying-Hua', 'Zhang, Yong-Xiao', 'Li, Zhi-Shang']","['Liu XD', 'Liu X', 'Li YH', 'Zhang YX', 'Li ZS']","['Hengshui Blood Center, Hengshui 053000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hengshui 053000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hengshui 053000, Hebei Province, China.

METHODS: P14(ARF) expression both in AML1-ETO-expressing cells or U937 nonexpressing cells and in leukemia cells of AML patients with or without t(8;21) was assessed by quantitative PCR. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to analyze the methylation status of p14(ARF) promoter. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based PCR was used to investigate the direct interaction between the AML1-ETO and p14(ARF) promoter in AML1-ETO positive leukemia cell line. And the p14(ARF) mRNA expression level was detected by qRT-PCR after treatment with 5-Aza. RESULTS: AML1-ETO-expressing cell subclone displayed low level of p14(ARF) mRNA in comparison with the non-transfected U937. In primary bone marrow cells of acute myeloid leukemia containing AML1-ETO, level of p14(ARF) mRNA was markedly lower when compared with other acute myeloid leukemias lacking this translocation. P14(ARF) gene promoter was non-methylated in control group and primary leukemia cells of AML patients without t(8;21) and was hyper-methylated in U937-A/E1-4 and primary leukemia cells of AML patients with t(8;21). The enriched regions in transfected cells were located within p14(ARF) promoter. 5-Aza could increase the expression of p14(ARF). CONCLUSION: P14(ARF) is a possible target gene of AML1-ETO. The p14(ARF) silencing induced by hyper-methlylation may be an important factor for occurrence and development of the M2b subtype of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Zhuang, Wen-Yue', 'Li, Zheng-Yi', 'Chen, Yi-Hua', 'Liu, Yan', 'Chen, Zi-Xing']","['Zhuang WY', 'Li ZY', 'Chen YH', 'Liu Y', 'Chen ZX']","['Medical Ecsomatics College of Beihua University,Jilin 132013, Jilin Province, China.', 'School of Laboratory Examination, Jilin Medical and Pharmaceutical College,Jilin 132013, Jilin Province, China.', 'Jilin Central Hospital, Jilin 132013, Jilin Province, China.', 'Medical Ecsomatics College of Beihua University,Jilin 132013, Jilin Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China.

Therefore, the main intention of this study was to reveal DON and ZEN effects on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune related genes in the liver of piglets. METHODS: In the present study, 15 six-week-old piglets were randomly assigned to the following three different dietary treatments for 4 weeks: control diet, diet containing 8 mg DON/kg feed, and diet containing 0.8 mg ZEN/kg feed. After 4 weeks, liver samples were collected and sequenced using RNA-Seq to investigate the effects of the mycotoxins on genes and gene networks associated with the immune systems of the piglets. RESULTS: Our analysis identified a total of 249 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which included 99 upregulated and 150 downregulated genes in both the DON and ZEN dietary treatment groups. After biological pathway analysis, the DEGs were determined to be significantly enriched in gene ontology terms associated with many biological pathways, including immune response and cellular and metabolic processes. Consistent with inflammatory stimulation due to the mycotoxin-contaminated diet, the following Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways, which were related to disease and immune responses, were found to be enriched in the DEGs: allograft rejection pathway, cell adhesion molecules, graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), type I diabetes mellitus, human T-cell leukemia lymphoma virus infection, and viral carcinogenesis. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed that DON and ZEN treatments downregulated the expression of the majority of the DEGs that were associated with inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 receptor, beta, chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 9), proliferation (insulin-like growth factor 1, major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2A, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, lipase G, and salt inducible kinase 1), and other immune response networks (paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor beta, Src-like-adaptor-1 [SLA1], SLA3, SLA5, SLA7, claudin 4, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, thyrotropin-releasing hormone degrading enzyme, ubiquitin D, histone H2B type 1, and serum amyloid A).

We have analyzed risk factors of early death from 526 consecutive newly diagnosed APL patients between 2004 and 2016. The overall incidence of early death was 7.2% (38/526). The peak hazard of early death occurred in the first 0-3 days. Multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated white blood cell (WBC) counts [odds ratio (OR) = 1.039; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.024-1.055; P < 0.001], age (OR = 1.061; 95% CI: 1.025-1.099; P = 0.001) and platelet counts (OR = 0.971; 95% CI: 0.944-0.999; P = 0.038) were independent risk factors for early death. Furthermore, receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses revealed a simple WBC/platelet ratio was significantly more accurate in predicting early death [areas under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.842, 95% CI: 0.807-0.872) than WBC counts (AUC = 0.793; 95% CI: 0.756-0.827) or Sanz score (AUC = 0.746; 95% CI: 0.706-0.783). We stratified APL patients into four risk subgroups: low risk (WBC </= 10 x 10(9)/L, platelet >40 x 10(9)/L), intermediate risk (WBC/platelet <0.2 and age </= 60, not in low risk), high risk (WBC/platelet >/=0.2 or age > 60, not in low and ultra-high risk) and ultra-high risk (WBC > 50 x 10(9)/L), the early death rates were 0, 0.6, 12.8, and 41.2%, respectively. In conclusion, we proposed a modified Sanz risk model as a useful predictor of early death risk in patients with APL.","['Lou, Yinjun', 'Ma, Yafang', 'Sun, Jianai', 'Suo, Sansan', 'Tong, Hongyan', 'Qian, Wenbin', 'Mai, Wenyuan', 'Meng, Haitao', 'Jin, Jie']","['Lou Y', 'Ma Y', 'Sun J', 'Suo S', 'Tong H', 'Qian W', 'Mai W', 'Meng H', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China. zjuhematology@163.com.', ""Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. zjuhematology@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170819,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Mortality/trends', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Early death', 'Prediction', 'Prognostic factors', 'White blood cell']",2017/08/22 06:00,2017/10/28 06:00,['2017/08/21 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3096-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3096-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Nov;96(11):1793-1800. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3096-5.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with a twofold increased risk of both Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is unknown whether treatment with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) affect the risk of specific lymphoma subtypes. METHODS: Patients never exposed to (bionaive) or ever treated with bDMARDs from 12 European biologic registers were followed prospectively for the occurrence of first ever histologically confirmed lymphoma. Patients were considered exposed to a bDMARD after having received the first dose. Lymphomas were attributed to the most recently received bDMARD. RESULTS: Among 124 997 patients (mean age 59 years; 73.7% female), 533 lymphomas were reported. Of these, 9.5% were HL, 83.8% B-cell NHL and 6.8% T-cell NHL. No cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma were observed. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the most frequent B-cell NHL subtype (55.8% of all B-cell NHLs). The subtype distributions were similar between bionaive patients and those treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). For other bDMARDs, the numbers of cases were too small to draw any conclusions. Patients with RA developed more DLBCLs and less chronic lymphocytic leukaemia compared with the general population. CONCLUSION: This large collaborative analysis of European registries has successfully collated subtype information on 533 lymphomas. While the subtype distribution differs between RA and the general population, there was no evidence of any modification of the distribution of lymphoma subtypes in patients with RA treated with TNFi compared with bionaive patients.","['Mercer, Louise K', 'Regierer, Anne C', 'Mariette, Xavier', 'Dixon, William G', 'Baecklund, Eva', 'Hellgren, Karin', 'Dreyer, Lene', 'Hetland, Merete Lund', 'Cordtz, Rene', 'Hyrich, Kimme', 'Strangfeld, Anja', 'Zink, Angela', 'Canhao, Helena', 'Hernandez, M Victoria', 'Tubach, Florence', 'Gottenberg, Jacques-Eric', 'Morel, Jacques', 'Zavada, Jakub', 'Iannone, Florenzo', 'Askling, Johan', 'Listing, Joachim']","['Mercer LK', 'Regierer AC', 'Mariette X', 'Dixon WG', 'Baecklund E', 'Hellgren K', 'Dreyer L', 'Hetland ML', 'Cordtz R', 'Hyrich K', 'Strangfeld A', 'Zink A', 'Canhao H', 'Hernandez MV', 'Tubach F', 'Gottenberg JE', 'Morel J', 'Zavada J', 'Iannone F', 'Askling J', 'Listing J']","['Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Epidemiology Unit, German Rheumatism Research Centre, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Universite Paris-Sud, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin Bicetre, Paris, France.', 'Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases, Gentofte University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'The Parker Institute, Frederiksberg, Denmark.', 'DANBIO, Copenhagen Center for Arthritis Research, Centre of Head and Orthopaedics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases, Gentofte University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'The Parker Institute, Frederiksberg, Denmark.', 'Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit, National Institute of Health Research Manchester, Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science, Manchester, UK.', 'Epidemiology Unit, German Rheumatism Research Centre, Berlin, Germany.', 'Epidemiology Unit, German Rheumatism Research Centre, Berlin, Germany.', 'ChariteUniversitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'EpiDoC Unit, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, CEDOC, NOVA Medical School and National School of Public Health, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departement of BIOSPIM, Departement BIOSPIM Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Sorbonne Universites, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Rheumatology, CHU Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Rheumatology, University of Montpellier and Teaching Hospital Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.', 'Institute of Rheumatology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Rheumatology Unit, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Epidemiology Unit, German Rheumatism Research Centre, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170819,England,Ann Rheum Dis,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,0372355,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antirheumatic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['DMARDs(biologic)', 'anti-TNF', 'epidemiology', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",2017/08/22 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['annrheumdis-2017-211623 [pii]', '10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-211623 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Rheum Dis. 2017 Dec;76(12):2025-2030. doi: 10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-211623.

The mechanisms of leukaemogenesis in ATL are incompletely understood. Insertional mutagenesis has not previously been thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of ATL. However, the recent discovery that HTLV-1 binds the key chromatin architectural protein CTCF raises the hypothesis that HTLV-1 deregulates host gene expression by causing abnormal chromatin looping, bringing the strong HTLV-1 promoter-enhancer near to host genes that lie up to 2Mb from the integrated provirus. Here we review current opinion on the mechanisms of oncogenesis in ATL, with particular emphasis on the local and distant impact of HTLV-1 on the structure and expression of the host genome.","['Cook, Lucy', 'Melamed, Anat', 'Yaguchi, Hiroko', 'Bangham, Charles Rm']","['Cook L', 'Melamed A', 'Yaguchi H', 'Bangham CR']","['Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom; National Centre for Human Retrovirology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive CML patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib in a single center were analyzed (n = 170). BCR-ABL1 transcript was evaluated using multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Exclusively patients with BCR-ABL transcripts e13a2 and/or e14a2 were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Patients with e14a2 transcripts presented higher rates of optimal molecular responses at 3 months and higher rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCR) at 6 months. E13a2, e14a2, and e14a2 with e13a2 (e14a2+e13a2) groups presented similar rates of 5-year event-free, progression-free, and overall survival. There was a superior 10-year overall survival in patients with transcripts e13a2 compared with e14a2 (alone or coexpressed with e13a2; 93% vs. 73%; P = .03), although the 5-year overall survival was 96% vs. 88%, respectively (P = not significant). In a multivariate analysis, high/intermediate Sokal score and e14a3/e14a3+e14a2 were independent factors for poor overall survival (hazard risk [HR], 4.63; P = .023 for Sokal score and HR, 10.6; P = .041 for BCR-ABL transcript). CONCLUSION: Patients with BCR-ABL transcripts e14a2 transcripts have higher rates of CCR at 6 months and higher rates of optimal molecular response at 3 months compared with e13a2 or with both transcripts, but no difference in 5-year overall, progression-free, and event-free survival. There was a superior 10-year overall survival among patients with transcripts e13a2 compared with e14a2 (alone or coexpressed with e13a2).","['Pagnano, Katia Borgia Barbosa', 'Miranda, Eliana Cristina', 'Delamain, Marcia Torresan', 'Duarte, Gislaine Oliveira', 'de Paula, Erich Vinicius', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene', 'de Souza, Carmino Antonio']","['Pagnano KBB', 'Miranda EC', 'Delamain MT', 'Duarte GO', 'de Paula EV', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'de Souza CA']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, especially on a transcription factor (TF) level. In this study, a new method, concatenated tandem array of consensus transcription factor response elements (catTFREs), and an Illumina-based RNA-seq technology were integrated to systematically investigate the role of TFs in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes; the damage was then rescued by Danhong injection (DHI), a Chinese standardized product approved for cardiovascular diseases treatment. The overall gene expression revealed cell apoptosis and DNA repair were vital for cardiomyocytes in resisting oxidative stress. By comprehensively integrating the transcription activity of TFs and their downstream target genes, an important TFs-target network were constructed and 13 TFs were identified as critical TFs in DHI-mediated protection in H2O2-induced oxidative stress. By using the integrated approach, seven TFs of these 13 TFs were also identified in melatonin-mediated protection in H2O2-induced damage. Furthermore, the transcription activity of DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase (Apex1), Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2D (Mef2d) and Pre B-cell leukemia transcription factor 3 (Pbx3) was further verified in pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. This research offers a new understanding of cardiomyocytes in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress and reveals additional potential therapeutic targets. The combination of two parallel omics datasets (corresponding to the transcriptome and proteome) can reduce the noise in high-throughput data and reveal the fundamental changes of the biological process, making it suitable and reliable for investigation of critical targets in many other complicated pathological processes.","['Zhang, Jingjing', 'Guo, Feifei', 'Wei, Junying', 'Xian, Minghua', 'Tang, Shihuan', 'Zhao, Ye', 'Liu, Mingwei', 'Song, Lei', 'Geng, Ya', 'Yang, Hongjun', 'Ding, Chen', 'Huang, Luqi']","['Zhang J', 'Guo F', 'Wei J', 'Xian M', 'Tang S', 'Zhao Y', 'Liu M', 'Song L', 'Geng Y', 'Yang H', 'Ding C', 'Huang L']","['Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 102206, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 102206, China.', 'School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan 250355, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.

However, its involvement in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR assay demonstrated that miR-122 expression in bone marrow specimens from AML children were significantly lower than that in non-malignant controls (P<0.001). Statistically, AML children with low miR-122 expression more frequently had large white blood cell count (P=0.022), French-American-British classification subtype M7 (P<0.001), unfavorable cytogenetics (P=0.002) and day 7 response to the treatment (P=0.036), short relapse-free (P=0.001) and overall (P=0.008) survivals than those with high expression. Multivariate analysis also determined that miR-122 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both relapse-free and overall survivals. Functionally, the enforced expression of miR-122 in AML cell lines efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and reduced the ratio of S-phase cells in vitro (all P<0.05). In conclusion, the abnormal expression of miR-122 may be a marker of the aggressive progression in childhood AML. Importantly, its downregulation may serve as a prognostic factor to predict poor outcome. Our study also reveal that miR-122 may function as a tumor suppressor in childhood AML, highlighting a new therapeutic strategy for this malignancy.","['Yang, Juan', 'Yuan, Yufang', 'Yang, Xiaochun', 'Hong, Ze', 'Yang, Lijuan']","['Yang J', 'Yuan Y', 'Yang X', 'Hong Z', 'Yang L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an Hospital Affiliated to Xuzhou Medical College and Huai'an Second People's Hospital, 62 Huaihai Road South, Huai'an 223002, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an Hospital Affiliated to Xuzhou Medical College and Huai'an Second People's Hospital, 62 Huaihai Road South, Huai'an 223002, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an Hospital Affiliated to Xuzhou Medical College and Huai'an Second People's Hospital, 62 Huaihai Road South, Huai'an 223002, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, Jiangsu 223300, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, Jiangsu 223300, China.

This study sought to assess the association between statins and the risk for cancer-associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed cancer were followed for up to one year in a healthcare claims database (2010-2013). Three treatment groups included statin users, non-statin cholesterol lowering medication users, and an untreated group with pre-existing indications for statin therapy (hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or heart disease). Propensity score matched groups were compared using competing risks survival models for DVT and PE outcomes reporting the hazard ratios (HR) between the treatment groups. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of age and individual medications. RESULTS: The total cohort included 170,459 patients, which, after matching, were similar on baseline characteristics. The overall model showed a statistically significant protective effect for statins compared to no treatment attributed only to leukemia for DVT (HR=0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.99) and colorectal cancers for PE (HR=0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99) in stratified analyses. There were generally no differences in outcomes between statins and non-statins and no individual statin use showed results different from the class effect. CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity score matched sample of patients with cancer, statins were shown to have a small protective effect in some cancers for DVT or PE compared to no treatment and little difference compared to an active control group. The lack of effect was consistent across statins and was also not found for any of the sensitivity analyses included.","['El-Refai, Sherif M', 'Black, Esther P', 'Adams, Val R', 'Talbert, Jeffery C', 'Brown, Joshua D']","['El-Refai SM', 'Black EP', 'Adams VR', 'Talbert JC', 'Brown JD']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, KY, USA; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida College of Pharmacy, Gainesville, FL, USA.

Nuclear beta-catenin accumulation correlates with malignancy. Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha by inhibiting HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation, which promotes glycolytic energy metabolism, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, whereas HIF-1alpha is degraded by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase under normoxic conditions. We focus this review on the links between the activated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the mechanisms underlying vasculogenesis and angiogenesis through HIF-1alpha under normoxic conditions in gliomas. Wnt-induced epidermal growth factor receptor/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, Wnt-induced signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, and Wnt/beta-catenin target gene transduction (c-Myc) can activate HIF-1alpha in a hypoxia-independent manner. The PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway activates HIF-1alpha through eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and STAT3. The beta-catenin/T-cell factor 4 complex directly binds to STAT3 and activates HIF-1alpha, which up-regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc in a positive feedback loop. Phosphorylated STAT3 by interleukin-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor activates HIF-1alpha even under normoxic conditions. The activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway induces, via the Wnt target genes c-Myc and cyclin D1 or via HIF-1alpha, gene transactivation encoding aerobic glycolysis enzymes, such as glucose transporter, hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase M2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase-A, leading to lactate production, as the primary alternative of ATP, at all oxygen levels, even in normoxic conditions. Lactate released by glioma cells via the monocarboxylate lactate transporter-1 up-regulated by HIF-1alpha and lactate anion activates HIF-1alpha in normoxic endothelial cells by inhibiting HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation and preventing HIF labeling by the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Increased lactate with acid environment and HIF-1alpha overexpression induce the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis under normoxic conditions. Hypoxia and acidic pH have no synergistic effect on VEGF transcription.","['Vallee, Alexandre', 'Guillevin, Remy', 'Vallee, Jean-Noel']","['Vallee A', 'Guillevin R', 'Vallee JN']","['Experimental and Clinical Neurosciences Laboratory, INSERM U1084, University of Poitiers, 11 Boulevard Marie et Pierre Curie, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', 'DACTIM, UMR CNRS 7348, Universite de Poitiers et CHU de Poitiers, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Mathematiques et Applications (LMA), UMR CNRS 7348, University of Poitiers, F-86000 Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Rev Neurosci,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Glioma/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/chemically induced', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HIF-1alpha', '*Wnt/beta-catenin pathway', '*angiogenesis', '*gliomas', '*normoxia', '*vasculogenesis']",2017/08/20 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2017/08/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/revneuro-2017-0032 [doi]', '/j/revneuro.ahead-of-print/revneuro-2017-0032/revneuro-2017-0032.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Rev Neurosci. 2018 Jan 26;29(1):71-91. doi: 10.1515/revneuro-2017-0032.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9158-4467'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall endogenous retroviral transcription profile in bone marrow (BM) samples. A total of 30 paediatric high-risk leukaemia patients (lymphoid and myeloid malignancies) were tested for HERVs virus gene expression. Our findings show that HERV-K expression was significantly higher in leukaemia patients when compared to healthy donors of a similar median age. We observed a significantly high expression of HERV-K in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. In this study, we also found a relative overexpression of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K in BM cells from the majority of leukemia samples analyzed, in particular in ALL. This overexpression might be related to lymphatic leukemogenesis and it warrants further investigations.","['Bergallo, Massimiliano', 'Montanari, Paola', 'Mareschi, Katia', 'Merlino, Chiara', 'Berger, Massimo', 'Bini, Ilaria', 'Dapra, Valentina', 'Galliano, Ilaria', 'Fagioli, Franca']","['Bergallo M', 'Montanari P', 'Mareschi K', 'Merlino C', 'Berger M', 'Bini I', 'Dapra V', 'Galliano I', 'Fagioli F']","['Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, University of Turin, Medical School, 10136, Turin, Italy.

Most of these cases are known to be associated with inv(14q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) or rarely t(X;14)(q28;q11). However, T-PLL can show variations in clinical presentation, morphology or immunophenotype that can make a diagnosis of T-PLL challenging. We aim to explore the value of ancillary testing in the diagnosis of T-PLL. METHODS: With this large cohort of 69 patients with T-PLL, we compared the diagnostic utility of conventional cytogenetics, TCL1 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and TCL1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: Conventional karyotyping was performed in all 69 patients and was abnormal in 44 (65%), showing 14q32 abnormalities in 31 (43%) and t(X;14) (MTCP) in 2 (3%). TCL1 rearrangement was assessed by FISH in 26 cases and was positive in 23 (85%). All cases with 14q32 abnormalities shown by karyotype were positive for TCL1 rearrangement by FISH, whereas 12/15 (80%) cases without 14q32 abnormalities were also positive. TCL1 overexpression by IHC was detected in 51/64 (81%), including 40/42 (95%) cases with TCL1/14q32 rearrangement, and 3 cases without, showing a concordance of 89%. TCL1 IHC was negative in both cases with t(X;14)(q28;q11). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that TCL1 by IHC is a convenient test, positive in >80% T-PLL. Conventional cytogenetics is insensitive in the detection of 14q32/TCL1 rearrangements but provides more complete information of the chromosomal landscape of T-PLL. FISH for TCL1 rearrangement is very valuable in diagnostic challenging cases.","['Sun, Yi', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Hu, Zhihong', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Sun Y', 'Tang G', 'Hu Z', 'Thakral B', 'Miranda RN', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20170818,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Fish', 'Haematology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukaemia']",2017/08/20 06:00,2018/03/24 06:00,['2017/08/20 06:00'],"['2017/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2017-204616 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2017-204616 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2018 Apr;71(4):309-315. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2017-204616.

Although very effective, patients taking dasatinib often display severe adverse effects, including pleural effusions and increased risk of bleeding primarily in the gastrointestinal tract. The actual causes of these side effects are currently undetermined. We hypothesize that endothelial cells (ECs) that line the inner walls of blood vessels and control the traffic to the underlying tissues might be involved.Experimental Design: The effects of TKIs on ECs were studied by various assays, such as real-time cell impedance measurements, live-cell microscopy, wound healing, Western blot, and an in vivo model.Results: Dasatinib uniquely causes a profound, dose-dependent disorganization of the EC monolayers. Dasatinib promoted the disassembly of cell-cell contacts, altered cell-matrix contacts, and further altered the wound healing. A key observation is that this effect is fully reversible after drug washout. In line with these in vitro observations, intraperitoneal administration of dasatinib to mice caused significant vascular leakage in the intestine. The underlying molecular mechanism of dasatinib-induced reorganization of the actin involves ROCK activation, which increases the amount of the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and consequently activates the non-muscle myosin II.Conclusions: Our data are consistent with a scenario in which dasatinib triggers a transient increase in vascular leakage that probably contributes to adverse effects such as bleeding diathesis and pleural effusions.

DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are probably one of the most detrimental types of DNA damage. It has been shown that DNA-PK is highly expressed in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells. Less well appreciated was the effect of DNA-PK inhibition on sensitivity of BCP-ALL cells to DNA-damaging agents. Here, we show that the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in BCP-ALL cell lines (NALM-6, SUP-B15), correlating with a reduction in DSB repair measured by gamma-H2AX foci. NU7441 affected the cell cycle distribution and the cell cycle regulatory molecules in combination with doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin-induced DNA-PK phosphorylation was decreased in the presence of NU7441. Apoptosis induction by the combined treatment was associated with marked reduction of Bcl-2 and survivin and a significant increase of Bax mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, our data indicate that inhibition of DNA-PK might be an effective approach to enhance the tumor-cell-killing effects of DNA-damaging agents such as doxorubicin in BCP-ALL and may deliver novel, targeted therapy into the clinic.","['Alikarami, Fatemeh', 'Safa, Majid', 'Faranoush, Mohammad', 'Hayat, Parisa', 'Kazemi, Ahmad']","['Alikarami F', 'Safa M', 'Faranoush M', 'Hayat P', 'Kazemi A']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Germany decided on a binding U guideline value in drinking water of 10 microg/L, valid since 2011. It is yet widely unknown if and how public health was affected by elevated U concentrations before that. In this ecological study we summarized available drinking water U data for the German federal state of Bavaria (703 analyses in total for 553 different municipalities) at county level (for 76 out of 96 Bavarian counties, representing about 83% of Bavaria's and about 13% of Germany's total population) in terms of mean and maximum U concentration. Bavaria is known to regionally exhibit mainly geogenically elevated groundwater U with a maximum value of 40 microg/L in the database used here. Public health data were obtained from federal statistical authorities at county resolution. These included incidence rates of diagnosed diseases suspected to be potentially associated with chronic U uptake, e.g., diseases of the skeleton, the liver or the thyroid as well as tumor and genito-urinary diseases. The datasets were analyzed for interrelations and mutual spatial occurrence using statistical approaches and GIS as well as odds ratios and relative risks calculations. Weak but significant positive associations between maximum U concentrations and aggregated ICD-10 diagnose groups for growths/tumors as well as liver diseases were observed, elevated incidence rates of thyroid diseases seem to occur where mean drinking water U concentrations exceed 2 microg/L. Here, we discuss obtained results and their implications for potential impacts of hydrochemistry on public health in southeast Germany.","['Banning, Andre', 'Benfer, Mira']","['Banning A', 'Benfer M']","['Hydrogeology Department, Institute of Geology, Geophysics and Mineralogy, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Universitatsstr. 150, 44801 Bochum, Germany. andre.banning@rub.de.', 'Soil Science and Soil Ecology Department, Institute of Geography, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Universitatsstr. 150, 44801 Bochum, Germany. mira.benfer@rub.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170818,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Drinking Water)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']",IM,"['Drinking Water/*analysis', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Groundwater/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Public Health', '*Radiation Exposure', 'Radiation Monitoring', 'Risk Assessment', 'Uranium/*analysis', 'Water Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bavaria', '*cancer', '*disease', '*groundwater', '*liver', '*odds ratio', '*public health', '*relative risk', '*thyroid', '*uranium']",2017/08/19 06:00,2018/02/16 06:00,['2017/08/19 06:00'],"['2017/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph14080927 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph14080927 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017 Aug 18;14(8). pii: ijerph14080927. doi: 10.3390/ijerph14080927.,,,,PMC5580629,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis, cell cycle and the expression of key apoptosis-related genes in HL-60 were evaluated. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: 5FEM can significantly inhibited growth of HL-60 cells, increased the G2/M population and upregulated the expression of Bax, Fas, FasL, caspase-9 and p21 and downregulated that of Bcl-2 and survivin.

Besides obtaining a temporal regression function, we also test the potential time varying effect of a baseline covariate on future state occupation. We show that the proposed technique has desirable finite sample performances and its performance is competitive when compared with three other existing approaches. We illustrate the proposed methodology using two different data sets.

Upon binding, the complex is internalised and the cytotoxic calicheamicin derivative is released inside the cell, inducing double-strand DNA breakage and subsequent cell death. In June 2017, the EMA granted inotuzumab ozogamicin approval as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The use of inotuzumab ozogamicin in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive, relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor ALL is restricted to those who have failed treatment with at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Inotuzumab ozogamicin was granted priority review for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL by the US FDA in February 2017. In the USA, a phase III trial evaluating inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with frontline chemotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL has recently been initiated and inotuzumab ozogamicin is under phase II evaluation in childhood CD22-positive B-cell ALL. Inotuzumab ozogamicin combination therapies are also being evaluated in the phase I/II or II setting in ALL and chronic myeloid leukaemia and in the phase I setting in Burkitt's lymphoma. This article summarises the milestones in the development of inotuzumab ozogamicin leading to this first approval for ALL.","['Lamb, Yvette N']",['Lamb YN'],"['Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, 0754, Auckland, New Zealand. dru@adis.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",,,2017/08/19 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2017/08/19 06:00'],"['2017/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40265-017-0802-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s40265-017-0802-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2017 Sep;77(14):1603-1610. doi: 10.1007/s40265-017-0802-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment strategies for B-PLL remain to be established, and, until recently, alemtuzumab was the only effective therapeutic option in patients harboring 17p deletions. Herein, we describe, for the first time, a case of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia harboring a 17p deletion in a 48-year-old man that was successfully treated sequentially with idelalisib-rituximab/ibrutinib followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). After 5 months of therapy with idelalisib-rituximab, clinical remission was achieved, but the development of severe diarrhea led to its discontinuation. Subsequently, the patient was treated for 2 months with ibrutinib and the quality of the response was maintained with no severe adverse effects reported. A reduced-intensity conditioning allo-HSCT from a HLA-matched unrelated donor was performed, and, thereafter, the patient has been in complete remission for 10 months now. In conclusion, given the poor prognosis of B-PLL and the lack of effective treatment modalities, the findings here suggest that both ibrutinib and idelalisib should be considered as upfront therapy of B-PLL and as a bridge to allo-HSCT.","['Coelho, H', 'Badior, M', 'Melo, T']","['Coelho H', 'Badior M', 'Melo T']","['Servico de Hematologia, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho, Vila Nova Gaia, Portugal.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho, Vila Nova Gaia, Portugal.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho, Vila Nova Gaia, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20170727,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,,2017/08/19 06:00,2017/08/19 06:01,['2017/08/19 06:00'],"['2017/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/8563218 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2017;2017:8563218. doi: 10.1155/2017/8563218.

Methylation of these proteins alters protein activity and leads to changes in cellular behavior and a series of biological processes. This study aims to investigate the role of SET7/9 in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We examined the expression of SET7/9 in AML cells and NSCLC cells and detected the methylation status of the SET7/9 promoter region. To evaluate the effect of SET7/9 expression changes on cell apoptosis, cell apoptosis rates were determined after SET7/9 overexpression or down-regulation. Our results showed that SET7/9 induces apoptosis of AML cells and inhibits apoptosis of NSCLC cells, suggesting differential effects of SET7/9 on cellular apoptosis and carcinogenesis depending on different cancer types and genetic contexts. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that SET7/9 suppresses cell apoptosis via modulation of E2F1 under circumstance of p53 deficiency in NSCLC cells.","['Gu, Ye', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Wang, Xinling', 'Gao, Lili', 'Yu, Weiping', 'Dong, Wei-Feng']","['Gu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X', 'Gao L', 'Yu W', 'Dong WF']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Medical school of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210009.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical school of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210009.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical school of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210009.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical school of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210009.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical school of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210009.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cross Cancer Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170705,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML cell', 'E2F1.', 'NSCLC cell', 'SET7/9', 'apoptosis', 'p53']",2017/08/19 06:00,2017/08/19 06:01,['2017/08/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.19143 [doi]', 'jcav08p2069 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2017 Jul 5;8(11):2069-2078. doi: 10.7150/jca.19143. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5559969,"['Competing Interests: None of the authors have financial or other potential', 'conflicts of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the molecular mechanisms of RAS GEF catalysis have been unveiled, how SOS1 acquires RAC GEF activity and what is the physio-pathological relevance of this activity is much less understood. Here we show that SOS1 is tyrosine phosphorylated on Y1196 by ABL. Phosphorylation of Y1196 controls SOS1 inter-molecular interaction, is required to promote the exchange of nucleotides on RAC in vitro and for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activation of RAC- and RAC-dependent actin remodeling and cell migration. SOS1 is also phosphorylated on Y1196 by BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemic cells. Importantly, in these cells, SOS1 is required for BCR-ABL-mediated activation of RAC, cell proliferation and transformation in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Finally, genetic removal of Sos1 in the bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) from Sos1(fl/fl) mice and infected with BCR-ABL causes a significant delay in the onset of leukemogenesis once BMDCs are injected into recipient, lethally irradiated mice. Thus, SOS1 is required for full transformation and critically contribute to the leukemogenic potential of BCR-ABL.","['Gerboth, S', 'Frittoli, E', 'Palamidessi, A', 'Baltanas, F C', 'Salek, M', 'Rappsilber, J', 'Giuliani, C', 'Troglio, F', 'Rolland, Y', 'Pruneri, G', 'Kreutmair, S', 'Pallavicini, I', 'Zobel, M', 'Cinquanta, M', 'Minucci, S', 'Gomez, C', 'Santos, E', 'Illert, A L', 'Scita, G']","['Gerboth S', 'Frittoli E', 'Palamidessi A', 'Baltanas FC', 'Salek M', 'Rappsilber J', 'Giuliani C', 'Troglio F', 'Rolland Y', 'Pruneri G', 'Kreutmair S', 'Pallavicini I', 'Zobel M', 'Cinquanta M', 'Minucci S', 'Gomez C', 'Santos E', 'Illert AL', 'Scita G']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca) and CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Cogentech S.c.a.r.l., at IFOM Via Adamello, Milan, Italy.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca) and CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca) and CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, IFOM Foundation, Institute FIRC of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170818,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (SOS1 Protein)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/metabolism', 'SOS1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,,2017/08/19 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2017/08/19 06:00'],"['2017/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017267 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.267 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Mar;32(3):820-827. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.267.

From 7/2008 to 12/2014, Nordic and Baltic centers treated 1509 consecutive patients aged 1-45 years with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL according to the NOPHO ALL2008 without cranial irradiation. Overall, 1022 patients were of age 1-9 years (A), 266 were 10-17 years (B) and 221 were 18-45 years (C). Sixteen patients (three adults) died during induction. All others achieved remission after induction or 1-3 intensive blocks. Subsequently, 45 patients (12 adults) died, 122 patients relapsed (32 adults) with a median time to relapse of 1.6 years and 13 (no adult) developed a second malignancy. Median follow-up time was 4.6 years. Among the three age groups, older patients more often had higher risk ALL due to T-ALL (32%/25%/9%, P<0.001), KMT2A rearrangements (6%/5%/3%, P<0.001) and higher day 29 residual leukemia for B-lineage (P<0.001), but not T-ALL (P=0.53). Event-free survival rates (pEFS5y) were 89+/-1% (A), 80+/-3% (B) and 74+/-4% (C) with significant differences only for non-high risk groups. Except for thrombosis, pancreatitis and osteonecrosis, the risk of 19 specified toxicities was not enhanced by age above 10 years. In conclusion, a pediatric-based protocol is tolerable and effective for young adults, despite their increased frequency of higher risk features.","['Toft, N', 'Birgens, H', 'Abrahamsson, J', 'Griskevicius, L', 'Hallbook, H', 'Heyman, M', 'Klausen, T W', 'Jonsson, O G', 'Palk, K', 'Pruunsild, K', 'Quist-Paulsen, P', 'Vaitkeviciene, G', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Asberg, A', 'Frandsen, T L', 'Marquart, H V', 'Madsen, H O', 'Noren-Nystrom, U', 'Schmiegelow, K']","['Toft N', 'Birgens H', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Griskevicius L', 'Hallbook H', 'Heyman M', 'Klausen TW', 'Jonsson OG', 'Palk K', 'Pruunsild K', 'Quist-Paulsen P', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Vettenranta K', 'Asberg A', 'Frandsen TL', 'Marquart HV', 'Madsen HO', 'Noren-Nystrom U', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Hematology, Herlev University Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Herlev University Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska Institute, Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Hematology, Herlev University Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.', ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", 'Department of Hematology, North Estonia Medical Centre, Tallinn, Estonia.', ""Tallinn Children's Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia."", ""Department of Hematology, St. Olav's Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway."", ""Centre for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Olav's Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Section 7631, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Section 7631, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170818,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/08/19 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2017/08/19 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017265 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.265 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Mar;32(3):606-615. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.265.

We here identify interleukin 4 (IL4) as a selective inhibitor of AML cell growth and survival in a cytokine screen using fluorescently labeled AML cells. RNA-sequencing of the AML cells revealed an IL4-induced upregulation of Stat6 target genes and enrichment of apoptosis-related gene expression signatures. Consistent with these findings, we found that IL4 stimulation of AML cells induced Stat6 phosphorylation and that disruption of Stat6 using CRISPR/Cas9-genetic engineering rendered cells partially resistant to IL4-induced apoptosis. To evaluate whether IL4 inhibits AML cells in vivo, we expressed IL4 ectopically in AML cells transplanted into mice and also injected IL4 into leukemic mice; both strategies resulted in the suppression of the leukemia cell burden and increased survival. Notably, IL4 exposure caused reduced growth and survival of primary AML CD34(+)CD38(-) patient cells from several genetic subtypes of AML, whereas normal stem and progenitor cells were less affected. The IL4-induced apoptosis of AML cells was linked to Caspase-3 activation. Our results demonstrate that IL4 selectively induces apoptosis of AML cells in a Stat6-dependent manner-findings that may translate into new therapeutic opportunities in AML.","['Pena-Martinez, P', 'Eriksson, M', 'Ramakrishnan, R', 'Chapellier, M', 'Hogberg, C', 'Orsmark-Pietras, C', 'Richter, J', 'Andersson, A', 'Fioretos, T', 'Jaras, M']","['Pena-Martinez P', 'Eriksson M', 'Ramakrishnan R', 'Chapellier M', 'Hogberg C', 'Orsmark-Pietras C', 'Richter J', 'Andersson A', 'Fioretos T', 'Jaras M']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170818,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/08/19 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2017/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017261 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.261 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Mar;32(3):588-596. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.261.

We extend our studies here to two additional B-ALL cell lines, BCR-ABL1-negative CCRF-SB and p210 BCR-ABL1-positive NAML1. Givinostat induced significant cell growth inhibition in both cell lines, with an IC50 of 0.65+/-0.052muM and 0.25+/-0.028muM in CCRF-SB and NAML1, respectively. The key signal protein of the BCR-ABL1, Crk-L1, was significantly reduced by givinostat treatment in NAML1.

The objective was to evaluate whether children and adolescents with cancer benefited from the Orphan Drug Regulation. METHODS: Data on orphan drug designations (ODDs) and registered orphan drugs from 8th August 2000 to 10th September 2016 were collected from the Community Register of medicinal products for human use. Assessment history, product information and existence of paediatric investigation plans were searched and retrieved from the European Medicine Agency website. RESULTS: Over 16 years, 272 of 657 oncology ODDs (41%) concerned a malignant condition occurring both in adults and children. The five most common were acute myeloid leukaemia, high-grade glioma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, graft-versus-host disease and soft-tissue sarcomas. 74% of 31 marketing authorisations (MAs) for an indication both in adults and children (26 medicines) had no information for paediatric use in their Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) at the time of the first MA. Furthermore, 68% still have no paediatric information in their most recently updated SmPC, at a median of 7 years after. Only 15 ODDs (2%) pertained to a malignancy occurring specifically in children and only two drugs received an MA: Unituxin for high-risk neuroblastoma and Votubia for sub-ependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. CONCLUSION: The Orphan Drug Regulation failed to promote the development of innovative therapies for malignancies occurring in children. Major delays and waivers occurred through the application of the Paediatric Medicines Regulation. The European regulatory environment needs to be improved to accelerate innovation for children and adolescents dying of cancer.","['Vassal, Gilles', 'Kearns, Pam', 'Blanc, Patricia', 'Scobie, Nicole', 'Heenen, Delphine', 'Pearson, Andy']","['Vassal G', 'Kearns P', 'Blanc P', 'Scobie N', 'Heenen D', 'Pearson A']","['Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, Paris-Sud University, Paris, France; Innovative Therapy for Children with Cancer, Villejuif, France.

Cancer incident cases and cancer deaths in 2013 were analyzed. METHODS: Through the procedure of quality control, reported data from 255 registries were accepted to establish the national database for cancer estimates. Incidences and mortalities were calculated with stratification by area (urban/rural), sex (male/female), age group (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14 ... 80-84, and 85-year-old and above), and cancer site. The structure of Segi's population was used for the calculation of age-standardized rates (ASR). Top 10 most common cancers and leading causes of cancer deaths were listed. RESULTS: In 2013, 3,682,200 new cancer cases and 2,229,300 cancer deaths were estimated in China based on the pooled data from 255 cancer registries, covering 16.65% of the national population. The incidence was 270.59/100,000, with an ASR of 186.15/100,000; the mortality was 166.83/100,000, with an ASR of 108.94/100,000. The top 10 most common cancer sites were the lung, stomach, liver, colorectum, female breast, esophagus, thyroid, cervix, brain, and pancreas. The ten leading causes of cancer deaths were lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, female breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, and lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer leaves serious disease burden in China with high incidence and mortality. Lung cancer was the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in China. Efficient control strategy is needed, especially for major cancers.","['Zheng, Rongshou', 'Zeng, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Siwei', 'Chen, Wanqing']","['Zheng R', 'Zeng H', 'Zhang S', 'Chen W']","['National Central Cancer Registry, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100021, P.

However, the broad adaptation of the methodology into the clinic is still hampered by inconsistent results from different RNA-seq protocols and involves further evaluation of its analytical reliability using patient samples. Here, we applied two commonly used RNA-seq library preparation protocols to samples from acute leukemia patients to understand how poly-A-tailed mRNA selection (PA) and ribo-depletion (RD) based RNA-seq library preparation protocols affect gene fusion detection, variant calling, and gene expression profiling. RESULTS: Overall, the protocols produced similar results with consistent outcomes. Nevertheless, the PA protocol was more efficient in quantifying expression of leukemia marker genes and showed better performance in the expression-based classification of leukemia. Independent qRT-PCR experiments verified that the PA protocol better represented total RNA compared to the RD protocol. In contrast, the RD protocol detected a higher number of non-coding RNA features and had better alignment efficiency. The RD protocol also recovered more known fusion-gene events, although variability was seen in fusion gene predictions. CONCLUSION: The overall findings provide a framework for the use of RNA-seq in a precision medicine setting with limited number of samples and suggest that selection of the library preparation protocol should be based on the objectives of the analysis.","['Kumar, Ashwini', 'Kankainen, Matti', 'Parsons, Alun', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Mattila, Pirkko', 'Heckman, Caroline A']","['Kumar A', 'Kankainen M', 'Parsons A', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Mattila P', 'Heckman CA']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, P.O.

We used a case-parent trio study design; unlike more commonly used case-control studies, this study design is ideal for avoiding issues with population stratification bias among this at-risk ethnic group. Using 710 individuals from 323 Guatemalan and US Hispanic families, two inherited SNPs in ARID5B reached genome-wide level significance: rs10821936, RR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.70-3.14, p = 1.7x10-8 and rs7089424, RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.64-3.01, p = 5.2x10-8.

Notably, effect sizes observed for rs7089424 and rs10821936 in our study were >20% higher than those reported among non-Hispanic white populations in previous genetic association studies. Our results confirmed the role of ARID5B in childhood ALL susceptibility among Hispanics; however, our assessment did not reveal any strong novel inherited genetic risks for acute lymphoblastic

After allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), the opportunity for NK cell activation can occur both in human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matched and HLA mismatched pairs. Although less well explored in HLA identical transplants, many studies confirm the importance of NK KIR mismatching in the graft-versus-leukemia effect in haploidentical (haplo) SCT and this has stimulated recent research to better define the role of NK mismatching on transplant outcome. In this review, we describe recent progress in identifying favorable and unfavorable NK matching in SCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies focus less on KIR-HLA mismatching and more on KIR genes as tools to predict alloreactivity via NK licensing and activating KIR. SUMMARY: Current results show that transplant outcomes could be improved by judicious selection of favorable donors.","['Stringaris, Kate', 'Barrett, Austin J']","['Stringaris K', 'Barrett AJ']","['aLaboratory of Transplantation Immunotherapy bStem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Allografts', 'Animals', 'Donor Selection/*methods', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, KIR/*immunology']",,,2017/08/18 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000384 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Nov;24(6):489-495. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000384.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the anticancer effects and mechanism of digoxin in leukemia is largely unknown. Her, our data show that digoxin treatment significantly inhibits leukemia cell viability. In addition, digoxin treatment significantly induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in leukemia cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that digoxin treatment inactivate that oncogenic pathway Akt/mTOR signaling in leukemia cells. In addition, our data show that digoxin treatment induces activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling in leukemia cells. Interestingly, our in vitro and in vivo experiments show that combination treatment of digoxin and UPR inhibitor can synergistically suppress leukemia growth and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest compared to single drug treatment. In summary, our findings indicate that digoxin has potential anticancer effects on leukemia. The combination of digoxin and UPR signaling inhibitor can exerts synergistic anticancer activity against leukemia.

The effectiveness and safety of IV infusion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched lymphocytes for leukemia, and intrathecal (IT) infusion of HLA-mismatched lymphocytes for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dissemination of medulloblastoma have been reported. A 13-year-old girl (HLA-A31) was diagnosed as relapsing from Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemia in the CNS after receiving chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from her father (HLA-A31), and craniospinal irradiation. We performed an IT infusion of haploidentical lymphocytes from her mother. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from her mother (HLA-A31) were administered by IT infusion weekly. Examination of CSF 1 week after first IT showed that lymphocyte counts had increased markedly and the breakpoint cluster region/abelson-bearing cells had disappeared. Furthermore, CD3 T cells in the CSF were negative for HLA-A31, and expressed high HLA-DR. These results indicate the infused non-HSCT-donor lymphocytes did not survive, and that the HSCT donor(father)-derived lymphocytes migrated to the CSF and were activated. The patient showed partial remission for 2 months following this therapy. Serious adverse reactions and graft versus host disease were not observed. To control leukemic CNS dissemination, haploidentical nondonor lymphocytes might contribute to a graft versus leukemia effect.","['Mayumi, Azusa', 'Sawada, Akihisa', 'Ioi, Aya', 'Higuchi, Kohei', 'Shimizu, Mariko', 'Sato, Maho', 'Yasui, Masahiro', 'Inoue, Masami']","['Mayumi A', 'Sawada A', 'Ioi A', 'Higuchi K', 'Shimizu M', 'Sato M', 'Yasui M', 'Inoue M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*transplantation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy']",,,2017/08/18 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000937 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Mar;40(2):e129-e132. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000937.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the safety of AFP with voriconazole (VRC) in pediatric hematology/oncology patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of VRC AFP in children with malignancies hospitalized in all 7 Greek pediatric hematology/oncology centers during 2008 to 2012 was conducted. Patients' demographics, outcome, and adverse event (AE) data were recorded. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-nine VRC AFP courses in 249 patients (median age 6 y, 55% boys) were studied. The most common underlying diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (51%), non Hodgkin lymphoma (8.6%), and acute myeloid leukemia (7.7%). The median number of VRC courses per patient was 1.7, whereas the median VRC dose was 7 mg/kg (range, 5 to 7 mg/kg) every 12 hours. During the last 2 weeks before AFP, 51% of the patients had received corticosteroids, 43% suffered from severe neutropenia, and 17.3% from mucositis. The median duration of VRC AFP was 17 days (range, 1 to 31 d). A single breakthrough fungemia due to Candida glabrata was recorded. Only 1 patient died due to the underlying disease. The most common AEs reported in 70/429 (16.3%) courses with >/=1 AE were elevated liver enzymes (50%), hypokalemia (24.3%), and ophthalmological disorders (14.3%). The median time of AE onset was 5 days (range, 1 to 21 d). Among 70 AEs reported, 38.5%, 48.4%, and 12.8% were of grade I, II, and III, respectively.

Here, we investigated whether the contact phase system of coagulation is activated and may regulate inflammatory responses in human lungs. Components of the contact phase system were characterized in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from 54 ARDS patients and 43 controls, and their impact on cytokine/chemokine expression in human precision cut lung slices (PCLS) was assessed by a PCR array. Activation of the contact system, associated with high levels of coagulation factor XIIa (Hageman factor, FXIIa), plasma kallikrein and bradykinin, occurred rapidly in ARDS lungs after the onset of the disease and virtually normalized within one week from time of diagnosis. FXII levels in BALF were higher in ARDS non-survivors than survivors and were positively correlated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha concentration. FXII induced the production and release of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1beta, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), CXCL5 and TNF-alpha in human PCLS in a kallikrein-kinin-independent manner. In conclusion, accumulation of FXII in ARDS lungs may contribute to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and is associated with clinical outcome. FXII inhibition may thus offer a novel and promising therapeutic approach to antagonize overwhelming inflammatory responses in ARDS lungs without interfering with vital haemostasis.","['Hess, Rosanna', 'Wujak, Lukasz', 'Hesse, Christina', 'Sewald, Katherina', 'Jonigk, Danny', 'Warnecke, Gregor', 'Fieguth, Hans-Gerd', 'de Maat, Steven', 'Maas, Coen', 'Bonella, Francesco', 'Preissner, Klaus T', 'Weiss, Benjamin', 'Schaefer, Liliana', 'Kuebler, Wolfgang M', 'Markart, Philipp', 'Wygrecka, Malgorzata']","['Hess R', 'Wujak L', 'Hesse C', 'Sewald K', 'Jonigk D', 'Warnecke G', 'Fieguth HG', 'de Maat S', 'Maas C', 'Bonella F', 'Preissner KT', 'Weiss B', 'Schaefer L', 'Kuebler WM', 'Markart P', 'Wygrecka M']","['Malgorzata Wygrecka, PhD, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine,, Universities of Giessen and Marburg Lung Center, Friedrichstrasse 24, 35392 Giessen, Germany, Tel.: +49 641 99 47482, Fax: +49 641 99 47509, E-mail: malgorzata.wygrecka@innere.med.uni-giessen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170817,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '9001-30-3 (Factor XII)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Coagulation', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Factor XII/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Lung/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/blood/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/blood/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute respiratory distress syndrome', '*coagulation factor XII', '*contact phase system']",2017/08/18 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['16-12-0904 [pii]', '10.1160/TH16-12-0904 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2017 Oct 5;117(10):1896-1907. doi: 10.1160/TH16-12-0904.

Here, we provide evidence that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts remodel the BM niche into a leukemia growth-permissive and normal hematopoiesis-suppressive microenvironment through exosome secretion. Either engrafted AML cells or AML-derived exosomes increased mesenchymal stromal progenitors and blocked osteolineage development and bone formation in vivo. Preconditioning with AML-derived exosomes 'primed' the animals for accelerated AML growth. Conversely, disruption of exosome secretion in AML cells through targeting Rab27a, an important regulator involved in exosome release, significantly delayed leukemia development. In BM stromal cells, AML-derived exosomes induced the expression of DKK1, a suppressor of normal hematopoiesis and osteogenesis, thereby contributing to osteoblast loss. Conversely, treatment with a DKK1 inhibitor delayed AML progression and prolonged survival in AML-engrafted mice. In addition, AML-derived exosomes induced a broad downregulation of hematopoietic stem cell-supporting factors (for example, CXCL12, KITL and IGF1) in BM stromal cells and reduced their ability to support normal hematopoiesis. Altogether, this study uncovers novel features of AML pathogenesis and unveils how AML cells create a self-strengthening leukemic niche that promotes leukemic cell proliferation and survival, while suppressing normal hematopoiesis through exosome secretion.","['Kumar, B', 'Garcia, M', 'Weng, L', 'Jung, X', 'Murakami, J L', 'Hu, X', 'McDonald, T', 'Lin, A', 'Kumar, A R', 'DiGiusto, D L', 'Stein,

The consequent long-term psychological burden requires long-term follow up suited to the anxieties and needs of CCS, hence the need for the present survey. METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire survey at medical facilities in the Chugoku and Shikoku regions of Japan with CCS who had survived for at least 5 years following treatment, and their family members. RESULTS: A total of 30 CCS (53%) and 27 CCS family members (47%) answered the questionnaires. The median age of the CCS and their family members (CCS parents) was 23 years and 51.5 years, respectively. The most common diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (47%) and the median length of follow up after the conclusion of treatment was 11 years. The percentage of participants who responded that they knew about late effects was significantly lower among CCS than among CCS parents. Almost no significant difference was observed between CCS and CCS parents regarding anxieties at specific life stages. The main consultants for CCS and CCS parents were their family, but they sought opportunities for casual consultation for current worries outside the family. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary for medical facilities not only to provide medical support, but also to establish a place where they can provide centralized consultation for the anxieties of CCS and their parents.","['Iwai, Naoko', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Iwai, Atsushi', 'Yamaguchi, Sonoe', 'Tsukahara, Hirokazu', 'Oda, Megumi']","['Iwai N', 'Shimada A', 'Iwai A', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Tsukahara H', 'Oda M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Density, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Science, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Density, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Science, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Deparment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/*epidemiology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['anxiety', 'childhood cancer', 'consultation', 'family care', 'survivor']",2017/08/18 06:00,2018/06/19 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13390 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2017 Nov;59(11):1140-1150. doi: 10.1111/ped.13390.,,['(c) 2017 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7635-5209', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5207-3779']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIMPLICITY (NCT01244750) is an observational study exploring tyrosine kinase inhibitor use and management patterns in patients with CP-CML receiving first-line imatinib (n = 416), dasatinib (n = 418) or nilotinib (n = 408) in the US and 6 European countries in routine clinical practice. Twelve-month follow-up data of 1242 prospective patients (enrolled October 01 2010-September 02 2015) are reported. 81% of patients had baseline comorbidities. Treatment selection was based on perceived efficacy over patient comorbidity profile. There was a predominance of imatinib-treated patients enrolled earlier in the study, with subsequent shift toward dasatinib- and nilotinib-treated patients by 2013/2014. Monitoring for either CyR/MR improved over time and was documented for 36%, 82%, and 95% of patients by 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively; 5% had no documentation of CyR/MR monitoring during the first year of therapy. Documentation of MR/CyR testing was higher in Europe than the US (P < .001) and at academic versus community practices (P = .001). Age <65 years, patients being followed at sites within Europe, those followed at academic centers and patients no longer on first-line therapy were more likely to be monitored by 12 months. SIMPLICITY demonstrates that the NCCN and ELN recommendations on response monitoring have not been consistently translated into routine clinical practice. In the absence of appropriate monitoring practices, clinical response to TKI therapy cannot be established, any needed changes to treatment strategy will thus not be implemented, and long-term patient outcomes are likely to be impacted.","['Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Paquette, Ron L', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Zyczynski, Teresa', 'Foreman, Aimee', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Andorsky, David', 'Beeker, Aart', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Hansen, Richard', 'Lomaia, Elza', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Mauro, Michael J']","['Goldberg SL', 'Cortes JE', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Hehlmann R', 'Khoury HJ', 'Michallet M', 'Paquette RL', 'Simonsson B', 'Zyczynski T', 'Foreman A', 'Abruzzese E', 'Andorsky D', 'Beeker A', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Hansen R', 'Lomaia E', 'Olavarria E', 'Mauro MJ']","['John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'University of Milano Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-Benite, France.', 'UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Uppsala Universitet, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey.', 'ICON plc, San Francisco, California.', 'S.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in the progression of cancer invasion and metastasis in an inflammatory microenvironment. B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 (BMI-1) acts as an oncogene in various tumors. Ectopic expression of Bmi-1 have an effect on EMT and invasiveness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of BMI-1 on inflammation-induced tumor migration and EMT and the underlying mechanism. We observed that the expression of BMI-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta was significantly increased in HT29 and HCT116 cells after THP-1 Conditioned-Medium (THP-1-CM) stimulation. Additionally, inhibition of BMI-1 impeded cell invasion induced by THP-1-CM-stimulation in both HT29 and HCT116 cells. BMI-1 knockdown remarkably repressed THP-1-CM-induced EMT by regulating the expression of EMT biomarkers with an increase in E-cadherin accompanied by decrease in N-cadherin and vimentin. Furthermore, downregulation of BMI-1 dramatically impeded THP-1-CM-triggered Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4)/myeloid differentiation protein 2(MD-2)/myeloid differentiation factor 88(MyD88) activity by repressing the expression of the TLR4/MD-2 complex and MyD88. Further data demonstrated that knockout of BMI-1 also dampened NF-kappaB THP-1-CM-triggered activity. Taken all data together, our findings established that BMI-1 modulated TLR4/MD-2/MyD88 complex-mediated NF-kappaB signaling involved in inflammation-induced cancer cells invasion and EMT, and therefore, could be a potential chemopreventive agent against inflammation-associated colorectal cancer.

Resistance to this class of drugs represents one of the strongest indicators of poor clinical outcome. We show that leukemic cells, which are resistant to the glucocorticoid drug methylprednisolone, display a higher demand of glucose associated with a deregulation of metabolic pathways, in comparison to sensitive cells. Interestingly, a combinatorial treatment of glucocorticoid and the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose displayed a synergistic effect in methylprednisolone-resistant cells, in an oxygen tension-independent manner. Unlike solid tumors, where 2-deoxy-D-glucose promotes inhibition of glycolysis by hexokinase II exclusively under hypoxic conditions, we were able to show that the antileukemic effects of 2-deoxy-D-glucose are far more complex in leukemia. We demonstrate a hexokinase II-independent cell viability decrease and apoptosis induction of the glucose analog in leukemia. Additionally, due to the structural similarity of 2-deoxy-D-glucose with mannose, we could confirm that the mechanism by which 2-deoxy-D-glucose predominantly acts in leukemia is via modification in N-linked glycosylation, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and consequently induction of the unfolded protein response.","['Leni, Zaira', 'Cwiek, Paulina', 'Dimitrova, Valeriya', 'Dulcey, Andrea S', 'Zamboni, Nicola', 'Simillion, Cedric', 'Rossi, Geetha', 'Leibundgut, Kurt', 'Arcaro, Alexandre']","['Leni Z', 'Cwiek P', 'Dimitrova V', 'Dulcey AS', 'Zamboni N', 'Simillion C', 'Rossi G', 'Leibundgut K', 'Arcaro A']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170726,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'N762921K75 (Nitrogen)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxyglucose/*toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Hexokinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology', 'Nitrogen/chemistry', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/toxicity', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",,,2017/08/18 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/2487297 [doi]'],ppublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2017;2017:2487297. doi: 10.1155/2017/2487297.

However, they fail to completely eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSCs) due to their higher DNA repair capacity of cancer stem cells than that of bulk cancer cells, which becomes the root of drug resistance and leukemia recurrence. A new strategy to eliminate LSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is therefore urgently needed. RESULTS: We report that a low-dose chidamide, a novel orally active benzamide-type histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which selectively targets HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 10, could enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents (daunorubicin, idarubicin, and cytarabine) in CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1alpha cells, CD34(+)CD38(-) Kasumi cells, and primary refractory or relapsed AML CD34(+) cells, reflected by the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and increase of cell cycle arrest in vitro. Mechanistically, these events were associated with DNA damage accumulation and repair defects. Co-treatment with chidamide and the DNA-damaging agent IDA gave rise to the production of gammaH2A.X and inhibited posttranslationally but not transcriptionally the repair gene of ATM, BRCA1, and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and 2 (CHK2) phosphorylation. Finally, the combination of chidamide and IDA initiated caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, but not caspase-8 and caspase-9, and ultimately induced CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1alpha cell apoptosis. Further analysis of AML patients' clinical characteristics revealed that the ex vivo efficacy of chidamide in combination with IDA in primary CD34(+) samples was significantly correlated to peripheral blood WBC counts at diagnosis, while LDH levels and karyotype status had no effect, indicating that the combination regimen of chidamide and IDA could rapidly diminish tumor burden in patients with R/R AML. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preclinical evidence for low-dose chidamide in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in treating recurrent/resistant AML as an alternative salvage regimen, especially those possessing stem and progenitor cells.","['Li, Yin', 'Wang, Yan', 'Zhou, Yong', 'Li, Jie', 'Chen, Kai', 'Zhang, Leisi', 'Deng, Manman', 'Deng, Suqi', 'Li, Peng', 'Xu, Bing']","['Li Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Li J', 'Chen K', 'Zhang L', 'Deng M', 'Deng S', 'Li P', 'Xu B']","[""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361003 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361003 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515 People's Republic of China."", ""Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361003 People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170814,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '87CIC980Y0', '(N-(2-amino-5-fluorobenzyl)-4-(N-(pyridine-3-acrylyl)aminomethyl)benzamide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Chidamide', '*DNA damage', '*Drug resistance', '*Leukemia stem and progenitor cells']",2017/08/18 06:00,2018/05/03 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-017-0377-8 [doi]', '377 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2017 Aug 14;9:83. doi: 10.1186/s13148-017-0377-8. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5556349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antiproliferative activities of the compounds (9b-9n, 10) were evaluated on various cancer cell lines including, MCF-7 breast, HL-60 leukemia, MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic, DU145 prostate, HeLa cervical and CaCo-2 colon, as well as normal human MCF10A mammary epithelial and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by MTT assay. Compounds (9b-9n, 10) exhibited considerable antiproliferative effects against cancer cells with IC50 range of 4.43 +/- 0.35 to 49.63 +/- 3.59 microM, but they are less cytotoxic on normal cells (IC50 > 100 microM). Among all the compounds, 9f showed substantial antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and HL-60 cells with IC50 of 6.13 +/- 0.64 and 4.43 +/- 0.35, respectively. Further mechanistic studies of 9f were carried out on MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines. 9f caused arrest of cell cycle of MCF-7 and HL-60 cells at G0/G1 phase. Apoptotic population elevation, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, increase of cytosolic cytochrome c and Bax levels, decrease of Bcl-2 levels and enhanced caspases-9 and -3 activities were observed in 9f-treated MCF-7 and HL-60 cells. These results demonstrate anticancer and apoptosis-inducing potentials of 9f in MCF-7 and HL-60 cells via intrinsic pathway.","['Rayavarapu, Srinuvasarao', 'Yarla, Nagendra Sastry', 'Kadiri, Sunanda Kumari', 'Bishayee, Anupam', 'Vidavalur, Siddaiah', 'Tadikonda, Ramu', 'Basha, Mahaboob', 'Pidugu, Vijaya Rao', 'Dowluru, Kaladhar S V G K', 'Lakappa, Dhananjaya Bhadrapura', 'Kamal, Mohammad A', 'Md Ashraf, Ghulam', 'Tarasov, Vadim V', 'Chubarev, Vladimir N', 'Klochkov, Sergey G', 'Barreto, George E', 'Bachurin, Sergey O', 'Aliev, Gjumrakch']","['Rayavarapu S', 'Yarla NS', 'Kadiri SK', 'Bishayee A', 'Vidavalur S', 'Tadikonda R', 'Basha M', 'Pidugu VR', 'Dowluru KSVGK', 'Lakappa DB', 'Kamal MA', 'Md Ashraf G', 'Tarasov VV', 'Chubarev VN', 'Klochkov SG', 'Barreto GE', 'Bachurin SO', 'Aliev G']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, Foods, Drugs and Water, College of Science and Technology, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, 530 003, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Institute of Science, GITAM University, Visakhapatnam, 530 045, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Animal Biology, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, 500 046, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, College of Science and Technology, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, 530 003, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Larkin Health Sciences Institute, Miami, FL, 33169, USA.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Foods, Drugs and Water, College of Science and Technology, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, 530 003, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Foods, Drugs and Water, College of Science and Technology, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, 530 003, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Foods, Drugs and Water, College of Science and Technology, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, 530 003, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Excelra Knowledge Solutions Private Limited, NSL SEZ ARENA, IDA Uppal, Hyderabad, 500 039, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Bioinformatics, Bilaspur University, Bilaspur, 495 001, Chhattisgarh, India.', 'Toxinology/Toxicology and Drug Discovery Unit, Center for Emerging Technologies, Jain Global Campus, Jain University, Kanakapura Taluk, Ramanagara, 562 112, Karnataka, India.', 'Enzymoics and Novel Global Community Educational Foundation, Hebersham, NSW, Australia.', 'King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Translational Medicine, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, 119991, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Translational Medicine, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, 119991, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Severniy Proezd, Chernogolovka, Moscow Region, 1142432, Russia.', 'Departamento de Nutricion y Bioquimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, D.

While MTGs were originally identified in chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemia, recent studies have uncovered a role in intestinal biology. For example, Mtg16-/- mice have increased intestinal proliferation and are more sensitive to intestinal injury in colitis models. MTG16 is also underexpressed in patients with moderate/severe ulcerative colitis. Based on these findings, we postulated that MTG16 might protect against colitis-associated carcinogenesis. MTG16 was downregulated at the protein and RNA levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in those with colitis-associated carcinoma. Mtg16-/- mice subjected to inflammatory carcinogenesis modeling exhibited worse colitis and increased tumor multiplicity and size. Loss of MTG16 also increased severity of dysplasia, apoptosis, proliferation, DNA damage, and WNT signaling. Moreover, transplantation of WT marrow into Mtg16-/- mice failed to rescue the Mtg16-/- protumorigenic phenotypes, indicating an epithelium-specific role for MTG16. While MTG dysfunction is widely appreciated in hematopoietic malignancies, the role of this gene family in epithelial homeostasis, and in colon cancer, was unrealized. This report identifies MTG16 as an important modulator of colitis and tumor development in inflammatory carcinogenesis.","['McDonough, Elizabeth M', 'Barrett, Caitlyn W', 'Parang, Bobak', 'Mittal, Mukul K', 'Smith, J Joshua', 'Bradley, Amber M', 'Choksi, Yash A', 'Coburn, Lori A', 'Short, Sarah P', 'Thompson, Joshua J', 'Zhang, Baolin', 'Poindexter, Shenika V', 'Fischer, Melissa A', 'Chen, Xi', 'Li, Jiang', 'Revetta, Frank L', 'Naik, Rishi', 'Washington, M Kay', 'Rosen, Michael J', 'Hiebert, Scott W', 'Wilson, Keith T', 'Williams, Christopher S']","['McDonough EM', 'Barrett CW', 'Parang B', 'Mittal MK', 'Smith JJ', 'Bradley AM', 'Choksi YA', 'Coburn LA', 'Short SP', 'Thompson JJ', 'Zhang B', 'Poindexter SV', 'Fischer MA', 'Chen X', 'Li J', 'Revetta FL', 'Naik R', 'Washington MK', 'Rosen MJ', 'Hiebert SW', 'Wilson KT', 'Williams CS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Surgery, and.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Program in Epithelial Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', ""Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology.', 'Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170817,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gastroenterology', 'Genetics', 'Inflammation', 'Oncology']",2017/08/18 06:00,2017/08/18 06:01,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:01 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['78210 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.78210 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2017 Aug 17;2(16). pii: 78210. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.78210. eCollection 2017 Aug 17.,"['UL1 TR000445/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007673/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA095103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK099204/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AT004821/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM062459/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX001426/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'F32 DK108492/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 DK094832/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD021630/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK080221/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007347/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX001453/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'IK2 BX002126/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'F31 CA167920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 DK096718/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5621889,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MiRNA-15b was measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. Synthesized miRNA-15b mimic and inhibitor were transfected into H9c2 cells by Lipofectamine regent. RNA expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) was examined by qRT-PCR and their protein expression was determined by western blot. Ischemia reperfusion increased miRNA-15b expression in the ischemic rat heart and resulted more severe cardiomyocytes apoptosis. In H9c2 cells, hypoxia/reoxygenation induced increased miRNA-15b expression and augmented cardiomyocyte apoptosis observed at 24 hours after 24-hour hypoxia. Compared with the vehicle group, miRNA-15b mimic further raised miRNA-15b level and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, whereas miRNA-15b inhibitor suppressed miRNA-15b expression and protected cardiomyocytes from apoptosis. Although the mRNA expression of the target genes Bcl-2 and MAPK3 was not changed significantly, the protein expression of these two genes were markedly reduced after miRNA-15b mimic treatment and significantly increased after transfected with miRNA-15b inhibitors. In conclusion, miRNA-15b deteriorates cardiomyocyte apoptosis by post-transcriptionally downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and MAPK3.","['Liu, Yaling', 'Yang, Liqun', 'Yin, Jiemin', 'Su, Diansan', 'Pan, Zhiying', 'Li, Peiying', 'Wang, Xiaodong']","['Liu Y', 'Yang L', 'Yin J', 'Su D', 'Pan Z', 'Li P', 'Wang X']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170816,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (mirn15 microRNA, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Coronary Occlusion', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Hypoxia/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/genetics/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-2', '*MAPK3', '*acute myocardial infarction', '*apoptosis', '*cardiomyocyte', '*miRNA-15b']",2017/08/18 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['jim-2017-000485 [pii]', '10.1136/jim-2017-000485 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2018 Jan;66(1):39-45. doi: 10.1136/jim-2017-000485.

Extensive work mapped the immunosuppressive activity to a highly conserved domain, termed the immunosuppressive domain (ISD), in the transmembrane (TM) subunit of the envelope glycoprotein and identified two naturally polymorphic key residues that afford immunosuppressive activity to distinct envelope glycoproteins. Concurrent mutation of these two key residues (E14R and A20F) in the envelope glycoprotein of the Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV) ISD has been reported to abolish its immunosuppressive activity, without affecting its fusogenicity, and to weaken the ability of the virus to replicate specifically in immunocompetent hosts. Here, we show that mutation of these key residues did, in fact, result in a substantial loss of F-MLV infectivity, independently of host immunity, challenging whether associations exist between the two. Notably, a loss of infectivity incurred by the F-MLV mutant with the E14R and A20F double ISD mutation was conditional on expression of the ecotropic envelope receptor murine cationic amino acid transporter-1 (mCAT1) in the virus-producing cell. Indeed, the F-MLV mutant retained infectivity when it was produced by human cells, which naturally lack mCAT1 expression, but not by murine cells. Furthermore, mCAT1 overexpression in human cells impaired the infectivity of both the F-MLV double mutant and the wild-type F-MLV strain, suggesting a finely tuned relationship between the levels of mCAT1 in the producer cell and the infectivity of the virions produced. An adverse effect on this relationship, rather than disruption of the putative ISD, is therefore more likely to explain the loss of F-MLV infectivity incurred by mutations in key ISD residues E14 and A20.IMPORTANCE Retroviruses can interact with their hosts in ways that, although not entirely understood, can greatly influence their pathogenic potential. One such example is a putative immunosuppressive activity, which has been mapped to a conserved domain of the retroviral envelope glycoprotein of several exogenous as well as endogenous retroviruses. In this study, mutations naturally found in some envelope glycoproteins lacking immunosuppressive activity were shown to affect retrovirus infectivity only if the host cell that produced the retrovirus also expressed the cellular entry receptor. These findings shed light on a novel role for this conserved domain in providing the necessary stability to the envelope glycoprotein in order to withstand the interaction with the cellular receptor during virus formation. This function of the domain is critical for further elucidation of the mechanism of immunosuppression mediated by the retroviral envelope glycoprotein.","['Eksmond, Urszula', 'Jenkins, Bryony', 'Merkenschlager, Julia', 'Mothes, Walther', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Eksmond U', 'Jenkins B', 'Merkenschlager J', 'Mothes W', 'Stoye JP', 'Kassiotis G']","['Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom jonathan.stoye@crick.ac.uk george.kassiotis@crick.ac.uk.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom jonathan.stoye@crick.ac.uk george.kassiotis@crick.ac.uk.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171013,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutation', 'Protein Domains', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Sequence Homology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*envelope glycoprotein', '*immunosuppressive domain', '*infectivity', '*murine leukemia virus']",2017/08/18 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01152-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01152-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Oct 13;91(21). pii: JVI.01152-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01152-17.

All licenced commercial male airline pilots were followed from 1955 to 2015, ever or never employed at airline with international routes. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated and relative risk by Poisson regression, to examine exposure-response relation. RESULTS: Eighty three cancers were registered compared with 92 expected; standardized incidence ratios were 0.90 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.11) for all cancers, 3.31 (95% CI 1.33 to 6.81) for malignant melanoma, and 2.49 (95% CI 1.69 to 3.54), for basal cell carcinoma of skin. The risk for all cancers, malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, basal cell carcinoma of skin, and basal cell carcinoma of trunk increased with an increase in number of employment years, cumulative air hours, total cumulative radiation dose, and cumulative radiation dose sustained up to age of 40 years. The relative risk for the highest exposure categories of cumulative radiation dose were 2.42 (95% CI 1.50 to 3.92) for all cancers, 2.57 (95% CI 1.18 to 5.56) for prostate cancer, 9.88 (95% CI 1.57 to 190.78) for malignant melanoma, 3.61 (95% CI 1.64 to 8.48) for all basal cell carcinoma, and 6.65 (95% CI 1.61 to 44.64) for basal cell carcinoma of trunk. CONCLUSIONS: This study was underpowered to study brain cancer and leukaemia risk. Basal cell carcinoma of skin is radiation-related cancer, and may be attributed to cosmic radiation. Further studies are needed to clarify the risk of cancers in association with cosmic radiation, other workplace exposure, host factors, and leisure sun-exposure, as clothes, and glass in cockpit windows shield pilots from the most potent ultraviolet-radiation.","['Gudmundsdottir, Eva Maria', 'Hrafnkelsson, Jon', 'Rafnsson, Vilhjalmur']","['Gudmundsdottir EM', 'Hrafnkelsson J', 'Rafnsson V']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland. emg5@hi.is.', 'Department of Oncology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170816,England,Environ Health,Environmental health : a global access science source,101147645,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aircraft', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pilots/*statistics & numerical data', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk', 'Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Aircrew', '*Basal cell carcinoma of skin', '*Cancer registry', '*Cosmic radiation', '*Malignant melanoma', '*Prostate cancer']",2017/08/18 06:00,2017/11/07 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12940-017-0295-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12940-017-0295-4 [pii]']",epublish,Environ Health. 2017 Aug 16;16(1):86. doi: 10.1186/s12940-017-0295-4.,,,,PMC5559846,,,['Environ Health. 2017 Nov 17;16(1):125.

Transplant practitioners must vigilantly monitor for drug interactions especially involving immunosuppressants. We report a hematopoietic cell transplant patient receiving sirolimus who developed supratherapeutic serum concentrations after initiating mirabegron. SUMMARY: A 31-year-old, 98 kg female received a second umbilical cord blood transplant four years after the first transplant for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. Mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus were utilized for graft versus host disease prophylaxis. The patient was receiving sirolimus 2 mg daily and the serum concentration on day 26 post-transplant (day + 26) was within therapeutic range (6.7 mug/L, goal range 3-12 mug/L). Her post-transplant course was complicated by BK viruria-associated cystitis for which she was started on mirabegron. Six days after starting the new medication (day + 33), the sirolimus serum concentration increased to 19.2 mug/L. Thus mirabegron was discontinued and sirolimus was held. Sirolimus was restarted once the serum concentration was within goal and subsequently stabilized with a combination of 1 mg and 2 mg daily for a total weekly dose of 10 mg. The proposed mechanisms of interaction include: (1) sirolimus inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide leading to increased mirabegron in the intestinal lumen; (2) mirabegron inhibition of P-glycoprotein leading to increased absorption of sirolimus and; (3) increased sirolimus absorption leading to increased sirolimus serum concentrations. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a potential drug interaction between sirolimus and mirabegron. Transplant specialists should be aware of this potential interaction when considering the concurrent use of these medications.","['Engle, Jeff A', 'Fair, Christina']","['Engle JA', 'Fair C']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170817,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Acetanilides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'MVR3JL3B2V (mirabegron)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Acetanilides/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Adult', 'Drug Interactions/physiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*blood/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*trends', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*blood']",['NOTNLM'],"['Sirolimus', 'drug interaction', 'hematopoietic cell transplant', 'mirabegron']",2017/08/18 06:00,2019/01/01 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217726161 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2018 Dec;24(8):627-631. doi: 10.1177/1078155217726161.

In particular, patients defined as high-risk, according to the 2017 European Leukemia Net recommendations, represent a subgroup with poor response to current therapies that are frequently associated with high-grade toxicity and potentially fatal complications. Areas covered: Preliminary results from an ongoing phase III clinical trial suggest that CPX-351 could represent an interesting treatment option in both induction and 'bridge-to-transplant' settings. In particular, 60- to 75-year-old patients with secondary AML, when treated with CPX-351, exhibit superior overall survival (HR = 0.69; P = 0.005; median OS 9.56 vs. 5.95 months), event free survival (HR = 0.74; P = 0.021), and composite response rate (47.7% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.016) as compared to standard '7 + 3' therapy. Herein, we detail the main pharmacological features of CPX-351 and review updated results of clinical trials investigating its employment in AML. Expert commentary: Novel liposome-based drugs display a high therapeutic index and represent a promising alternative to unencapsulated drugs, especially when high-risk features complicate the use of standard treatments. Further efforts in both understanding AML biology and improving nanodrug design are needed.","['Brunetti, Claudia', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Brunetti C', 'Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']","['a Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation , University of Bari , Bari , Italy.', 'a Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation , University of Bari , Bari , Italy.', 'a Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation , University of Bari , Bari , Italy.', 'a Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation , University of Bari , Bari , Italy.', 'a Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation , University of Bari , Bari , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170824,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Discovery', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Nanomedicine', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CPX-351', '*cytarabine', '*daunorubicin', '*drug delivery', '*liposome', '*nanomedicine', '*nanoparticles']",2017/08/18 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/08/18 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1369400 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Oct;10(10):853-862. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1369400.

The underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The role of autophagy and mitochondrial signaling was investigated in nilotinib-treated cardiac H9C2 cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was assessed using Cell Death Detection kit. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence staining was performed, and cathepsin B and caspase3 activity was assessed in nilotinib-treated H9C2 cells with or without distinct pathway inhibitor or specific siRNA. RESULTS: Nilotinib time- and dose-dependently induced H9C2 apoptosis, which was not completely prevented by the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Following nilotinib treatment, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased significantly accompanied with remarkable morphological changes. Nuclear translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and increased p53 was detected in nilotinib-treated cells. AIF knockdown prevented nilotinib-induced increase of p53 and apoptosis. Additionally, increased cathepsin B activity was detected, and inhibition of cathepsin B by CA-074Me prevented nilotinib-induced apoptosis and nuclear translocation of AIF. Moreover, increased Atg5 and transition of LC3-I to LC3-II was revealed following nilotinib treatment. Increased cathepsin B activity and apoptosis by nilotinib was significantly prohibited by specific autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A and Atg5 knockdown. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that nilotinib increases autophagy and cathepsin B activity, leading to mitochondrial AIF release and nuclear translocation, which is responsible for p53 and apoptosis induction in H9C2 cells.","['Yang, Qinghui', 'Zhang, Chunhui', 'Wei, Hong', 'Meng, Zenghui', 'Li, Guangnan', 'Xu, Yuanyuan', 'Chen, Yanjun']","['Yang Q', 'Zhang C', 'Wei H', 'Meng Z', 'Li G', 'Xu Y', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Cardiology, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170815,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (CA 074 methyl ester)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (LC3 protein, rat)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '116764-51-3 (bafilomycin A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Caspases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cathepsin B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*toxicity', 'RNA Interference', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AIF', 'Apoptosis', 'Atg5', 'Autophagy', 'Cathepsin B', 'H9c2', 'LC3', 'Mitochondria']",2017/08/17 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['000479993 [pii]', '10.1159/000479993 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;42(6):2182-2193. doi: 10.1159/000479993.

However, its role in macrophages remains elusive. We report that pharmacologic inhibition of GS skews M2-polarized macrophages toward the M1-like phenotype, characterized by reduced intracellular glutamine and increased succinate with enhanced glucose flux through glycolysis, which could be partly related to HIF1alpha activation. As a result of these metabolic changes and HIF1alpha accumulation, GS-inhibited macrophages display an increased capacity to induce T cell recruitment, reduced T cell suppressive potential, and an impaired ability to foster endothelial cell branching or cancer cell motility. Genetic deletion of macrophagic GS in tumor-bearing mice promotes tumor vessel pruning, vascular normalization, accumulation of cytotoxic T cells, and metastasis inhibition. These data identify GS activity as mediator of the proangiogenic, immunosuppressive, and pro-metastatic function of M2-like macrophages and highlight the possibility of targeting this enzyme in the treatment of cancer metastasis.","['Palmieri, Erika M', 'Menga, Alessio', 'Martin-Perez, Rosa', 'Quinto, Annamaria', 'Riera-Domingo, Carla', 'De Tullio, Giacoma', 'Hooper, Douglas C', 'Lamers, Wouter H', 'Ghesquiere, Bart', 'McVicar, Daniel W', 'Guarini, Attilio', 'Mazzone, Massimiliano', 'Castegna, Alessandra']","['Palmieri EM', 'Menga A', 'Martin-Perez R', 'Quinto A', 'Riera-Domingo C', 'De Tullio G', 'Hooper DC', 'Lamers WH', 'Ghesquiere B', 'McVicar DW', 'Guarini A', 'Mazzone M', 'Castegna A']","['Department of Biosciences, Biotechnologies and Biopharmaceutics, University of Bari, 70125 Bari, Italy; The Cancer and Inflammation Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Hematology Unit, National Cancer Research Center, Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II,"" 70124 Bari, Italy; Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Center for Cancer Biology (CCB), VIB, 3000 Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Center for Cancer Biology (CCB), VIB, 3000 Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hematology Unit, National Cancer Research Center, Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II,"" 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Center for Cancer Biology (CCB), VIB, 3000 Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hematology Unit, National Cancer Research Center, Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II,"" 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Department of Neurological Surgery, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy & Embryology, NUTRIM School for Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism, Maastricht University, 6211 LK Maastricht, the Netherlands; Nutrigenomics Consortium, Top Institute Food and Nutrition, Wageningen, the Netherlands; Tytgat Institute for Liver and Intestinal Research, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Metabolomics Expertise Center, Vesalius Research Center, VIB, 3000 Leuven, Belgium; Metabolomics Expertise Center, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'The Cancer and Inflammation Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Hematology Unit, National Cancer Research Center, Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II,"" 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Center for Cancer Biology (CCB), VIB, 3000 Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.

Using an unbiased algorithm to hierarchically rank genes modulated at the level of chromatin and transcription, we identified candidate regulators of mesodermal lineage determination. HOPX, a non-DNA-binding homeodomain protein, was identified as a candidate regulator of blood-forming endothelial cells. Using HOPX reporter and knockout hESCs, we show that HOPX regulates blood formation. Loss of HOPX does not impact endothelial fate specification but markedly reduces primitive hematopoiesis, acting at least in part through failure to suppress Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

Activation of mast cells by antigens is strictly dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium that involves a complex interaction between signalling molecules located within the cells. We have previously reported that tHGA, an active compound originally isolated from a local shrub known as Melicope ptelefolia, prevented IgE-mediated mast cell activation and passive systemic anaphylaxis by suppressing the release of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha from activated rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL)-2H3 cells. However, the mechanism of action (MOA) as well as the molecular target underlying the mast cell stabilising effect of tHGA has not been previously investigated. In this study, DNP-IgE-sensitised RBL-2H3 cells were pre-treated with tHGA before challenged with DNP-BSA. To dissect the MOA of tHGA in IgE-mediated mast cell activation, the effect of tHGA on the transcription of IL-4 and TNF-alpha mRNA was determined using Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) followed by Calcium Influx Assay to confirm the involvement of calcium in the activation of mast cells. The protein lysates were analysed by using Western Blot to determine the effect of tHGA on various important signalling molecules in the LAT-PLCgamma-MAPK and PI3K-NFkappaB pathways. In order to identify the molecular target of tHGA in IgE-mediated mast cell activation, the LAT and LAT2 genes in RBL-2H3 cells were knocked-down by using RNA interference to establish a LAT/LAT2 competition model. The results showed that tHGA inhibited the transcription of IL-4 and TNF-alpha as a result of the suppression of calcium influx in activated RBL-2H3 cells. The results from Western Blot revealed that tHGA primarily inhibited the LAT-PLCgamma-MAPK pathway with partial inhibition on the PI3K-p65 pathway without affecting Syk. The results from RNAi further demonstrated that tHGA failed to inhibit the release of mediators associated with mast cell degranulation under the LAT/LAT2 competition model in the absence of LAT. Collectively, this study concluded that the molecular target of tHGA could be LAT and may provide a basis for the development of a mast cell stabiliser which targets LAT.","['Tan, Ji Wei', 'Israf, Daud Ahmad', 'Md Hashim, Nur Fariesha', 'Cheah, Yoke Kqueen', 'Harith, Hanis Hazeera', 'Shaari, Khozirah', 'Tham, Chau Ling']","['Tan JW', 'Israf DA', 'Md Hashim NF', 'Cheah YK', 'Harith HH', 'Shaari K', 'Tham CL']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.

Telomeres shorten with mitotic cellular division, but are maintained in cells with high proliferative capacity by telomerase. Loss-of-function mutations in telomere-maintenance genes are genetic risk factors for cirrhosis development in humans and murine models. Telomerase deficiency provokes accelerated telomere shortening and dysfunction, facilitating genomic instability and oncogenesis. Here we examined whether telomerase mutations and telomere shortening were associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to cirrhosis. Telomere length of peripheral blood leukocytes was measured by Southern blot and qPCR in 120 patients with HCC associated with cirrhosis and 261 healthy subjects. HCC patients were screened for telomerase gene variants (in TERT and TERC) by Sanger sequencing. Age-adjusted telomere length was comparable between HCC patients and healthy subjects by both Southern blot and qPCR. Four non-synonymous TERT heterozygous variants were identified in four unrelated patients, resulting in a significantly higher mutation carrier frequency (3.3%) in patients as compared to controls (p = 0.02). Three of the four variants (T726M, A1062T, and V1090M) were previously observed in patients with other telomere diseases (severe aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and cirrhosis). A novel TERT variant, A243V, was identified in a 65-year-old male with advanced HCC and cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcohol ingestion, but direct assay measurements in vitro did not detect modulation of telomerase enzymatic activity or processivity. In summary, constitutional variants resulting in amino acid changes in the telomerase reverse transcriptase were found in a small proportion of patients with cirrhosis-associated HCC.","['Donaires, Flavia S', 'Scatena, Natalia F', 'Alves-Paiva, Raquel M', 'Podlevsky, Joshua D', 'Logeswaran, Dhenugen', 'Santana, Barbara A', 'Teixeira, Andreza C', 'Chen, Julian J-L', 'Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Martinelli, Ana L C']","['Donaires FS', 'Scatena NF', 'Alves-Paiva RM', 'Podlevsky JD', 'Logeswaran D', 'Santana BA', 'Teixeira AC', 'Chen JJ', 'Calado RT', 'Martinelli ALC']","['Department of Genetics, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Hematology and Gastroenterology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Hematology and Gastroenterology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Hematology and Gastroenterology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'School of Molecular Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America.', 'School of Molecular Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Hematology and Gastroenterology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Hematology and Gastroenterology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'School of Molecular Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Hematology and Gastroenterology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Hematology and Gastroenterology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170816,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis/*enzymology/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/08/17 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2016/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0183287 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-02940 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Aug 16;12(8):e0183287. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0183287. eCollection 2017.,['R01 GM094450/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC5558955,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aeromonas veronii has been identified as a microorganism with the potential to produce L-glutaminase, an anticancer agent effective against acute lymphocytic leukaemia. In this study, a selective medium of Aeromonas veronii was used to culture the microorganism. Strain improvement was done by adaptive and induced mutational techniques. A selective minimal agar media was incorporated for the growth of the strain which further supports adaptive mutation. Strains were also UV-irradiated and successively treated with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine to find a resilient strain capable of producing L-glutaminase efficiently. The Plackett-Burman design and central composite designs were used to screen and optimize additional carbon and nitrogen sources. Adaptive mutation resulted in promising yield improvements compared to native strain (P<0.001). The mean yield of 30 treated colonies from the induced mutation was significantly increased compared to the non-induced strain (P< 0.001). The economically feasible statistical designs were found to reinforce each other in order to maximize the yield of the enzyme. The interactions of nutrient factors were understood from the 3D response surface plots. The model was found to be a perfect fit in terms of maximizing enzyme yield, with the productivity improving at every stage to a fourfold output of enzyme (591.11 +/-7.97 IU/mL) compared to the native strain (135+/-3.51 IU/mL).","['Jesuraj, S Aravinth Vijay', 'Sarker, Md Moklesur Rahman', 'Ming, Long Chiau', 'Praya, S Marylin Jeya', 'Ravikumar, M', 'Wui, Wong Tin']","['Jesuraj SAV', 'Sarker MMR', 'Ming LC', 'Praya SMJ', 'Ravikumar M', 'Wui WT']","['Centre for Pharmaceutical Sciences, JNT University, Kukatpally, Hyderabad, Telengana State, India.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Lincoln University College, Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Lincoln University College, Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, State University of Bangladesh, Dhanmondi, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Pharmacy, School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy, KPJ Healthcare University College, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Lincoln University College, Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Geethanjali College of Pharmacy, Cheerial, Keesara, Telengana, India.', 'Non-Destructive Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Research Centre, iPROMISE, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Puncak alam, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170816,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",IM,"['*Adaptation, Biological', 'Aeromonas veronii/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Glutaminase/*biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Mutation']",,,2017/08/17 06:00,2017/10/19 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0181745 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-47679 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Aug 16;12(8):e0181745. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0181745. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5558970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the effects of I3C on cell cycle progression and apoptosis through activation of AhR on THP-1 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line. METHODS: MTT viability assay was used to measure the cytotoxic effects of I3C on THP-1 cells. Apoptosis and cell cycle assays were investigated using flow cytometry. Real time RT-PCR was conducted to measure the alterations in the expression of AhR gene, key genes associated with AhR activation (IL1beta and CYP1A1) and major genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis including P27, P21, CDK2, P53, BCL2 and FasR. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that I3C inhibits the proliferation of THP-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with minimal toxicity over normal monocytes. The AhR target genes (CYP1A1, IL1beta) were overexpressed upon I3C treatment (p < .05 to p < .001). The antiproliferative effects of I3C were in association with programed cell death. I3C downregulated BCL2 and upregulated FasR in THP-1 cells (p < .05 to p < .001). G1 cell cycle arrest was also observed using flow cytometry. G1-acting cell cycle genes (P21, P27 and P53) were overexpressed (p < .05 to p < .001), while CDK2 was downregulated upon I3C treatment (p < .01 to p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: I3C could exert its antileukemic effects through AhR activation which is associated with programed cell death and G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Therefore, AhR could be targeted as a novel treatment possibility in AML.","['Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Seyedhosseini, Fakhri Sadat', 'Behnampour, Nasser', 'Yazdani, Yaghoub']","['Mohammadi S', 'Seyedhosseini FS', 'Behnampour N', 'Yazdani Y']","['a Student Research Committee, Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine , Golestan University of Medical Sciences , Gorgan , Iran.', 'b Infectious Diseases Research Center and Laboratory Science Research Center , Golestan University of Medical Sciences , Gorgan , Iran.', 'c Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Health , Golestan University of Medical Sciences , Gorgan , Iran.', 'b Infectious Diseases Research Center and Laboratory Science Research Center , Golestan University of Medical Sciences , Gorgan , Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['0 (IL1B protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', 'C11E72455F (indole-3-carbinol)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-1beta/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/agonists/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'G1 cell cycle arrest', 'THP-1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'indole-3-carbinol']",2017/08/17 06:00,2018/04/28 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10799893.2017.1360351 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2017 Oct;37(5):506-514. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2017.1360351.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classifying leukemia in horses can be challenging if blasts predominate and since few antibodies to identify cell types are available. The objective of this study was to describe in detail the clinical and pathologic features of acute leukemia in horses. Twelve horses ranging from 0.2 to 25.9 years of age were diagnosed with acute leukemia. Six cases were classified as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) based on predominance of blasts, lack of granulocytic or monocytic differentiation, and detection of CD3, CD20, and/or CD79a antigens by immunohistochemistry. Six other cases were classified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelomonocytic ( n = 4), basophilic ( n = 1), and eosinophilic ( n = 1) differentiation based on > 20% bone marrow blasts and partial leukocytic differentiation. Reactivity with antibodies to Iba-1/AIF-1, CD172a, and CD163 was determined for all cases of AML. Eleven horses had thrombocytopenia, 10 had neutropenia, 8 had anemia, all had blasts on blood films, and none had leukocytosis. Ten horses had increased serum acute phase proteins. Bone marrow cellularity ranged from 30% to 100%, and the proportion of blasts ranged from 80% to 100% and 30% to 60% in ALL and AML, respectively. Horses were severely ill at diagnosis and euthanized within days or weeks. Unique features of acute leukemia in horses compared to other species were variable lymphocyte antigen expression (ALL) and frequent inflammation (ALL and AML).","['Cooper, Carina J', 'Keller, Stefan M', 'Arroyo, Luis G', 'Hewson, Joanne', 'Kenney, Daniel', 'Bienzle, Dorothee']","['Cooper CJ', 'Keller SM', 'Arroyo LG', 'Hewson J', 'Kenney D', 'Bienzle D']","['1 Department of Clinical Studies, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', '2 Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', '1 Department of Clinical Studies, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', '1 Department of Clinical Studies, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', '1 Department of Clinical Studies, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', '2 Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170816,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Horse Diseases/classification/*pathology', 'Horses', 'Leukemia/classification/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Thrombocytopenia/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD172a', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*acute lymphocytic leukemia', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*bone marrow', '*equine', '*immunohistochemistry', '*ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1/allograft inflammatory factor-1']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0300985817720983 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2018 Jan;55(1):159-172. doi: 10.1177/0300985817720983.

We hypothesized that recent survival rates could be comparable to the current standards and performed a population-based analysis of treatment outcome of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Lithuania, a small Eastern European country. Children < 18 years old who were treated for AML from 2000 to 2013 were included (n = 54). Estimates of 5-year event-free (EFS5y) and overall survival (OS5y) rates were analyzed. Comparing periods 2000-2006 (n = 32) and 2007-2013 (n = 22), the EFS5y improved from 31 to 63% (p = 0.04), and the OS5y improved from 31 to 72% (p = 0.02) because of reductions in toxicity-related mortality (42 vs. 15%, p = 0.08) and relapse (43 vs. 25%, p = 0.08). The most significant improvement was demonstrated in high-risk patients (OS5y improved from 26 to 75%, p = 0.02) who benefited from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: the post-transplant EFS5y increased from 13 to 86% (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The current survival rate of Lithuanian children treated for AML was comparable to the expected rate in other parts of Europe. What is Known: * In the last three decades, significant improvement has been achieved in treating childhood cancer, with an overall survival (OS) rate of > 80% in high-income countries. The difference in survival rates between Northern/Western and Eastern European countries as well as between high- and middle-/low-income countries is as much as 20%. Recently, the 5-year event-free survival rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has reached > 60% in high-income countries. The survival rates for myeloproliferative diseases were the lowest in Eastern European countries. * The reported inferior survival rates were calculated based on outcome data of patients treated until 2007. The recent survival rates in Eastern European countries are unknown. What is New: * Being a small Eastern European country, Lithuania has experienced good economic growth during the last decade. We hypothesized that economic growth and gain of experience could result in better survival rates of children treated for cancer in our country in recent years. * A population-based analysis of treatment outcome of childhood AML treated in Lithuania in the recent years was performed for the first time. The survival rates of childhood AML in Lithuania are comparable to those of other high-income countries. Current survival rates of children treated for cancer in Eastern European countries could be comparable to the best current standards contributing to better European survival rates of childhood cancer in general.","['Kairiene, Igne', 'Pasauliene, Ramune', 'Lipunova, Nadezda', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Rageliene, Lina', 'Rascon, Jelena']","['Kairiene I', 'Pasauliene R', 'Lipunova N', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Rageliene L', 'Rascon J']","['Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Cancer Control and Prevention Center, National Cancer Institute, Vilnius, Lithuania.', ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania. jelena.rascon@gmail.com.', ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania. jelena.rascon@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170815,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Lithuania/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Quality Improvement', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood acute myeloid leukemia', 'Eastern Europe', 'Improvement', 'Survival rates']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/06/02 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00431-017-2978-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00431-017-2978-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2017 Oct;176(10):1329-1337. doi: 10.1007/s00431-017-2978-9.

Until now, no reviews have been published from a computational perspective concerning the development of personalized medicine intelligent techniques for leukaemia patients using molecular data analysis. This review studies the published empirical research on personalized medicine in leukaemia and synthesizes findings across studies related to intelligence techniques in leukaemia, with specific attention to particular categories of these studies to help identify opportunities for further research into personalized medicine support systems in chronic myeloid leukaemia. A systematic search was carried out to identify studies using intelligence techniques in leukaemia and to categorize these studies based on leukaemia type and also the task, data source, and purpose of the studies. Most studies used molecular data analysis for personalized medicine, but future advancement for leukaemia patients requires molecular models that use advanced machine-learning methods to automate decision-making in treatment management to deliver supportive medical information to the patient in clinical practice.","['Banjar, Haneen', 'Adelson, David', 'Brown, Fred', 'Chaudhri, Naeem']","['Banjar H', 'Adelson D', 'Brown F', 'Chaudhri N']","['School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Computer Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Oncology Centre, Section of Hematology, HSCT, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170725,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,,IM,"['*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', '*Precision Medicine', 'Research']",,,2017/08/16 06:00,2018/04/27 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/3587309 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2017;2017:3587309. doi: 10.1155/2017/3587309.

Compared to healthy controls, CD56(dim) NK cells in CLL patients displayed reduced expression of the NKG2D activating receptor and increased CD27 expression, which indicates declines in mature cells. In addition, NK cells from CLL patients showed reduced degranulation responses toward transformed B cells alone or with rituximab and were more sensitive to activation-induced cell death. We further noted a striking reduction in the frequency and viability of NK cells expressing the inhibitory killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR)2DL1 and/or KIR3DL1, which progressed over time in most patients. Comparisons between a CLL patient and healthy monozygotic twin were consistent with our results in the larger cohorts. Functional and biomarker alterations were less pronounced on NK cells from SLL patients, which have lower tumor burden in peripheral blood than CLL, but significant reduction in degranulation under ADCC conditions and lower frequency and viability of KIR-expressing NK cells were still evident in SLL. We conclude that mature KIR-expressing NK cells respond to the high circulating B cell tumor burden in CLL, but undergo activation-induced apoptosis.

The identification of those abnormalities is clinically important because they are considered significant risk-stratifying markers. AIMS: There are insufficient data of cytogenetic profiles in Saudi Arabian patients with childhood ALL leukemia. We have examined a cohort of 110 cases of ALL to determine the cytogenetic profiles and prevalence of FLT3 mutations and analysis of the more frequently observed abnormalities and its correlations to other biologic factors and patient outcomes and to compare our results with previously published results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients-We reviewed all cases from 2007 to 2016 with an established diagnosis of childhood ALL. Of the 110 patients, 98 were B-lineage ALL and 12 T-cell ALL. All the patients were treated by UKALL 2003 protocol and risk stratified according previously published criteria. Cytogenetic analysis-Chromosome banding analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to detect genetic aberrations. Analysis of FLT3 mutations-Bone marrow or blood samples were screened for FLT3 mutations (internal tandem duplications, and point mutations, D835) using polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULT: Cytogenetic analysis showed chromosomal anomalies in 68 out of 102 cases with an overall incidence 66.7%. The most frequent chromosomal anomalies in ALL were hyperdiploidy, t(9;22), t(12;21), and MLL gene rearrangements. Our data are in accordance with those published previously and showed that FLT3 mutations are not common in patients with ALL (4.7%) and have no prognostic relevance in pediatric patients with ALL. On the contrary, t(9;22), MLL gene rearrangements and hypodiploidy were signs of a bad prognosis in childhood ALL with high rate of relapse and shorter overall survival compared with the standard-risk group (P = .031).The event-free survival was also found to be worse (P = .040). CONCLUSIONS: Our data are in accordance with those published previously, confirming the overall frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities and their prognostic relevance.","['Alkhayat, Nawaf', 'Elborai, Yasser', 'Al Sharif, Omer', 'Al Shahrani, Mohammad', 'Alsuhaibani, Omar', 'Awad, Mohammed', 'Elghezal, Hatem', 'Ben-Abdallah Bouhajar, Inesse', 'Alfaraj, Mona', 'Al Mussaed, Eman', 'Alabbas, Fahad', 'Elyamany, Ghaleb']","['Alkhayat N', 'Elborai Y', 'Al Sharif O', 'Al Shahrani M', 'Alsuhaibani O', 'Awad M', 'Elghezal H', 'Ben-Abdallah Bouhajar I', 'Alfaraj M', 'Al Mussaed E', 'Alabbas F', 'Elyamany G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170724,United States,Clin Med Insights Oncol,Clinical Medicine Insights.

Indices (0-1) of the roles of ageing (ARD), genetics (GRD) and exogenous (ERD) variables in deaths due to disease were established, and the sum of ARD, GRD and ERD was 1 (value of each indices was <1). Results showed that ageing plays an important role in death from chronic disease; exogenous factors may contribute more to the pattern of chronic disease than genetic factors (ARD, GRC and ERD were 0.818, 0.058 and 0.124 respectively for all non-communicable diseases). In descending order, ERD for non-communicable diseases were breast cancer, leukaemia, cancer of the cervix uteri and uterus, liver cancer, nephritis and nephropathy, stomach cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, COPD, and Alzheimer's disease, while a smaller ERD indicated a tendency of natural death. An understanding of the aforementioned complex relationships of specific non-communicable diseases will be beneficial in designing primary prevention measures for non-communicable diseases in China.","['Hui, Liu']",['Hui L'],"['Department of Clinical Immunology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, China. liuhui60@sina.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170815,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical', 'Mortality', 'Noncommunicable Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prevalence', 'ROC Curve', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/08/16 06:00,2019/03/16 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-08539-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-08539-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Aug 15;7(1):8159. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-08539-0.,,,,PMC5557977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified 70 publications reporting 45 SNPs in 36 genes significantly associated with disease-related mortality, progression-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and/or overall survival after BMT. Replication and validation of these SNP associations were performed using DISCOVeRY-BMT (Determining the Influence of Susceptibility COnveying Variants Related to one-Year mortality after BMT), a well-powered genome-wide association study consisting of 2 cohorts, totaling 2888 BMT recipients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, and their HLA-matched unrelated donors, reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Gene-based tests were used to assess the aggregate effect of SNPs on outcome. None of the previously reported significant SNPs replicated at P < .05 in DISCOVeRY-BMT. Validation analyses showed association with one previously reported donor SNP at P < .05 and survival; more associations would be anticipated by chance alone. No gene-based tests were significant at P < .05. Functional annotation with publicly available data shows these candidate SNPs most likely do not have biochemical function; only 13% of candidate SNPs correlate with gene expression or are predicted to impact transcription factor binding. Of these, half do not impact the candidate gene of interest; the other half correlate with expression of multiple genes. These findings emphasize the peril of pursing candidate approaches and the importance of adequately powered tests of unbiased genome-wide associations with BMT clinical outcomes given the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes.","['Karaesmen, Ezgi', 'Rizvi, Abbas A', 'Preus, Leah M', 'McCarthy, Philip L', 'Pasquini, Marcelo C', 'Onel, Kenan', 'Zhu, Xiaochun', 'Spellman, Stephen', 'Haiman, Christopher A', 'Stram, Daniel O', 'Pooler, Loreall', 'Sheng, Xin', 'Zhu, Qianqian', 'Yan, Li', 'Liu, Qian', 'Hu, Qiang', 'Webb, Amy', 'Brock, Guy', 'Clay-Gilmour, Alyssa I', 'Battaglia, Sebastiano', 'Tritchler, David', 'Liu, Song', 'Hahn, Theresa', 'Sucheston-Campbell, Lara E']","['Karaesmen E', 'Rizvi AA', 'Preus LM', 'McCarthy PL', 'Pasquini MC', 'Onel K', 'Zhu X', 'Spellman S', 'Haiman CA', 'Stram DO', 'Pooler L', 'Sheng X', 'Zhu Q', 'Yan L', 'Liu Q', 'Hu Q', 'Webb A', 'Brock G', 'Clay-Gilmour AI', 'Battaglia S', 'Tritchler D', 'Liu S', 'Hahn T', 'Sucheston-Campbell LE']","['College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Division of Epidemiology, The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Center for Immunotherapy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Biostatistics, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY; and.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170815,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', '*Disease-Free Survival', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/mortality/therapy', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', '*Validation Studies as Topic']",,,2017/08/16 06:00,2017/10/24 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32835-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-05-784637 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Sep 28;130(13):1585-1596. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-784637.

Using rat Langendorff heart model and human acute myeloid leukaemia 60 (HL60) cell line we detected the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha during Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity and the effect of Sunitinib on cancer progression. The cardioprotective and anti-cancer properties of the A3 adenosine receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (IB-MECA) were investigated. The cardiac effect of Sunitinib (1microM) and IB-MECA (1nM) treatment was measured through haemodynamic and infarct size assessment. The cytotoxic effect of Sunitinib (0.1 - 10muM) and IB-MECA (10nM - 10muM) on HL60 cells was assessed using the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay technique. Myocardial injury associated microRNAs (miR-1, miR-27a, miR-133a and miR-133b) and cancer associated microRNAs (miR-15a, miR-16-1 and miR-155) were profiled by qRT-PCR in the cardiac tissue and HL60 cells, while phosphorylated PKCalpha levels were measured by Western Blot analysis. Sunitinib treatment increased infarct size and decreased left ventricular developed pressure and heart rate. Co-treatment of IB-MECA reversed the myocardial injury produced by Sunitinib administration. IB-MECA did not jeopardize the anti-cancer effect of Sunitinib in HL60 cells. The expression signature of the specific microRNAs in cardiac tissue and HL60 cells showed an altered expression profile when treated with Sunitinib and IB-MECA. pPKCalpha levels were increased by Sunitinib treatment in cardiac tissue and HL60 cells and co-administration of IB-MECA attenuated this increase in the cardiac tissue. This study reveals that A3 adenosine receptor activation by IB-MECA attenuates Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity through the involvement of PKCalpha.","['Sandhu, Hardip', 'Cooper, Samantha', 'Hussain, Afthab', 'Mee, Christopher', 'Maddock, Helen']","['Sandhu H', 'Cooper S', 'Hussain A', 'Mee C', 'Maddock H']","['Faculty Research Centre in Applied Biological and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University, United Kingdom.

A peanut agglutinin-beta-cyclodextrin (PNA-beta-CD) functionalized poly(hydroxyethyl methylacrylate-ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) monolith was designed via a click reaction. Thanking to the specificity of PNA-beta-CD for the targets, the material exhibited enhanced enrichment selectivity and extraction efficiency for IgG galactosylation glycopeptides. Under optimal conditions, the developed method gave a linear range of 0.005-5 pmol for IgG glycopeptides with the regression coefficient greater than 0.9990, and the detection limit of IgG galactosylation glycopeptides as low as 0.5 fmol was achieved. The PMME-MS method was applied to IgG galactosylation glycopeptides in real samples including human serum and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lysate. A series of unique IgG galactosylation glycopeptides were captured by the monolith in the complex samples, indicating satisfactory enrichment ability for IgG galactosylation glycopeptides. The quick and integrated online PMME-MS method exhibited high selectivity for IgG galactosylation, demonstrating its perspectives on the development and broad applications of MS in studying galactosylation proteins regulated biological processes.","['Zheng, Haijiao', 'Zhu, Tenggao', 'Li, Xiqian', 'Ma, Jiutong', 'Jia, Qiong']","['Zheng H', 'Zhu T', 'Li X', 'Ma J', 'Jia Q']","['College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China.', 'China-Japan Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China.', 'College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China.

However, treatment of CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics features remains a challenge and the outcome of these hard-to-treat patients is dismal. At the 2017 ASCO Meeting, results of the GENUINE phase III trial showed that, by adding ublituximab, a glycoengineered, anti-CD20 type 1 monoclonal antibody, to ibrutinib, the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity may be improved in high-risk CLL patients. A further way to improve the results obtained with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is the parallel use of ibrutinib with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Through this investigational approach, the rate of MRD negativity was shown to be higher, implying potential eradication of CLL. These novel data indicate that ibrutinib continues to have a positive effect in CLL.","['Molica, Stefano']",['Molica S'],"['Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Viale Pio X, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Conference', 'Journal Article']",20170816,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'U59UGK3IPC (ublituximab)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ASCO 2017', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Ibrutinib', '*Novel association']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/02/01 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12916-017-0920-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12916-017-0920-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2017 Aug 16;15(1):156. doi: 10.1186/s12916-017-0920-7.,,,,PMC5558721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of CLL-1 in 123 patients with de novo CD34(+) Non-M3 AML. Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of CLL-1 on immature compartment in AML and control groups. We found that CLL-1 expression level on blast compartment was closely linked to clinical characteristics, treatment response, and survival outcome of patients. Decreased expression of CLL-1 was observed on immature compartment from AML patients as compared with controls (62.6% vs. 86.5%, P < 0.05). Logistic model exhibited that CLL-1(low) independently predicted low complete remission rate with an odds ratio of 4.57 (2.53-6.61, P < 0.05). Additionally, CLL-1 expression level at diagnosis was inversely correlated to the residual blast cells (residual leukemia cell) after induction chemotherapy (r = -0.423, P < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that CLL-1(low) was still an independent adverse predictor (P < 0.05 for event-free survival, P < 0.05 for overall survival). Notably, CLL-1(low) was able to discriminate poor survival patients from intermediate- and favorable-risk groups. Taken together, CLL-1 is a novel prognostic predictor that could be exploited to supplement the current AML prognostic risk stratification system, and potentially optimize the clinical management of AML.","['Wang, Yan-Yu', 'Chen, Wen-Lian', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Sheng, Yan', 'Wu, Jing', 'Hao, Jie', 'Liu, Zhan-Yun', 'Zhu, Yong-Mei', 'Chen, Bing', 'Xiong, Shu-Min', 'Chen, Yu', 'Chen, Qiu-Sheng', 'Sun, Hui-Ping', 'Li, Jun-Min', 'Wang, Jin']","['Wang YY', 'Chen WL', 'Weng XQ', 'Sheng Y', 'Wu J', 'Hao J', 'Liu ZY', 'Zhu YM', 'Chen B', 'Xiong SM', 'Chen Y', 'Chen QS', 'Sun HP', 'Li JM', 'Wang J']","['1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '2 Department of Hematology, Bei Zhan Hospital , Shanghai, China .', '3 Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Xu Hui District , Shanghai, China .', '4 University of Hawaii Cancer Center , Honolulu, Hawaii.', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '2 Department of Hematology, Bei Zhan Hospital , Shanghai, China .', '2 Department of Hematology, Bei Zhan Hospital , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170921,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lectins, C-Type/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*a novel adverse predictor', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*low CLL-1 expression']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/05/29 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1089/scd.2016.0310 [pii]', '10.1089/scd.2016.0310 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2017 Oct 15;26(20):1460-1467. doi: 10.1089/scd.2016.0310.

However, good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant manufacturing of clinical-grade NK cells at sufficiently high numbers represents a great challenge. Therefore, previous expansion protocols for those effector cells were improved and optimized by using newly developed culture medium, interleukin (IL)-21, and autologous feeder cells (FCs). Separation of primary human NK cells (CD56(+)CD3(-)) was carried out with the CliniMACS Prodigy((R)) in a single process, starting with approximately 1.2 x 10(9) leukocytes collected by small-scale lymphapheresis or from buffy coats. Enriched NK cells were adjusted to starting cell concentrations within approximately 1 x 10(6) effector cells/mL and cultured in comparative expansion experiments for 14 days with IL-2 (1,000 IU/mL) in different GMP-compliant media (X-VIVO()10, CellGro((R)), TexMACS(), and NK MACS((R))). After medium optimization, beneficial effects for functionality and phenotype were investigated at the beginning of cell expansion with irradiated (25 Gy) autologous FCs at a ratio of 20:1 (feeder: NK) in the presence or absence of IL-21 (100 ng/mL). Additionally, expanded NK cells were gene modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) against CD123, a common marker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine release of transduced NK cells were determined against KG1a cells in flow cytometric analysis and fluorescent imaging. The Prodigy manufacturing process revealed high target cell viabilities (median 95.4%), adequate NK cell recovery (median 60.4%), and purity of 95.4% in regard to CD56(+)CD3(-) target cells. The process in its early phase of development led to a median T-cell depletion of log 3.5 after CD3 depletion and log 3.6 after the whole process, including CD3 depletion and CD56 enrichment steps. Manually performed experiments to test different culture media demonstrated significantly higher NK cell expansion rates and an approximately equal distribution of CD56(dim)CD16(pos) and CD56(bright)CD16(dim&neg) NK subsets on day 14 with cells cultivated in NK MACS((R)) media. Moreover, effector cell expansion in manually performed experiments with NK MACS((R)) containing IL-2 and irradiated autologous FCs and IL-21, both added at the initiation of the culture, induced an 85-fold NK cell expansion. Compared to freshly isolated NK cells, expanded NK cells expressed significantly higher levels of NKp30, NKp44, NKG2D, TRAIL, FasL, CD69, and CD137, and showed comparable cell viabilities and killing/degranulation activities against tumor and leukemic cell lines in vitro. NK cells used for CAR transduction showed the highest anti-CD123 CAR expression on day 3 after gene modification. These anti-CD123 CAR-engineered NK cells demonstrated improved cytotoxicity against the CD123(pos) AML cell line KG1a and primary AML blasts. In addition, CAR NK cells showed higher degranulation and enhanced secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and granzyme A and B. In fluorescence imaging, specific interactions that initiated apoptotic processes in the AML target cells were detected between CAR NK cells and KG1a. After the fully automated NK cell separation process on Prodigy, a new NK cell expansion protocol was generated that resulted in high numbers of NK cells with potent antitumor activity, which could be modified efficiently by novel third-generation, alpha-retroviral SIN vector constructs. Next steps are the integration of the manual expansion procedure in the fully integrated platform for a standardized GMP-compliant overall process in this closed system that also may include gene modification of NK cells to optimize target-specific antitumor activity.","['Kloss, Stephan', 'Oberschmidt, Olaf', 'Morgan, Michael', 'Dahlke, Julia', 'Arseniev, Lubomir', 'Huppert, Volker', 'Granzin, Markus', 'Gardlowski, Tanja', 'Matthies, Nadine', 'Soltenborn, Stephanie', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Koehl, Ulrike']","['Kloss S', 'Oberschmidt O', 'Morgan M', 'Dahlke J', 'Arseniev L', 'Huppert V', 'Granzin M', 'Gardlowski T', 'Matthies N', 'Soltenborn S', 'Schambach A', 'Koehl U']","['1 Institute for Cellular Therapeutics, GMPDU, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '1 Institute for Cellular Therapeutics, GMPDU, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '2 Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '3 REBIRTH Cluster of Excellence, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '2 Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '3 REBIRTH Cluster of Excellence, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '1 Institute for Cellular Therapeutics, GMPDU, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '4 Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach , Germany.', '4 Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach , Germany.', '1 Institute for Cellular Therapeutics, GMPDU, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '1 Institute for Cellular Therapeutics, GMPDU, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '4 Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach , Germany.', '2 Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', '3 REBIRTH Cluster of Excellence, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', ""5 Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School , Boston, Massachusetts."", '1 Institute for Cellular Therapeutics, GMPDU, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170815,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Automation, Laboratory', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Feeder Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-21', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*autologous feeder cells', '*chimeric antigen receptor-modified NK cells', '*closed GMP-compliant Prodigy system', '*interleukin-3 receptor subunit alpha (CD123)']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/07/31 06:00,['2017/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2017.157 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2017 Oct;28(10):897-913. doi: 10.1089/hum.2017.157.

Immunotherapy is a growing area of cancer research, which has been applied for the treatment of numerous types of cancer, including leukemia. The present study generated AML cell-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro and investigated the effect of combining CTL treatment with one of the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of hematological malignancies, cytarabine, on AML cell apoptosis. Firstly, it was observed that monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors could be used to generate large numbers of CD3(+)CD8(+) CTLs through immune stimulation. These CD3(+)CD8(+) CTLs could effectively recognize and induce the apoptosis of human Kasumi-3 AML cells. In addition, cytarabine-induced AML cell apoptosis was enhanced by CTL treatment. Western blotting revealed that Bcl-2 expression was downregulated in AML cells following cytarabine and CTL treatment, indicating that the synergistic effect of this treatment on AML cell apoptosis is due to the downregulation of Bcl-2. These results highlight the potential application of CTL immunotherapy for the treatment of AML. Further studies optimizing the specificity and potency of CTLs, and identifying favorable combinations with other chemotherapeutic drug are required.","['Deng, Rui', 'Fan, Fang-Yi', 'Yi, Hai', 'Fu, Li', 'Zeng, Yan', 'Wang, Yi', 'Miao, Xiao-Juan', 'Shuai, Yan-Rong', 'He, Guang-Cui', 'Su, Yi']","['Deng R', 'Fan FY', 'Yi H', 'Fu L', 'Zeng Y', 'Wang Y', 'Miao XJ', 'Shuai YR', 'He GC', 'Su Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Chengdu Military General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Chengdu, Sichuan 610083, P.R.

This study is aimed to investigate the anti-leukemia activity of physcion in ALL. Our results have showed that physcion could significantly suppress cell growth, induce apoptosis and blocked cell cycle progression in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that physcion downregulated the expression of HOXA5, which is responsible for the anti-leukemia activity of physcion. To verify this finding, siRNA targeting HOXA5 and overexpressing plasmid were used to repress HOXA5 expression and introduce ectopic overexpression of HOXA5 in ALL cell lines, respectively. Our results showed that overexpression of HOXA5 significantly abrogated the inducing effect of physcion on apoptosis and cell cycle blockasde. In contrast, knockdown of HOXA5 by siRNA enhanced the anti-tumor effect of physcion on ALL cell lines. Our results provided experimental base for the use of physcion in the treatment of ALL.","['Gao, Fei', 'Liu, Wenjun', 'Guo, Qulian', 'Bai, Yongqi', 'Yang, Hong', 'Chen, Hongying']","['Gao F', 'Liu W', 'Guo Q', 'Bai Y', 'Yang H', 'Chen H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Affliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou 646000, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou 646000, Sichuan, China.

Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR method was used to detect the expression levels of TRIP13 mRNA of CD19(+) B lymphocytes in 30 cases of patients with CLL and 12 cases of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell donors (normal control group) . Lentivirus mediated shRNA was used to interference the mRNA and TRIP13 protein in CLL cells JVM-2. Scramble sequence was used as control. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium colorimetric assay (MTT) and flow cytometry was used to detect the cell proliferation and apoptosis in TRIP13 knocked-down and negative control JVM-2 cells. Results: TRIP13 mRNA level was significantly higher in 30 cases of CLL patients (2(- big up tri, openCt)= 0.014 89) compared with 12 healthy donors (2(- big up tri, openCt)= 0.000 19) (P<0.001) . Validated TRIP13 shRNA target was achieved in JVM2 cell.

Sample preparation, which involved only 5 times dilution with addition of Triton X-100, Antifoam B, and l-cysteine, suppressed excessive foaming in a hydride generator. Calibration slopes for whole blood and blood plasma spiked with arsenate, monomethylarsonate, and dimethylarsinate at 0.25-1 mug L(-1) As and 0.025-0.1 mug L(-1) As for AAS and ICPMS detection, respectively, did not differ from slopes in aqueous solutions. HG-CT-AAS was used to analyze samples with elevated levels of arsenic species-blood plasma from patients treated with arsenic trioxide for acute promyelocytic leukemia and whole blood from mice fed an arsenic-containing diet. A good agreement between results of the direct analysis and analysis after mild digestion in phosphoric acid proved the good efficiency of the direct HG-CT procedure for the arsenic species in these types of biological samples. In the next step, plasma and whole blood from healthy donors that were spiked with the plasma from leukemia patients at levels of 0.15-0.4 mug L(-1) As were analyzed by direct HG-CT-ICPMS. Good recoveries for all species even at these low levels (88-104%) were obtained. Limits of detection in blood and plasma were 0.014 mug L(-1) for inorganic arsenic and below 0.002 mug L(-1) As for methylated arsenic species. Thus, the ultrasensitive direct HG-CT-ICPMS method is uniquely suited for analyses of blood plasma and whole blood from individuals at low exposure levels.","['Matousek, Tomas', 'Wang, Zhifeng', 'Douillet, Christelle', 'Musil, Stanislav', 'Styblo, Miroslav']","['Matousek T', 'Wang Z', 'Douillet C', 'Musil S', 'Styblo M']","['Institute of Analytical Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i. , Veveri 97, Brno 602 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , 2302 MHRC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7461, United States.', 'School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shandong University , 27 Shanda South Road, Jinan, Shandong 250100, China.', 'Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , 2302 MHRC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7461, United States.', 'Institute of Analytical Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i. , Veveri 97, Brno 602 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , 2302 MHRC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7461, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170828,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,['N712M78A8G (Arsenic)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Mice']",,,2017/08/16 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01868 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2017 Sep 19;89(18):9633-9637. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01868.

28809522,,Publisher,,,,,,2012,Vemurafenib Therapy and BRAF and NRAS Genotype,,,"Vemurafenib is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E variant. BRAF is an intracellular kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. BRAF is involved in regulating important cell functions such as cell growth, division, differentiation, and apoptosis. BRAF is also a proto-oncogene-when mutated it has the ability to transform normal cells into cancerous cells. Variation in the kinase domain of BRAF have been associated with various cancers. The most common BRAF variant, V600E, constitutively activates the kinase, and causes cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that would normally be required. The V600E variant is detected in approximately 50% of melanomas (1, 2). The FDA-approved drug label for vemurafenib states that the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens should be confirmed, using an FDA-approved test, before starting treatment with vemurafenib. The label also states that vemurafenib is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma (3). Variations in NRAS, also an oncogene, are found in up to 30% of all malignancies and in approximately 15-20% of melanomas. NRAS variants activate MAPK and have been implicated in in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Vemurafenib's label warns that one adverse effect associated with therapy may be the progression of pre-existing chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with NRAS mutation (3). Other adverse effects include arthralgia, rash, alopecia, photosensitivity reaction, pruritus, and skin papilloma.","['Dean, Laura']",['Dean L'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,,,2017/08/16 06:01,2017/08/16 06:01,,,['NBK447416 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,20170816,['20170815'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Medical Genetics Summaries'],['2017/08/16 06:01'],,,,,,,,,"['Pratt, Victoria M.', 'Scott, Stuart A.', 'Pirmohamed, Munir', 'Esquivel, Bernard', 'Kane, Megan S.', 'Kattman, Brandi L.', 'Malheiro, Adriana J.']","['Pratt VM', 'Scott SA', 'Pirmohamed M', 'Esquivel B', 'Kane MS', 'Kattman BL', 'Malheiro AJ']",,,,,

Attention has been focussed on developing new drug carriers with high adsorption capacity and rapid adsorption rate in order to minimize the side effects of DOX. Graphene oxide (GO), a new type of nanomaterial in the carbon family, was prepared by Hummers method and used as adsorbent for DOX from aqueous solution. The physico-chemical properties of GO were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), zeta potential, and element analysis. The adsorption properties of DOX on GO were studied as a function of contact time, adsorbent dosage, temperature and pH value. The results showed that GO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 1428.57 mg/g and the adsorption isotherm data fitted the Langmuir model. The kinetics of adsorption fits a pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamic studies indicate that the adsorption of DOX on GO is spontaneous and endothermic in nature.","['Wu, Shaoling', 'Zhao, Xindong', 'Li, Yanhui', 'Du, Qiuju', 'Sun, Jiankun', 'Wang, Yonghao', 'Wang, Xin', 'Xia, Yanzhi', 'Wang, Zonghua', 'Xia, Linhua']","['Wu S', 'Zhao X', 'Li Y', 'Du Q', 'Sun J', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X', 'Xia Y', 'Wang Z', 'Xia L']","['Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China. qdwushaoling@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. qdwushaoling@163.com.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. qdwushaoling@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. zhaoxindong@yahoo.com.cn.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. zhaoxindong@yahoo.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. liyanhui@tsinghua.org.cn.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. liyanhui@tsinghua.org.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. duqiuju999@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. duqiuju999@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. kun3812@163.com.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. kun3812@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. wangyonghao1988@sina.com.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. wangyonghao1988@sina.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China. xinwang55@yahoo.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. qdxyzh@163.com.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. qdxyzh@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. wang_zonghua@yahoo.com.cn.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. wang_zonghua@yahoo.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of medical College, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. autumnred@hotmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, The Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China. autumnred@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130515,Switzerland,Materials (Basel),"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",101555929,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['adsorption', 'doxorubicin hydrochloride', 'graphene oxide', 'isotherm', 'kinetic']",2013/05/15 00:00,2013/05/15 00:01,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 00:01 [medline]']","['ma6052026 [pii]', '10.3390/ma6052026 [doi]']",epublish,Materials (Basel). 2013 May 15;6(5):2026-2042. doi: 10.3390/ma6052026.,,,,PMC5452512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase which reduces methyltetrahydrofolate, a key component in one carbon metabolism, thus reducing cell proliferation. Further perturbations to one carbon metabolism, such as reduced vitamin B12 levels via the use of nitrous oxide for sedation during childhood ALL treatment, may increase neurotoxicity risk. With B12 as an enzymatic cofactor, methyltetrahydrofolate is essential to produce methionine, which is critical for DNA methylation. We investigated global and gene specific DNA methylation in neuronal cell lines in response to MTX treatment and vitamin B12 concentration individually, and in combination. RESULTS: MTX treatment alone significantly increased LINE-1 methylation in SH-SY5Y (p = 0.040) and DAOY (p < 0.001), and increased FKBP5 methylation in MO3.13 cells (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: We conclude that altered DNA methylation of brain/central nervous system cells could be one mechanism involved in MTX treatment-related neurotoxicities and neurocognitive late effects in ALL survivors.","['Forster, Victoria J', 'McDonnell, Alex', 'Theobald, Rachel', 'McKay, Jill A']","['Forster VJ', 'McDonnell A', 'Theobald R', 'McKay JA']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Institute of Health & Society, Human Nutrition Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Institute of Health & Society, Human Nutrition Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Institute of Health & Society, Human Nutrition Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170815,England,Epigenomics,Epigenomics,101519720,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (tacrolimus binding protein 5)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Neurons/*drug effects', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*epigenetic', '*late effects', '*methotrexate', '*neurocognition', '*neurotoxicity', '*one carbon metabolism', '*vitamin B12']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/epi-2016-0165 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenomics. 2017 Sep;9(9):1205-1218. doi: 10.2217/epi-2016-0165.

Thus, in the present study, the underlying apoptotic mechanism of Astragalin isolated from Aceriphyllum rossii was elucidated in A375P and SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells. Astragalin exerted cytotoxicity in A375P and SK-MEL-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, Astragalin significantly increased the number of TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive cells and sub-G1 population as a feature of apoptosis in A375P and SK-MEL-2 cells compared with untreated control. Consistently, western blotting revealed that Astragalin activated caspase 9/3 and Bax, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and attenuated the expression of cyclin D1, Mcl-1, and Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10 (SOX10) in A375P and SK-MEL-2 cells. Of note, ectopic expression of SOX10 reduced the apoptotic ability of Astragalin to inhibit proliferation, cleave poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caspase 3 in A375P and SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells. Overall, our findings provide evidence that Astragalin induces apoptosis in A375P and SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells via activation of caspase9/3 and inhibition of SOX10 signaling.

A new tablet formulation of posaconazole with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared to posaconazole oral solution has recently been approved. The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the newly developed posaconazole tablets versus FLU oral suspension or ITRA oral solution for preventing IFDs in high-risk neutropenic patients with AML or MDS and from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS). METHODS: A previously validated economic model was used. The probabilities of experiencing an IFD, an IFD-related death or death from other causes over 100 days were based on clinical trial data and input into a decision tree. Surviving patients were entered into a Markov model to calculate total costs, number of IFDs and number of life-years gained per patient over a lifetime horizon in each disease and treatment group. Two health states, alive and dead, were considered. Health effects were discounted using a rate of 3%. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: During the first 100 days, posaconazole tablets were associated with a lower risk of IFDs (0.046 vs. 0.111), longer life expectancy (2.92 vs. 2.69 years) and lower total costs (euro5906.06 vs. euro7847.20 per patient) over the patients' lifetimes compared to FLU or ITRA treatments. Thus, posaconazole tablets were more effective and less costly than FLU or ITRA. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that there was a 79.9% probability of posaconazole tablets being cost-saving compared to FLU or ITRA. CONCLUSION: From the Spanish NHS perspective, posaconazole tablets are cost-effective compared to FLU or ITRA in AML or MSD patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and at high risk for IFDs.

Based on these studies, thrombotic events in MF are about as common as in essential thrombocytemia (ET) but less common than in polycythemia vera (PV), while bleeding events are relatively more common in MF than in ET or PV. The emergence of the concept of prefibrotic primary MF (PMF), which is associated with a higher frequency of thrombohemorrhagic complications than ET, and the growing evidence that prefibrotic PMF may also have a different thrombotic and bleeding risk profiles than fibrotic (overt) PMF have emphasized the need for a reappraisal of the risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage in patients with MF.

Few studies have examined employment issues among AML survivors and to our knowledge, no study has examined the long-term effects of treatment on return to work. This study is the first to utilize a validated measure of work-related limitation and productivity (WLQ-16) to assess the long-term effects of AML treatment on employment rates, work-related limitations, and overall productivity. We examined RTW issues in 111 adult AML 1-year survivors after conventional IC. We found that, over time, the number of employed survivors increased (to 54% by 36 months) while the number of unemployed, retired, and sick leave patients decreased. Among those employed, the majority were employed full time. Employed individuals reported few work-related limitations and productivity loss scores were low, ranging from 3.47% at 18 months to 2.34% at 36 months. These data suggest that, over time, over half of AML survivors who underwent IC regain social, emotional, cognitive, and physical function sufficient to RTW with few limitations.","['Samadi, Osai', 'Breunis, Henriette', 'Sandoval, Joanna', 'Akilan, Kosalan', 'Timilshina, Narhari', 'Alibhai, Shabbir M H']","['Samadi O', 'Breunis H', 'Sandoval J', 'Akilan K', 'Timilshina N', 'Alibhai SMH']","['Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Room EN14-214, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Room EN14-214, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Room EN14-214, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Room EN14-214, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Room EN14-214, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Room EN14-214, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada. shabbir.alibhai@uhn.ca.', 'Department of Medicine and Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. shabbir.alibhai@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170814,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', '*Return to Work']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Return to work', 'WLQ-16', 'Work-related disability']",2017/08/16 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2017/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3097-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3097-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Oct;96(10):1625-1633. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3097-4.

In the present study, a total of 108 peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at diagnosis (n=31), and at 3 and 6 months following treatment with TKI [imatinib (n=12), dasatinib (n=11) and nilotinib groups (n=8)] and healthy controls (n=15). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from the patients prior to and following TKI treatment. The subtype and number of T lymphocytes in patients and healthy donors were analyzed using flow cytometry. Additionally, flow cytometry and ELISA were used to detect the proliferation and suppression of Tregs. Expression of cytokines and other molecules [forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)] were also analyzed at 3 and 6 months following treatment with TKIs. It was indicated that, at diagnosis, a similar number of lymphocytes were detected in patients and control. However, following treatment with a TKI, the number of total T cells, Tregs, CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells decreased to various degrees in patients. Furthermore, the decrease in the number of Tregs was more significant with time. Although treatment with imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib demonstrated similar inhibitory effects on the quantity of Tregs in vivo, the TKIs exhibited differential effects on the function of Tregs in vitro. Proliferation, suppression and expression of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta] and molecules (FOXP3, GITR and CTLA-4) decreased significantly in treatment groups with imatinib and dasatinib. The decrease was not significant in the nilotinib treatment group. Imatinib and dasatinib may exert more marked inhibitory roles compared with nilotinib on regulating the number and function of Tregs. These results suggest that personalized treatment and follow-up of CML patients during TKI treatment, particularly for those who received post-transplant TKI treatment may be beneficial.","['Lu, Ziyuan', 'Xu, Na', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Gao, Guanlun', 'Li, Lin', 'Huang, Jixian', 'Li, Yuling', 'Lu, Qisi', 'He, Bolin', 'Pan, Chengyun', 'Liu, Xiaoli']","['Lu Z', 'Xu N', 'Zhou X', 'Gao G', 'Li L', 'Huang J', 'Li Y', 'Lu Q', 'He B', 'Pan C', 'Liu X']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.R.

Its major biological activity appears due to the presence of flavonoid group of compounds in its bark extract. OBJECTIVE: In this study, our research aims to analyze the chemopreventive effect of flavonoids, especially a natural phenol catechin present in the bark methanolic extract of SA on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The total bark extract was partitioned and analyzed on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate. The yellow-brown material of spot 4 was analyzed and identified as catechin. The yellowish brown material (YBM) was tested for their chemopreventive potential. An in vivo AML mice model was used to test the efficacy. Hematological parameters (Hb %, red blood cell, and white blood cell count), expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, and DNA fragmentation analysis were performed. RESULTS: After treatment of benzene-exposed mice with the major flavonoid compound, namely catechin, the above parameters increase significantly (P < 0.05). There was an upregulation of p53 and p21, caspase 11 myeloperoxidase, bcl2, and CYP2EI in catechin-treated group. DNA was less fragmented in flavonoid-treated group compared to that of control (P </= 0.05). The present study indicates that the secondary metabolites of SA methanolic bark extract, comprising flavonoid catechin as major constituents, have modulatory effect in cell cycle deregulation and hematological abnormalities induced by benzene in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that catechin from methanolic bark extract of SA effectively attenuates benzene-induced secondary AML in bone marrow, which is likely associated with the anticell cycle deregulation properties of this flavan-3-ol. This study was supported by the observation that catechin (YBM), like doxorubicin, can act as the neutralizer and protector of mortality in cancer cases. SUMMARY: The catechin from methanolic bark extract of Saraca asoca has chemoprotective activity in benzene-induced secondary acute myeloid leukemia.(AML) in bone marrowHematological parameters, structural analysis of DNA showed that the purified catechin attenuates the conditions responsible for the development of AMLThe purified flavonol, catechin has a modulatory effect on different cell cycle deregulations induced by benzene in AML model.","['Mukhopadhyay, Manas Kumar', 'Shaw, Mithun', 'Nath, Debjani']","['Mukhopadhyay MK', 'Shaw M', 'Nath D']","['Department of Zoology, Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Kalyani, Nadia, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Kalyani, Nadia, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology Laboratory, University of Kalyani, Nadia, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170711,India,Pharmacogn Mag,Pharmacognosy magazine,101300403,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Catechin', 'cell cycle regulators', 'chemoprevention', 'doxorubicin', 'flavonoid', 'secondary acute myeloid leukemia']",2017/08/16 06:00,2017/08/16 06:01,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2015/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/pm.pm_326_15 [doi]', 'PM-13-216 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogn Mag. 2017 Jul;13(Suppl 2):S216-S223. doi: 10.4103/pm.pm_326_15.

Here, using metabolomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic approaches, we show that inhibition of the replication stress sensing kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) reduces the output of both de novo and salvage pathways by regulating the activity of their respective rate-limiting enzymes, ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), via distinct molecular mechanisms. Quantification of nucleotide biosynthesis in ATR-inhibited acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells reveals substantial remaining de novo and salvage activities, and could not eliminate the disease in vivo. However, targeting these remaining activities with RNR and dCK inhibitors triggers lethal replication stress in vitro and long-term disease-free survival in mice with B-ALL, without detectable toxicity. Thus the functional interplay between alternative nucleotide biosynthetic routes and ATR provides therapeutic opportunities in leukemia and potentially other cancers.Leukemic cells depend on the nucleotide synthesis pathway to proliferate. Here the authors use metabolomics and proteomics to show that inhibition of ATR reduced the activity of these pathways thus providing a valuable therapeutic target in leukemia.","['Le, Thuc M',

However, the clinical successes of arsenic trioxide in treating hematological cancers have not been translated to solid cancers. This is due to arsenic's rapid clearance by the body's immune system before reaching the tumor site. Several attempts have henceforth been made to increase its bioavailability toward solid cancers without increasing its dosage albeit without much success. This review summarizes the past and current utilization of arsenic trioxide in the medical field with primary focus on the implementation of nanotechnology for arsenic trioxide delivery to solid cancer cells. Different approaches that have been employed to increase arsenic's efficacy, specificity and bioavailability to solid cancer cells were evaluated and compared. The potential of combining different approaches or tailoring delivery vehicles to target specific types of solid cancers according to individual cancer characteristics and arsenic chemistry is proposed and discussed.","['Akhtar, Anam', 'Xiaoyan Wang, Scarlet', 'Ghali, Lucy', 'Bell, Celia', 'Wen, Xuesong']","['Akhtar A', 'Xiaoyan Wang S', 'Ghali L', 'Bell C', 'Wen X']","['Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London NW4 4BT, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Biomed Res,Journal of biomedical research,101551157,,,,,,2017/08/16 06:00,2017/08/16 06:01,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7555/JBR.31.20160059 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Res. 2017 Jan 19;31(3):177-188. doi: 10.7555/JBR.31.20160059.,,,,PMC5460606,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These lines include near-haploid human cell lines isolated from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (KBM7 and HAP1), as well as haploid embryonic stem cells derived from several organisms. In all cases, haploidy was shown to be an unstable state, so that cultures of mammalian haploid cells rapidly become enriched in diploids. Here we show that the observed diploidization is due to a proliferative disadvantage of haploid cells compared with diploid cells. Accordingly, single-cell-sorted haploid mammalian cells maintain the haploid state for prolonged periods, owing to the absence of competing diploids. Although the duration of interphase is similar in haploid and diploid cells, haploid cells spend longer in mitosis, indicative of problems in chromosome segregation. In agreement with this, a substantial proportion of the haploids die at or shortly after the last mitosis through activation of a p53-dependent cytotoxic response. Finally, we show that p53 deletion stabilizes haploidy in human HAP1 cells and haploid mouse embryonic stem cells. We propose that, similar to aneuploidy or tetraploidy, haploidy triggers a p53-dependent response that limits the fitness of mammalian cells.","['Olbrich, Teresa', 'Mayor-Ruiz, Cristina', 'Vega-Sendino, Maria', 'Gomez, Carmen', 'Ortega, Sagrario', 'Ruiz, Sergio', 'Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar']","['Olbrich T', 'Mayor-Ruiz C', 'Vega-Sendino M', 'Gomez C', 'Ortega S', 'Ruiz S', 'Fernandez-Capetillo O']","['Genomic Instability Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Genomic Instability Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Genomic Instability Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Transgenics Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Transgenics Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Genomic Instability Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid 28029, Spain; sruizm@cnio.es ofernandez@cnio.es.', 'Genomic Instability Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid 28029, Spain; sruizm@cnio.es ofernandez@cnio.es.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Genome Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute, S-171 21 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170814,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Chromosome Segregation', '*Haploidy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HAP1', '*chromosome segregation', '*embryonic stem cells', '*haploidy', '*p53']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['1705133114 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1705133114 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Aug 29;114(35):9367-9372. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1705133114.

Renal AEs were reported in 73/570 patients (13%) receiving second-line or later bosutinib, and in 22/248 (9%) and 16/251 (6%) receiving first-line bosutinib and imatinib, respectively. eGFR in patients receiving bosutinib declined over time with more patients developing Grade >/= 3b eGFR (< 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease method) with second-line or later bosutinib (139/570, 24%) compared with first-line bosutinib (26/248, 10%) and imatinib (25/251, 10%); time to Grade >/= 3b eGFR was shortest with second-line or later bosutinib. Similar proportions of patients receiving second-line or later bosutinib (74/139, 53%), first-line bosutinib (15/26, 58%), and first-line imatinib (15/25, 60%) improved to >/= 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) eGFR as of the last follow-up. In a regression analysis, first-line treatment with bosutinib versus imatinib was not a significant predictor of Grade >/= 3b eGFR. CONCLUSION: Long-term bosutinib treatment is associated with an apparently reversible decline in renal function with frequency and characteristics similar to renal decline observed with long-term imatinib treatment. Patients with risk factors for Grade >/= 3b eGFR should be monitored closely.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Lipton, Jeff H', 'Lahoti, Amit', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Matczak, Ewa', 'Barry, Elly', 'Leip, Eric', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Khoury, H Jean']","['Cortes JE', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Kim DW', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Lipton JH', 'Lahoti A', 'Talpaz M', 'Matczak E', 'Barry E', 'Leip E', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Khoury HJ']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

However, to our knowledge, this score has never been applied in cases of single umbilical cord blood transplantation (sUCBT). We retrospectively analyzed 207 consecutive patients with acute leukemia who received sUCBT at our center between February 2011 and December 2015. The probabilities of 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of the entire cohort were 65.0% and 59.8%, respectively, whereas the cumulative incidences of 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse rate were 19.5% and 20.3%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, a higher EBMT risk score was associated with worse OS and LFS and higher NRM and relapse rate, ranging from 81.7%, 75.9%, 7.3%, and 15.3%, respectively, for patients with a score of 1 to 43.8%, 44.3%, 31.7%, and 23.9%, respectively, for patients with scores of 4 to 6. Hazard ratios of OS, LFS, and NRM all steadily increased for each additional score point. Importantly, the prognostic value of the EBMT risk score on OS, LFS, NRM, and relapse was maintained in the multivariate analysis. Moreover, considering the univariate analysis results of donor-recipient gender and mismatched allele-level HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 loci on patient outcomes and the fairly strong interaction between time from diagnosis to sUCBT and disease status, we developed a modified sUCBT-EBMT risk score by using degrees of 8-allele HLA match instead of donor type, donor-recipient gender combination, and time from diagnosis to sUCBT, and found that the modified score could also be used as a predictor for patient outcomes after sUCBT. The EBMT risk score is a good predictor of outcomes of patients with leukemia after sUCBT. The modified sUCBT-EBMT risk score can also be used as a pretransplant risk assessment, but this metric still requires further evaluation with a larger cohort.","['Zhu, Xiaoyu', 'Huang, Lulu', 'Zheng, Changcheng', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Geng, Liangquan', 'Tong, Juan', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhang, Xuhan', 'Yao, Wen', 'Song, Kaidi', 'Wang, Xingbing', 'Ding, Kaiyang', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Zhu X', 'Huang L', 'Zheng C', 'Tang B', 'Liu H', 'Geng L', 'Tong J', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang X', 'Yao W', 'Song K', 'Wang X', 'Ding K', 'Sun Z']","['Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.

Our work will lead to the identification of missing key disease genes, which are be highly expressed in a disease-specific gene expression dataset. The experimental evaluation of our method on both the Leukemia and the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gene expression datasets show that DNet performs better than the existing state-of-the-art methods.

The diagnosis is complicated by extended incubation time, diverse clinical manifestations, and mimicking of differential diagnoses. The primary organ affected is the liver, but extrahepatic disease is possible, with vertebral involvement in only a few dozen cases described worldwide. Although vertebral alveolar echinococcosis seems to be rare, it might be under diagnosed, and it might be seen more often as the number of people with immunocompromised conditions increases. Recognition of this syndrome is crucial, because advances in medical and surgical management strategies since the introduction of benzimidazole in 1976 have controlled and relieved symptoms in most cases. In this Grand Round, we present the case of a 75-year-old woman who was referred for biopsy of a lumbar lesion 3 months after she was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The diagnosis of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis with metastasis to the lumbar spine and paravertebral region as well as the brain was confirmed by biopsy, PCR, and serology. The patient was given albendazole and referred for palliative surgery with the aim of pain control. Clinical features of the case are presented and discussed in the context of the literature. This case and review illustrate the complexity of extrahepatic alveolar echinococcosis manifestations and the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach.","['Meinel, Thomas Raphael', 'Gottstein, Bruno', 'Geib, Vanessa', 'Keel, Marius Johann', 'Biral, Ruggero', 'Mohaupt, Markus', 'Brugger, Jan']","['Meinel TR', 'Gottstein B', 'Geib V', 'Keel MJ', 'Biral R', 'Mohaupt M', 'Brugger J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sonnenhofspital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Parasitology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sonnenhofspital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Bern University Hospital, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland; Trauma Center Hirslanden, Clinic Hirslanden, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology Langgasse, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sonnenhofspital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sonnenhofspital, Bern, Switzerland.

Clinical trials showed that Tregs modulate graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, their ability to mediate anti-leukemic activity (graft-versus-leukemia [GvL]) is largely unknown. Enforced interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression converts human CD4(+) T cells into T regulatory type 1 (Tr1)-like (CD4(IL-10)) cells that suppress effector T cells in vitro and xenoGvHD in humanized mouse models. In the present study, we show that CD4(IL-10) cells mediate anti-leukemic effects in vitro and in vivo in a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-dependent but antigen-independent manner. The cytotoxicity mediated by CD4(IL-10) cells is granzyme B (GzB) dependent, is specific for CD13(+) target cells, and requires CD54 and CD112 expression on primary leukemic target blasts. CD4(IL-10) cells adoptively transferred in humanized mouse models directly mediate anti-tumor and anti-leukemic effects. In addition, when co-transferred with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD4(IL-10) cells contribute to the GvL activity but suppress xenoGvHD mediated by the PBMCs. These findings provide for the first time a strong rationale for CD4(IL-10) cell immunotherapy to prevent GvHD and promote GvL in allo-HSCT for myeloid malignancies.","['Locafaro, Grazia', 'Andolfi, Grazia', 'Russo, Fabio', 'Cesana, Luca', 'Spinelli, Antonello', 'Camisa, Barbara', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Lombardo, Angelo', 'Bondanza, Attilio', 'Roncarolo, Maria Grazia', 'Gregori, Silvia']","['Locafaro G', 'Andolfi G', 'Russo F', 'Cesana L', 'Spinelli A', 'Camisa B', 'Ciceri F', 'Lombardo A', 'Bondanza A', 'Roncarolo MG', 'Gregori S']","['San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Experimental Imaging Centre, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy; Vita Salute San Raffaele University, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Experimental Imaging Centre, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy; Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, ISCBRM, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

We have designed and constructed novel anti-CD19 CARs containing a scFv with fully human variable regions. T cells expressing these CARs specifically recognized CD19(+) target cells and carried out functions including degranulation, cytokine release, and proliferation. We compared CARs with CD28 costimulatory moieties along with hinge and transmembrane domains from either the human CD28 molecule or the human CD8alpha molecule. Compared with T cells expressing CARs with CD28 hinge and transmembrane domains, T cells expressing CARs with CD8alpha hinge and transmembrane domains produced lower levels of cytokines and exhibited lower levels of activation-induced cell death (AICD). Importantly, CARs with hinge and transmembrane regions from either CD8alpha or CD28 had similar abilities to eliminate established tumors in mice. In anti-CD19 CARs with CD28 costimulatory moieties, lower levels of inflammatory cytokine production and AICD are potential clinical advantages of CD8alpha hinge and transmembrane domains over CD28 hinge and transmembrane domains.","['Alabanza, Leah', 'Pegues, Melissa', 'Geldres, Claudia', 'Shi, Victoria', 'Wiltzius, Jed J W', 'Sievers, Stuart A', 'Yang, Shicheng', 'Kochenderfer, James N']","['Alabanza L', 'Pegues M', 'Geldres C', 'Shi V', 'Wiltzius JJW', 'Sievers SA', 'Yang S', 'Kochenderfer JN']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Kite Pharma, Inc., Santa Monica, CA 90404, USA.', 'Kite Pharma, Inc., Santa Monica, CA 90404, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Development of IO and tissue iron deposition can increase the risk of cardiac, hepatic, and endocrine toxicities, infection, and progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Iron chelation therapy (ICT) is an option for lower-risk MDS patients to reduce their degree of IO and possibly improve survival; use of these agents in thalassemia patients with TD and IO has been associated with reduced IO-associated complications and better survival. At present, there are several barriers to the regular use of ICT, such as a lack of randomized trial evidence and consistent guidance on diagnosis of IO and when to implement ICT, as well as barriers in adherence to/tolerability of ICT.","['Zeidan, Amer M', 'Pullarkat, Vinod A', 'Komrokji, Rami S']","['Zeidan AM', 'Pullarkat VA', 'Komrokji RS']","['Department of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, United States.

However, for some types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia, mortality rates have continued to rise, with chemoresistance in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) being a major contributing factor. Most cancer drug therapies act by inducing apoptosis in dividing cells but are ineffective in targeting quiescent LSCs. Niches in the bone marrow, known as leukemic niches, behave as ""sanctuaries"" where LSCs acquire drug resistance. This review explores the role of the bone marrow environment in the maintenance of LSCs and its contribution to chemoresistance and considers current research on the potential use of phytochemicals to overcome chemoresistance through the modulation of signaling pathways involved in the survival and death of leukemic clonal cells and/or leukemic stem cells. Phytochemicals from traditional Chinese medicine, namely baicalein, chrysin, wogonin (constituents of Scutellaria baicalensis; huang qin; ), curcumin (a constituent of Curcuma longa, jiang huang, ), and resveratrol (a constituent of Polygonum cuspidatum; hu zhang, ) have been shown to induce apoptosis in leukemic cell lines, with curcumin and resveratrol also causing cell death via the induction of autophagy (a nonapoptotic pathway). In order to be effective in eliminating LSCs, it is important to target signaling pathways (such as Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog). Resveratrol has been reported to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells through the inhibition of the Notch and Sonic hedgehog signaling pathways, therefore showing potential to affect LSCs. While these findings are of interest, there is a lack of reported research on the modulatory effect of phytochemicals on the autophagic cell death pathway in leukemia, and on the signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of LSCs, highlighting the need for further work in these areas.","['Owen, Helen C', 'Appiah, Sandra', 'Hasan, Noor', 'Ghali, Lucy', 'Elayat, Ghada', 'Bell, Celia']","['Owen HC', 'Appiah S', 'Hasan N', 'Ghali L', 'Elayat G', 'Bell C']","['Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, Hendon, London, United Kingdom.

In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of 134 primary ALL patient samples to comprehensively detect fusion transcripts. METHODS: We combined fusion gene detection with genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, gene expression profiling, and targeted sequencing to determine molecular signatures of emerging ALL subtypes. RESULTS: We identified 64 unique fusion events distributed among 80 individual patients, of which over 50% have not previously been reported in ALL. Although the majority of the fusion genes were found only in a single patient, we identified several recurrent fusion gene families defined by promiscuous fusion gene partners, such as ETV6, RUNX1, PAX5, and ZNF384, or recurrent fusion genes, such as DUX4-IGH. Our data show that patients harboring these fusion genes displayed characteristic genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression signatures in addition to distinct patterns in single nucleotide variants and recurrent copy number alterations. CONCLUSION: Our study delineates the fusion gene landscape in pediatric ALL, including both known and novel fusion genes, and highlights fusion gene families with shared molecular etiologies, which may provide additional information for prognosis and therapeutic options in the future.","['Marincevic-Zuniga, Yanara', 'Dahlberg, Johan', 'Nilsson, Sara', 'Raine, Amanda', 'Nystedt, Sara', 'Lindqvist, Carl Marten', 'Berglund, Eva C', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Cavelier, Lucia', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Nordlund, Jessica', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine']","['Marincevic-Zuniga Y', 'Dahlberg J', 'Nilsson S', 'Raine A', 'Nystedt S', 'Lindqvist CM', 'Berglund EC', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Cavelier L', 'Forestier E', 'Heyman M', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Nordlund J', 'Syvanen AC']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Clinical Genetics, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden.', ""Karolinska Institutet, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Oncology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. jessica.nordlund@medsci.uu.se.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170814,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCP-ALL', '*Fusion genes', '*Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*RNA sequencing', '*T-ALL', '*Translocation']",2017/08/16 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/08/16 06:00'],"['2017/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-017-0515-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-017-0515-y [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2017 Aug 14;10(1):148. doi: 10.1186/s13045-017-0515-y.,,,,PMC5557398,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, thioridazine alone does not induce apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (AMC-HN4), human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231), and human glioma (U87MG) cells. Therefore, we investigated whether combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin induces apoptosis. Combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin markedly induced apoptosis in cancer cells without inducing apoptosis in human normal mesangial cells and human normal umbilical vein cells (EA.hy926). We found that combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin had synergistic effects in AMC-HN4 cells. Among apoptosis-related proteins, thioridazine plus curcumin induced down-regulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational levels in a proteasome-dependent manner. Augmentation of proteasome activity was related to the up-regulation of proteasome subunit alpha 5 (PSMA5) expression in curcumin plus thioridazine-treated cells. Combined treatment with curcumin and thioridazine produced intracellular ROS in a NOX4-dependent manner, and ROS-mediated activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling played a critical role in the up-regulation of PSMA5 expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 inhibited apoptosis in thioridazine and curcumin-treated cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that thioridazine plus curcumin induces proteasome activity by up-regulating PSMA5 expression via NOX4-mediated ROS production and that down-regulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression post-translationally is involved in apoptosis.","['Seo, Seung Un', 'Kim, Tae Hwan', 'Kim, Dong Eun', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Seo SU', 'Kim TH', 'Kim DE', 'Min KJ', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.

However, little is known about the prevalence or severity of adenovirus infection in this population. Objective was to describe the characteristics, treatments and outcomes of adenovirus infection in children with newly diagnosed AML. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review based upon 2 multicenter cohort studies that focused on identifying risk factors for infection in children with AML. Inclusion criteria were patients with de novo AML who were </=18 years of age at diagnosis with a clinical specimen positive for adenovirus. RESULTS: Among the 235 patients with AML, 12 (5.1%) had positive adenovirus testing. The most common site of isolation was stool (n = 11, 91.6 %), and the most frequent symptom was diarrhea (n = 11, 91.6 %). Two patients received specific treatment for adenovirus, namely intravenous immunoglobulin only in 1 patient and both intravenous immunoglobulin and inhaled ribavirin in a second patient. In 11 patients, adenovirus resolved uneventfully without recurrence, including 10 that received no adenovirus-specific therapy. However, 1 patient developed sepsis syndrome in the setting of disseminated adenoviral infection and died from multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: In children with AML, adenovirus infection was rare and typically not associated with severe disease, even without specific treatment. However, disseminated and fatal disease can occur in this population. Further investigations are needed to identify pediatric AML patients at particular risk for severe adenovirus infection and to determine optimal treatment approaches in these patients.","['Renzi, Samuele', 'Ali, Salah', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Mitchell, David', 'Dix, David', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Price, Victoria', 'Science, Michelle', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Renzi S', 'Ali S', 'Portwine C', 'Mitchell D', 'Dix D', 'Lewis V', 'Price V', 'Science M', 'Sung L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*isolation & purification', 'Adenovirus Infections, Human/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Adolescent', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ribavirin/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors']",,,2017/08/15 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/INF.0000000000001723 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2018 Feb;37(2):135-137. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000001723.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular characteristics of HS and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) criteria for its diagnosis have not been established. METHODS: A case series of HS in 8 FNA samples from 6 patients was reviewed along with histopathologic and clinical data. Immunohistochemistry was performed on cell blocks (3 cases), core biopsies (5 cases), and surgical specimens (4 cases). Targeted-exome next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on surgical resection specimens in 4 cases. RESULTS: Four patients had a known history of hematolymphoid malignancy. Cytomorphologic features included variably cellular smears composed of large epithelioid cells with reniform nuclei and abundant vacuolated cytoplasm, in an inflammatory background, with occasional cytophagocytosis and lymphoglandular bodies. Marked pleomorphism, multinucleated monster cells, and binucleated histiocytoid cells with partially overlapping, eccentrically placed nuclei resembling Pac-Man were common. Most cases expressed histiocytic markers CD68 (6 of 7 cases), CD163 (5 of 5 cases), and PU.1 (3 of 4 cases). In 3 cases, NGS analysis revealed alterations in lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D)/mixed-lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2), a gene involved in chromatin regulation and previously implicated in the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Although diagnosing HS with FNA alone is extremely challenging, the presence of pleomorphic and epithelioid large cells with binucleation and/or multinucleation in an inflammatory background should prompt the diagnosis of HS with judicious use of confirmatory histiocytic lineage markers. The detection of recurrent KMT2D/MLL2 alterations implicates epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of HS and supports the notion of transdifferentiation from a genetically similar but phenotypically distinct tumor of a different lineage.

Assuming that leukemic stem cells (LSC) are resistant to chemotherapy and responsible for relapse, it might be clinically relevant to evaluate the expression level of MDR proteins in LSC and relate it to the clinical outcome. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 26 patients with de novo AML were labeled with antibodies to distinguish CD34+CD38-CD123+ LSC population and with antibodies against MDR1, BCRP, MDR3, MRP1, or LRP proteins. Multicolor flow cytometry was applied to evaluate the expression of MDR proteins in blasts and LSC. RESULTS: Nine of 26 patients with AML attained CR (30%). High negative correlation was found between MDR1 and LRP expression in blasts and the patient's remission. MDR proteins were expressed more frequently in LSC than in leukemic blasts. High negative correlation was also observed between remission achievement and MRP1 expression in LSC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data present for the very first time the high negative correlation between MRP1 protein expression in LSC and AML patients' remission. It does strongly suggest that MRP1 expression in LSC is an adverse prognostic marker in patients with de novo AML.","['Paprocka, Maria', 'Bielawska-Pohl, Aleksandra', 'Rossowska, Joanna', 'Krawczenko, Agnieszka', 'Dus, Danuta', 'Kielbinski, Marek', 'Haus, Olga', 'Podolak-Dawidziak, Maria', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']","['Paprocka M', 'Bielawska-Pohl A', 'Rossowska J', 'Krawczenko A', 'Dus D', 'Kielbinski M', 'Haus O', 'Podolak-Dawidziak M', 'Kuliczkowski K']","['Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, The Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, The Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, The Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, The Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, The Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170929,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCRP', 'MDR1', 'MDR3', 'MRP1 and LRP', 'leukemic stem cells', 'multidrug resistance proteins', 'prognostic markers']",2017/08/15 06:00,2018/06/02 06:00,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12938 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Nov;99(5):415-422. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12938.

BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have been developed and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely unknown. Here we report that cullin-3(SPOP) earmarks BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer bearing SPOP mutations.","['Dai, Xiangpeng', 'Gan, Wenjian', 'Li, Xiaoning', 'Wang, Shangqian', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Huang, Ling', 'Liu,

However, adverse events, mainly mediated by the toxin component of the conjugated antibodies, cause treatment discontinuation in many patients. Targeting CD30 with T cells expressing a CD30-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) may reduce the side effects and augment antitumor activity. METHODS: We conducted a phase I dose escalation study in which 9 patients with relapsed/refractory HL or ALCL were infused with autologous T cells that were gene-modified with a retroviral vector to express the CD30-specific CAR (CD30.CAR-Ts) encoding the CD28 costimulatory endodomain. Three dose levels, from 0.2 x 108 to 2 x 108 CD30.CAR-Ts/m2, were infused without a conditioning regimen. All other therapy for malignancy was discontinued at least 4 weeks before CD30.CAR-T infusion. Seven patients had previously experienced disease progression while being treated with brentuximab. RESULTS: No toxicities attributable to CD30.CAR-Ts were observed. Of 7 patients with relapsed HL, 1 entered complete response (CR) lasting more than 2.5 years after the second infusion of CD30.CAR-Ts, 1 remained in continued CR for almost 2 years, and 3 had transient stable disease. Of 2 patients with ALCL, 1 had a CR that persisted 9 months after the fourth infusion of CD30.CAR-Ts. CD30.CAR-T expansion in peripheral blood peaked 1 week after infusion, and CD30.CAR-Ts remained detectable for over 6 weeks. Although CD30 may also be expressed by normal activated T cells, no patients developed impaired virus-specific immunity. CONCLUSION: CD30.CAR-Ts are safe and can lead to clinical responses in patients with HL and ALCL, indicating that further assessment of this therapy is warranted.

PCNSL incidence was higher in Asians/Pacific Islanders than non-Hispanic whites (aIRR = 2.09); after induction immunosuppression with alemtuzumab (aIRR = 3.12), monoclonal antibodies (aIRR = 1.83), or polyclonal antibodies (aIRR = 2.03); in recipients who were Epstein-Barr virus-seronegative at the time of transplant and at risk of primary infection (aIRR = 1.95); and within the first 1.5 years after transplant. Compared to other recipients, those with PCNSL had increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 11.79) or graft failure/retransplantation (aHR = 3.24). Recipients with PCNSL also had higher mortality than those with systemic NHL (aHR = 1.48). In conclusion, PCNSL risk is highly elevated among transplant recipients, and it carries a poor prognosis.","['Mahale, Parag', 'Shiels, Meredith S', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Mahale P', 'Shiels MS', 'Lynch CF', 'Engels EA']","['Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, The University of Iowa College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20170902,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplant Recipients/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia: hematogenous/leukemia/lymphoma', '*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia: registry/incidence', '*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia: risk factors', '*clinical research/practice', '*hematology/oncology', '*infection and infectious agents-viral: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)', '*organ transplantation in general']",2017/08/15 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajt.14465 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2018 Feb;18(2):453-461. doi: 10.1111/ajt.14465.

While the role and expression pattern of histone methyltransferases (HMTs), especially mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) families on DCM are unclear. To this end, twelve normal and fifteen DCM heart samples were included in the present study. A murine cardiac remodelling model was induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of MLL families in the mouse and human left ventricles. The mRNA level of MLL3 was significantly increased in the mouse hearts treated by TAC surgery. Compared with normal hearts, higher mRNA and protein level of MLL3 was detected in the DCM hearts, and its expression level was closely associated with left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, the expression level of other MLL families (MLL, MLL2, MLL4, MLL5, SETD1A, and SETD1B) had no obvious change between control and DCM hearts or remodeled mouse hearts. Furthermore, the di-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) but not H3K4me3 was significantly increased in the DCM hearts. The protein levels of Smad3, GATA4, EGR1, which might regulate by MLL3, were remarkably elevated in the DCM hearts. Our hitherto unrecognized findings indicate that MLL3 has a potential role on pathological processes of DCM via regulating H3K4me2 and the expression of Smad3, GATA4, and EGR1.","['Jiang, Ding-Sheng', 'Yi, Xin', 'Li, Rui', 'Su, Yun-Shu', 'Wang, Jing', 'Chen, Min-Lai', 'Liu, Li-Gang', 'Hu, Min', 'Cheng, Cai', 'Zheng, Ping', 'Zhu, Xue-Hai', 'Wei, Xiang']","['Jiang DS', 'Yi X', 'Li R', 'Su YS', 'Wang J', 'Chen ML', 'Liu LG', 'Hu M', 'Cheng C', 'Zheng P', 'Zhu XH', 'Wei X']","['Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Education, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Health, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Cardiovascular Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Cardiology, Wuhan 430060, PR China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Education, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Health, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Education, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Health, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170809,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/metabolism', 'Female', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Heart Ventricles/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Smad3 Protein/metabolism', 'Ventricular Function, Left', 'Ventricular Remodeling/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cardiology', '*cardiovascular disease', '*gene expression', '*pathology', '*signal transduction']",2017/08/15 06:00,2019/01/05 06:00,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['molmed.2017.00012 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2017.00012 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2017 Oct;23:196-203. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2017.00012.

With its approval, it was immediately clear to Novartis that this breakthrough therapy would require an innovative approach to worldwide access, with special consideration of low- and middle-income countries. Lack of government reimbursement, universal health care, or health insurance coverage, few trained specialty physicians or diagnostic services, and poor health care infrastructure were, and continue to be, contributing barriers to access to treatment in low- and middle-income countries. The Glivec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) is an international drug donation program established by Novartis Pharma AG and implemented in partnership with The Max Foundation, a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization. GIPAP was established in 2001, essentially in parallel with the first approval of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia. Since 2001, GIPAP has made imatinib accessible to all medically and financially eligible patients within 80 countries on an ongoing basis as long as their physicians prescribe it and no other means of access exists. To date, more than 49,000 patients have benefited from GIPAP, and 2.3 million monthly doses of imatinib have been approved through the program. GIPAP represents an innovative drug donation model that has set the standard for access programs for other targeted or innovative therapies. The purpose of this article is to describe the structure of GIPAP, as well as important lessons that have contributed to the success of the program. This article may assist other companies with the development of successful and far-reaching patient assistance programs in the future.","['Garcia-Gonzalez, Pat', 'Boultbee, Paula', 'Epstein, David']","['Garcia-Gonzalez P', 'Boultbee P', 'Epstein D']","[', The Max Foundation; , PTB Consulting LLC, Seattle, WA; and , Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ.', ', The Max Foundation; , PTB Consulting LLC, Seattle, WA; and , Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ.', ', The Max Foundation; , PTB Consulting LLC, Seattle, WA; and , Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150923,United States,J Glob Oncol,Journal of global oncology,101674751,,,,,,2015/09/23 00:00,2015/09/23 00:01,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/23 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1200/JGO.2015.000570 [doi]', 'X0570 [pii]']",epublish,J Glob Oncol. 2015 Sep 23;1(1):37-45. doi: 10.1200/JGO.2015.000570. eCollection 2015 Oct.,,,,PMC5551649,"['The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this', 'manuscript.

Because of this, a group of Canadian leukemia experts has produced an update to the Canadian Consensus Guidelines that were published in 2013, with several new agents recommended, subject to availability. Recent studies have supported the survival benefit of induction chemotherapy for patients under age 80, except those with major co-morbidities or those with adverse risk cytogenetics who are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Midostaurin should be added to induction therapy for patients up to age 70 with a FLT3 mutation, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin for de novo AML up to age 70 with favorable or intermediate risk cytogenetics. Daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2) is the recommended dose for 3+7 induction therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia should be treated with arsenic trioxide plus all-trans retinoic acid, regardless of age, with cytotoxic therapy added upfront only for those with initial white blood count > 10. HSCT may be considered for selected suitable patients up to age 70-75. Haploidentical donor transplants may be considered for older patients. For non-induction candidates, azacitidine is recommended for those with adverse risk cytogenetics, while either a hypomethylating agent (HMA) or low-dose cytarabine can be used for others. HMA may also be used for relapsed/refractory disease after chemotherapy. For patients with secondary AML, CPX-351 is recommended for fit patients age 60-75.","['Brandwein, Joseph M', 'Zhu, Nancy', 'Kumar, Rajat', 'Leber, Brian', 'Sabloff, Mitchell', 'Sandhu, Irwindeep', 'Kassis, Jeannine', 'Olney, Harold J', 'Elemary, Mohamed', 'Schuh, Andre C']","['Brandwein JM', 'Zhu N', 'Kumar R', 'Leber B', 'Sabloff M', 'Sandhu I', 'Kassis J', 'Olney HJ', 'Elemary M', 'Schuh AC']","['Department of Medicine, University of AlbertaEdmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of AlbertaEdmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of ManitobaWinnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, McMaster UniversityHamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of OttawaOttawa, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of AlbertaEdmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de MontrealMontreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de MontrealMontreal, QC, Canada.', 'Saskatoon Cancer Centre, University of SaskatchewanSaskatoon, SK, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of TorontoToronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170725,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'co-morbidities', 'cytogenetics', 'elderly patients', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'hypomethylating agents']",2017/08/15 06:00,2017/08/15 06:01,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2017 Jul 25;7(4):30-40. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5545212,"['JM Brandwein: Advisory Board & Honoraria - Celgene, Lundbeck, Pfizer, Novartis,', 'Paladin.

The median survival of T-PLL patients is <2 years and clinical trials are difficult to execute. Here we systematically explored the diversity of drug responses in T-PLL patient samples using an ex vivo drug sensitivity and resistance testing platform and correlated the findings with somatic mutations and gene expression profiles. Intriguingly, all T-PLL samples were sensitive to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor SNS-032, which overcame stromal-cell-mediated protection and elicited robust p53-activation and apoptosis. Across all patients, the most effective classes of compounds were histone deacetylase, phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin, heat-shock protein 90 and BH3-family protein inhibitors as well as p53 activators, indicating previously unexplored, novel targeted approaches for treating T-PLL. Although Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription factor (JAK-STAT) pathway mutations were common in T-PLL (71% of patients), JAK-STAT inhibitor responses were not directly linked to those or other T-PLL-specific lesions. Overall, we found that genetic markers do not readily translate into novel effective therapeutic vulnerabilities. In conclusion, novel classes of compounds with high efficacy in T-PLL were discovered with the comprehensive ex vivo drug screening platform warranting further studies of synergisms and clinical testing.","['Andersson, E I', 'Putzer, S', 'Yadav, B', 'Dufva, O', 'Khan, S', 'He, L', 'Sellner, L', 'Schrader, A', 'Crispatzu, G', 'Oles, M', 'Zhang, H', 'Adnan-Awad, S', 'Lagstrom, S', 'Bellanger,

From July 2002 to March 2012, 1551 newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase were randomized into a 5-arm study. The study was powered to detect a survival difference of 5% at 5 years. After a median observation time of 9.5 years, 10-year overall survival was 82%, 10-year progression-free survival was 80% and 10-year relative survival was 92%. Survival between IM400 mg and any experimental arm was not different. In a multivariate analysis, risk group, major-route chromosomal aberrations, comorbidities, smoking and treatment center (academic vs other) influenced survival significantly, but not any form of treatment optimization. Patients reaching the molecular response milestones at 3, 6 and 12 months had a significant survival advantage. For responders, monotherapy with IM400 mg provides a close to normal life expectancy independent of the time to response. Survival is more determined by patients' and disease factors than by initial treatment selection. Although improvements are also needed for refractory disease, more life-time can currently be gained by carefully addressing non-CML determinants of survival.","['Hehlmann, R', 'Lauseker, M', 'Saussele, S', 'Pfirrmann, M', 'Krause, S', 'Kolb, H J', 'Neubauer, A', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Nerl, C', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Baerlocher, G M', 'Heim, D', 'Brummendorf, T H', 'Fabarius, A', 'Haferlach, C', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Muller, M C', 'Jeromin, S', 'Proetel, U', 'Kohlbrenner, K', 'Voskanyan, A', 'Rinaldetti, S', 'Seifarth, W', 'Spiess, B', 'Balleisen, L', 'Goebeler, M C', 'Hanel, M', 'Ho, A', 'Dengler, J', 'Falge, C', 'Kanz, L', 'Kremers, S', 'Burchert, A', 'Kneba, M', 'Stegelmann, F', 'Kohne, C A', 'Lindemann, H W', 'Waller, C F', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Spiekermann, K', 'Berdel, W E', 'Muller, L', 'Edinger, M', 'Mayer, J', 'Beelen, D W', 'Bentz, M', 'Link, H', 'Hertenstein, B', 'Fuchs, R', 'Wernli, M', 'Schlegel, F', 'Schlag, R', 'de Wit, M', 'Trumper, L', 'Hebart, H', 'Hahn, M', 'Thomalla, J', 'Scheid, C', 'Schafhausen, P', 'Verbeek, W', 'Eckart, M J', 'Gassmann, W', 'Pezzutto, A', 'Schenk, M', 'Brossart, P', 'Geer, T', 'Bildat, S', 'Schafer, E', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Hasford, J']","['Hehlmann R', 'Lauseker M', 'Saussele S', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Krause S', 'Kolb HJ', 'Neubauer A', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Nerl C', 'Gratwohl A', 'Baerlocher GM', 'Heim D', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Fabarius A', 'Haferlach C', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Muller MC', 'Jeromin S', 'Proetel U', 'Kohlbrenner K', 'Voskanyan A', 'Rinaldetti S', 'Seifarth W', 'Spiess B', 'Balleisen L', 'Goebeler MC', 'Hanel M', 'Ho A', 'Dengler J', 'Falge C', 'Kanz L', 'Kremers S', 'Burchert A', 'Kneba M', 'Stegelmann F', 'Kohne CA', 'Lindemann HW', 'Waller CF', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Spiekermann K', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller L', 'Edinger M', 'Mayer J', 'Beelen DW', 'Bentz M', 'Link H', 'Hertenstein B', 'Fuchs R', 'Wernli M', 'Schlegel F', 'Schlag R', 'de Wit M', 'Trumper L', 'Hebart H', 'Hahn M', 'Thomalla J', 'Scheid C', 'Schafhausen P', 'Verbeek W', 'Eckart MJ', 'Gassmann W', 'Pezzutto A', 'Schenk M', 'Brossart P', 'Geer T', 'Bildat S', 'Schafer E', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hasford J']","['III.

However, the clinical significance of these alterations is still not well defined. In this study, we have integrated the analysis of targeted next-generation sequencing of 106 genes and genomic copy number alterations (CNA) in 150 DLBCL. The clinically significant findings were validated in an independent cohort of 111 patients. Germinal center B-cell and activated B-cell DLBCL had a differential profile of mutations, altered pathogenic pathways and CNA. Mutations in genes of the NOTCH pathway and tumor suppressor genes (TP53/CDKN2A), but not individual genes, conferred an unfavorable prognosis, confirmed in the independent validation cohort. A gene expression profiling analysis showed that tumors with NOTCH pathway mutations had a significant modulation of downstream target genes, emphasizing the relevance of this pathway in DLBCL. An in silico drug discovery analysis recognized 69 (46%) cases carrying at least one genomic alteration considered a potential target of drug response according to early clinical trials or preclinical assays in DLBCL or other lymphomas. In conclusion, this study identifies relevant pathways and mutated genes in DLBCL and recognizes potential targets for new intervention strategies.","['Karube, K', 'Enjuanes, A', 'Dlouhy, I', 'Jares,

Nevertheless, acquired TKI resistance remains a major problem in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and TKIs are less effective against Ph(+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). GAB2, a scaffolding adaptor that binds and activates SHP2, is essential for leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1, and a GAB2 mutant lacking SHP2 binding cannot mediate leukemogenesis. Using a genetic loss-of-function approach and bone marrow transplantation models for CML and BCR-ABL1(+) B-ALL, we show that SHP2 is required for BCR-ABL1-evoked myeloid and lymphoid neoplasia. Ptpn11 deletion impairs initiation and maintenance of CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm, and compromises induction of BCR-ABL1(+) B-ALL. SHP2, and specifically, its SH2 domains, PTP activity and C-terminal tyrosines, are essential for BCR-ABL1(+), but not WT, pre-B-cell proliferation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) / extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is regulated by SHP2 in WT and BCR-ABL1(+) pre-B cells, but is only required for the proliferation of BCR-ABL1(+) cells. SHP2 is required for SRC family kinase (SFK) activation only in BCR-ABL1(+) pre-B cells. RNAseq reveals distinct SHP2-dependent transcriptional programs in BCR-ABL1(+) and WT pre-B cells. Our results suggest that SHP2, via SFKs and ERK, represses MXD3/4 to facilitate a MYC-dependent proliferation program in BCR-ABL1-transformed pre-B cells.","['Gu, S', 'Sayad, A', 'Chan, G', 'Yang, W', 'Lu, Z', 'Virtanen, C', 'Van Etten, R A', 'Neel, B G']","['Gu S', 'Sayad A', 'Chan G', 'Yang W', 'Lu Z', 'Virtanen C', 'Van Etten RA', 'Neel BG']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, Brown University Alpert Medical School, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170814,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'src Homology Domains/genetics']",,,2017/08/15 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017250 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.250 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jan;32(1):203-213. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.250.

Here, we report that genome binding of Lamin B1, a component of the nuclear envelope involved in epigenetic chromatin regulation, is reduced during B-cell activation and formation of lymphoid germinal centres. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-Seq analysis showed that kappa and heavy variable immunoglobulin domains were released from the Lamin B1 suppressive environment when SHM was induced in B cells. RNA interference-mediated reduction of Lamin B1 resulted in spontaneous SHM as well as kappa-light chain aberrant surface expression. Finally, Lamin B1 expression level correlated with progression-free and overall survival in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and was strongly involved in the transformation of follicular lymphoma. In summary, here we report that Lamin B1 is a negative epigenetic regulator of SHM in normal B-cells and a 'mutational gatekeeper', suppressing the aberrant mutations that drive lymphoid malignancy.","['Klymenko, T', 'Bloehdorn, J', 'Bahlo, J', 'Robrecht, S', 'Akylzhanova, G', 'Cox, K', 'Estenfelder, S', 'Wang, J', 'Edelmann, J', 'Strefford, J C', 'Wojdacz, T K', 'Fischer, K', 'Hallek, M', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Cragg, M', 'Gribben, J', 'Braun, A']","['Klymenko T', 'Bloehdorn J', 'Bahlo J', 'Robrecht S', 'Akylzhanova G', 'Cox K', 'Estenfelder S', 'Wang J', 'Edelmann J', 'Strefford JC', 'Wojdacz TK', 'Fischer K', 'Hallek M', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Cragg M', 'Gribben J', 'Braun A']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University, London, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University, London, UK.', 'Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University, London, UK.', 'Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170814,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (lamin B1)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Lamin Type B/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/pathology', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics']",,,2017/08/15 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/08/15 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017255 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.255 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Feb;32(2):364-375. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.255.

We evaluated the incidence of MSM after successful treatment of SCLC and compared survival between patients with SCLC in whom MSM developed and those in whom it did not. METHODS: Selection criteria were a diagnosis of limited-stage SCLC and receipt of at least 45 Gy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy at a single institution in 1985-2012. MSM was defined as a tumor of a different histologic type than the primary that appeared more than 2 years after the diagnosis of SCLC. RESULTS: Of 704 patients identified, 32 were excluded for lack of follow-up, 48 for having SCLC as MSM after treatment of another type of cancer, 37 for nonmelanoma skin cancer as MSM, and 46 for MSM within 2 years after SCLC diagnosis. Of the remaining 541 patients, 346 had recurrent SCLC, 180 had no second malignancy and no recurrence, and 15 (2.8%) had MSM (13 in a lung [eight adenocarcinomas and five squamous cell carcinomas], one sarcoma, and one acute myeloid leukemia). All 15 patients with MSM achieved complete response to the SCLC treatment. Overall survival was longer for patients with MSM than for patients with no other malignancies and no recurrence, with 10-year rates of 61.9% (95% confidence interval: 30.0%-82.6%) and 29.9% (95% confidence interval: 21.5%-38.6%), respectively (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors after treatment for SCLC should be made aware of the risk for MSM and the necessity of follow-up.","['Kono, Miho', 'Allen, Pamela K', 'Lin, Steven H', 'Wei, Xiong', 'Jeter, Melenda D', 'Welsh, James W', 'Cox, James D', 'Komaki, Ritsuko']","['Kono M', 'Allen PK', 'Lin SH', 'Wei X', 'Jeter MD', 'Welsh JW', 'Cox JD', 'Komaki R']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas M.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) and calcitriol strongly upregulate 5-LO expression during myeloid cell differentiation and MLL-AF4 has been shown to strongly activate the 5-LO promoter. Here, we investigated the role of TGFbeta/SMAD signalling in 5-LO promoter activation. We identified two functional SMAD binding elements in the proximal part of the 5-LO promoter which significantly induce 5-LO promoter activity via TGFbeta and SMAD3/4. Since aberrant 5-LO gene expression has been linked with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) which is characterized by the presence of MLL fusion proteins (e.g. MLL-AF4), we also investigated the influence of TGFbeta/SMADs on MLL- and MLL-AF4-mediated 5-LO promoter activation. Our data show that induction of 5-LO promoter activity by SMAD3/4 is MLL-dependent and that knockdown of the MLL complex component MEN1 attenuates the SMAD effect. Our data suggest that induction of 5-LO gene expression by TGFbeta is at least in part due to stimulation of transcript initiation.","['Saul, Meike J', 'Groher, Florian', 'Hegewald, Anett B', 'Muller-McNicoll, Michaela', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Suess, Beatrix', 'Steinhilber, Dieter']","['Saul MJ', 'Groher F', 'Hegewald AB', 'Muller-McNicoll M', 'Marschalek R', 'Suess B', 'Steinhilber D']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Goethe University Frankfurt, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, 60438 Frankfurt/M., Germany; Department of Biology, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Schnittspahnstr. 10, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Schnittspahnstr. 10, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Schnittspahnstr. 10, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Goethe University Frankfurt, Max-von-Laue-Str. 13, 60438 Frankfurt/M., Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, 60438 Frankfurt/M., Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Schnittspahnstr. 10, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany.

These data suggest that CH occurs in an age-dependent manner and that specific perturbations can enhance fitness of clonal hematopoietic stem cells, which can impact outcome through progression to hematologic malignancies and through cell-non-autonomous effects on solid tumor biology.","['Coombs, Catherine C', 'Zehir, Ahmet', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Kishtagari, Ashwin', 'Syed, Aijazuddin', 'Jonsson, Philip', 'Hyman, David M', 'Solit, David B', 'Robson, Mark E', 'Baselga, Jose', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Ladanyi, Marc', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Berger, Michael F']","['Coombs CC', 'Zehir A', 'Devlin SM', 'Kishtagari A', 'Syed A', 'Jonsson P', 'Hyman DM', 'Solit DB', 'Robson ME', 'Baselga J', 'Arcila ME', 'Ladanyi M', 'Tallman MS', 'Levine RL', 'Berger MF']","['Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Developmental Therapeutics Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Genitourinary Oncology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Breast Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Medicine, Hereditary Cancer and Genetics Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Breast Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Center for Hematologic Malignancies, New York, NY 10065, USA.

However, reports of cardiovascular toxicities caused by nilotinib have recently raised critical concerns. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVEs) and frequency of asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) after long-term exposure to nilotinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present retrospective cohort, we evaluated the incidence of CVEs in 63 CML patients treated with nilotinib. The results of Doppler ultrasound examination of the carotid and vertebral and lower extremity arteries with ankle-brachial index measurements were collected in asymptomatic patients. The clinical outcome was a composite endpoint of PAD, acute coronary events, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with a median age of 60 years were followed up for a median duration of 63 months. After a median nilotinib exposure of 49.30 months (range, 7.00-117.95 months), for a total exposure of 178.7 patient-years, 6 patients (9%) had experienced the clinical outcome. Four patients (8%) had abnormal arterial leg Doppler ultrasound findings. No significant lesions were reported in carotid/vertebral artery ultrasound examinations. Together, hypertension and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > 2 mmol/L significantly increased the risk of CVEs or abnormal ultrasound findings (odds ratio, 37.65; 95% confidence interval, 4.06-348.9). CONCLUSION: The incidence of CVEs and the frequency of asymptomatic PAD in this population was low, and CVEs were associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Aggressive risk factor modification and applying standard definitions for measuring cardiovascular outcomes might have contributed to the findings. Further prospective and adequately powered studies are needed to explore the effect of the cardiovascular risk profile on CVEs in CML patients taking nilotinib.","['Aghel, Nazanin', 'Lipton, Jeffrey Howard', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan', 'Delgado, Diego Hernan']","['Aghel N', 'Lipton JH', 'Atenafu EG', 'Kim DDH', 'Delgado DH']","['Division of Cardiology, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Liver enlargement and elevation of liver enzymes related to specific involvement by the underlying disease are well-recognized features in these patients. In CLL, the differential diagnosis of liver disorders is broad and includes liver infiltration by leukemic cells, immunologic manifestations associated with CLL, primary and secondary hepatic malignancies, drug-induced hepatotoxicity, infections, and Richter transformation. The above conditions can cause serious and even fatal complications such as acute liver failure. The aim of this study was to summarize all available published literature on hepatic manifestations encountered in CLL. This review contains sections on liver enlargement because of leukemic infiltration, autoimmune-induced hepatic dysfunction, acute liver failure, drug-induced liver toxicity, and associated malignancies. A high index of clinical suspicion and appropriate diagnostic evaluation, including liver biopsy in special circumstances, are important for both accurate diagnosis and deciding on the most appropriate treatment to prevent the development of fatal complications of acute liver failure.","['Kreiniz, Natalia', 'Beyar Katz, Ofrat', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Tadmor, Tamar']","['Kreiniz N', 'Beyar Katz O', 'Polliack A', 'Tadmor T']","['Hematology Unit, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Department, Hadassah University Hospital, Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.

Unfortunately, certain tumor types have remained resistant to conventional surgical, radiotherapy and chemotherapy combinations, and relapsing and/or refractory disease remains associated with dismal outcomes. Recently, renewed attention has been given to the role for immunotherapies in pediatric oncology. In fact, these combine several attractive features, including (but possibly not limited to) the specificity for cancer cells, potentially in vivo persistence and longevity, and potency against refractory disease. In this narrative review designed for the academic pediatrician, we will concisely review the biological underpinnings behind the immunological therapy of pediatric neoplasms and illustrate the current humoral, cellular approaches, and novel drugs targeting the immune checkpoint, oncolytic viruses, and tumor vaccines. We will also comment on the future directions, challenges, and open questions faced by the field. What is Known: * Cancer immunotherapy drives immune cells and its humoral weaponry to eliminate tumor cells. * This occurs by recognizing antigens ideally expressed only on tumoral, but not normal/healthy, cells. What is New: * Clinical immunotherapy trials have shown responses in children with relapsing/refractory neoplasms. * Novel humoral/cellular immunotherapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic viruses, and tumor vaccines are currently being investigated in pediatric oncology.","['Ceppi, Francesco', 'Beck-Popovic, Maja', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Renella, Raffaele']","['Ceppi F', 'Beck-Popovic M', 'Bourquin JP', 'Renella R']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Research Laboratory & Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Division of Pediatrics, Department Woman-Mother-Child, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Research Laboratory & Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Division of Pediatrics, Department Woman-Mother-Child, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', ""Leukemia Research Program and Division of Pediatric Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Research Laboratory & Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Division of Pediatrics, Department Woman-Mother-Child, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.

Likewise, the role of primary antimicrobial prophylaxis is unknown. In this retrospective, single-center study, we compare the impact of prophylaxis on the incidence of infection and morbidity in all consecutive higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, during the first 4 azacitidine cycles. Seventy-six patients, corresponding to 283 azacitidine cycles, were studied. There were infectious events in 43% of the patients. Development of infections led to more hospital admissions, increased red blood cells and platelet requirements, and a delay in subsequent cycles. Median overall survival was comparable between patients with or without infections. In the multivariate analysis, a neutrophil count below 0.5 x 10(9)/L (OR 12.5 [2.6-50]) and antimicrobial prophylaxis (OR 0.1 [0.02-04]) were independent factors for the development of infection. We conclude that infectious events have a significant impact in the early clinical course of azacitidine-treated patients by increasing hospital admissions and transfusion requirements. Antimicrobial prophylaxis may prevent infections, leading to a decreased need for supportive care in these patients with poor outcome.","['Lorenzana, Natalia', 'Avila, Laura Francisca', 'Alonso, Sara', 'Colado, Enrique', 'Bernal, Teresa']","['Lorenzana N', 'Avila LF', 'Alonso S', 'Colado E', 'Bernal T']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.

We also present exhaustive biochemical and in vitro analyses in support of our thesis. Analyzing the structure-activity relationship revealed a steric requirement for maximum potency. Effective inhibitors of Puromycin-Sensitive Aminopeptidase (PSA) are disclosed here.

Here we present a case of a pregnant woman who underwent 5 thrombocytaphereses using Spectra Optia device to reduce circulating platelets (PLT) count and prepare for Cesarian section. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMED TREATMENT: A 39-year-old woman with diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was treated with interferon because of too high PLT count. The treatment was well tolerated but the effect was not satisfactory (PLT count remained high). Because of high risk of bleeding during childbirth, the healthcare providers decided to perform thrombocytapheresis to reduce circulating PLT count below 1000x10E3/mul, and to prepare the patient for a planned Cesarean section. The results are presented as mean+/-SD. RESULTS: Five therapeutic aphereses procedures were performed, with a Spectra Optia device (TerumoBCT). A mean of 1.3+/-0.3 total blood volume was processed and we observed a mean PLT drop of 42.3+/-17.7%. Each apheresis procedure resulted in a PLT level </=1000x10E3/mul. PLT CE1 was high 50.6+/-2.6% and reproducible. The white blood cell (WBC) loss was low (18.5%+/-11.0%). No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic platelet depletion using the Spectra Optia Apheresis System can be effective and safe during pregnancy. Thrombocytapheresis procedures were reproducible and Spectra Optia system successfully adjusted settings to each procedure conditions. Thrombocytapheresis seems to be a viable and safe option even in pregnant women.","['Malachowski, Roman', 'Grzybowska-Izydorczyk, Olga', 'Besson, Nelly', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Nowicki, Mateusz', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka']","['Malachowski R', 'Grzybowska-Izydorczyk O', 'Besson N', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Nowicki M', 'Wierzbowska A']","['Copernicus Memorial Hospital in Lodz Comprehensive Center and Traumatology, ul.

Advances in conditioning regimens, supportive care, and the use of alternative donor sources have greatly expanded access to this therapy. In this review, we summarize the challenges and unique biological aspects of treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in this group of patients older than 60years. We also highlight areas of ongoing research including measurement of residual disease prior to and following transplant, post-remission maintenance therapy, and natural killer cell immunotherapy.

There has been an explosion of innovative targeted agents in the past years. This review discusses current knowledge on the etiology of indolent B-cell lymphomas with respect to the role of micro-organisms, auto-immune diseases, and deregulated pathways caused by mutations. In particular, knowledge on the mutational landscape of indolent B-cell lymphomas has strongly increased in recent years and harbors great promise for more accurate decision making in the current wide range of therapeutic options. Despite this promise, only in chronic lymphocytic leukemia the detection of TP53 mutations and/or del17p currently have a direct effect on treatment decisions. Nevertheless, it is expected that in the near future the role of genetic testing will increase for prediction of response to targeted treatment as well as for more accurate prediction of prognosis in indolent B-cell lymphomas.","['van den Brand, Michiel', 'Scheijen, Blanca', 'Hess, Corine J', 'van Krieken, J Han Jm', 'Groenen, Patricia J T A']","['van den Brand M', 'Scheijen B', 'Hess CJ', 'van Krieken JHJ', 'Groenen PJTA']","['Department of Pathology, Radboud university medical center, Geert Grooteplein Zuid 10, 6525GA Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Pathology-DNA, location Rijnstate, Wagnerlaan 55, 6815AD Arnhem, The Netherlands.

However, there is disagreement over how widely these therapies should be used in place of standard chemo-immunotherapy (CIT). We investigated whether stratification on the length of the interval between first-line (T1) and second-line (T2) treatments could identify a subgroup of older patients with relapsed CLL/SLL with an expectation of normal overall survival, and for whom CIT could be an acceptable treatment choice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed CLL/SLL who received T2 were identified from the SEER-Medicare Linked Database. Five-year relative survival (RS5; ie, the ratio of observed survival to expected survival based on population life tables) was assessed after stratifying patients on the interval between T1 and T2. We then validated our findings in the Mayo Clinic CLL Database. RESULTS: Among 1974 SEER-Medicare patients (median age = 77 years) who received T2 for relapsed CLL/SLL, longer time-to-retreatment was associated with a modestly improved prognosis (P = .01). However, even among those retreated >/= 3 years after T1, survival was poor compared with the general population (RS5 = 0.50 or lower in SEER-Medicare). Similar patterns were observed in the younger Mayo validation cohort, although prognosis was better overall among the Mayo patients, and patients with favorable fluorescence in situ hybridization retreated >/= 3 years after T1 had close to normal expected survival (RS5 = 0.87). CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to quantify the degree to which targeted therapies provide meaningful improvements over CIT in long-term outcomes for older patients with relapsed CLL/SLL.","['Ammann, Eric M', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Larson, Melissa C', 'Wright, Kara B', 'McDowell, Bradley D', 'Link, Brian K', 'Chrischilles, Elizabeth A']","['Ammann EM', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Larson MC', 'Wright KB', 'McDowell BD', 'Link BK', 'Chrischilles EA']","['Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.

Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that reestablish the disease through self-renewal. Self-renewal is the ability of a stem cell to produce copies of itself and give rise to progeny cells. Therefore, therapeutic strategies eradicating LSCs are essential to prevent relapse and achieve long-term remission in AML. AML is a heterogeneous disease both at phenotypic and genotypic levels, and this heterogeneity extends to LSCs. Classical studies in AML have aimed at characterization of the bulk tumor population, thereby masking cellular heterogeneity. Single-cell approaches provide a novel opportunity to elucidate molecular mechanisms in heterogeneous diseases such as AML. In recent years, major advancements in single-cell measurement systems have revolutionized our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML and enabled the characterization of LSCs. Identifying the molecular mechanisms critical to AML LSCs will aid in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to combat this deadly disease.","['Gupta, Soumyasri Das', 'Sachs, Zohar']","['Gupta SD', 'Sachs Z']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.

We achieved efficient retroviral vector transduction of primary human NK cells that were stimulated by a combination of IL-2 and engineered K562 cells expressing membrane-bound IL-21. The activated NK cells were in less differentiated state and expressed NK cell activation receptors NKG2D, NKp30, CD16, and were highly HLA-DR-positive. This NK cell population was highly susceptible to the transduction by both GFP- and NGFR-expressing retroviral vectors, with transduction efficiency exceeding 50%. More mature CD57(+) NK cell population was generally resistant to retroviral vector transduction because of poor response to the stimulation.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive disorder which accounts for 15% of pediatric ALL. To evaluate the contribution of immunological factors on T-ALL survival, we measured Th1, Th2, Th17 cytokines and soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) levels in bone marrow from 32 Brazilian children at diagnosis (D0), after induction (D19) and after consolidation (D49) of the chemotherapy phase. Data were analyzed using non-parametric tests, and survival rates were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). TNF, IL-10 and IL-6 levels were increased at diagnosis compared to D19 and D49. IL-10 levels<4.57pg/mL at diagnosis were associated with increased survival rate, in presence of positive correlation between IL-2 and IL-17 levels. Increased survival rate was also associated with IFN-gamma levels<1.17pg/mL at D49, with a positive correlation observed between IL-4 and IL-2 as well IL-4 and IL-17 levels. In contrast, worse survival rate was associated with IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 levels imbalance. In addition, increased sHLA-G levels at diagnosis were associated with increased leukocyte count, a well-known factor for poor prognosis. In conclusion, cytokines and sHLA-G play an essential role in marrow T-ALL microenvironment during chemotherapy, especially the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 which can be used as biomarker of disease outcome, being also a potential target for novel T-ALL treatments.","['Almeida, Renata Dos Santos', 'Ramos, Alessandra Maria de Luna', 'Luna, Carlos Feitosa', 'Pedrosa, Francisco', 'Donadi, Eduardo Antonio', 'Lucena-Silva, Norma']","['Almeida RDS', 'Ramos AML', 'Luna CF', 'Pedrosa F', 'Donadi EA', 'Lucena-Silva N']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunology, Aggeu Magalhaes Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncology Service, IMIP Hospital, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Collective Health, Aggeu Magalhaes Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncology Service, IMIP Hospital, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunology, Aggeu Magalhaes Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Recife, PE, Brazil; Pediatric Oncology Service, IMIP Hospital, Recife, PE, Brazil.

Few studies have focused specifically on benzene. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether parental occupational exposure to benzene is associated with an increased cancer risk in a census-based cohort of children. METHODS: From a census-based cohort study in Switzerland, we included children aged <16years at national censuses (1990, 2000). We retrieved parental occupations reported at census and assessed exposure to benzene using a job exposure matrix. We identified incident cancer cases through record linkage with the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We fitted Cox proportional-hazards models to assess associations between exposures and the following outcomes: any cancer, leukaemia, acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumours, and glioma. We adjusted models for a range of socio-economic, perinatal and environmental factors. RESULTS: Analyses of maternal (paternal) exposure were based on 9.0 (13.2)millionperson years at risk and included 1004 (1520) cases of cancer, of which 285 (438) had leukaemia, 186 (281) lymphoma, 227 (339) a CNS tumour. Maternal exposure was associated with an increased risk of childhood leukaemia (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.12-2.67) and ALL (1.88, 1.16-3.04). We found little evidence of an association for other outcomes or for paternal exposure. Adjusting for potential confounders did not materially affect the results. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cohort study suggests an increased risk of leukaemia among children whose mothers were exposed to benzene at work.","['Spycher, Ben Daniel', 'Lupatsch, Judith Eva', 'Huss, Anke', 'Rischewski, Johannes', 'Schindera, Christina', 'Spoerri, Adrian', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Kuehni, Claudia Elisabeth']","['Spycher BD', 'Lupatsch JE', 'Huss A', 'Rischewski J', 'Schindera C', 'Spoerri A', 'Vermeulen R', 'Kuehni CE']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

Conventional PCR monitoring of BCR-ABL is an important indicator to determine therapeutic intervention for preventing disease progression. However, PCR cannot separately quantify amounts of BCR-ABL and its mutants, including alternatively spliced BCR-ABL with an insertion of 35 intronic nucleotides (BCR-ABL(I)(ns35bp) ) between ABL exons 8 and 9, which introduces the premature termination and loss of kinase activity. To assess the clinical impact of BCR-ABL mutants, we performed deep sequencing analysis of BCR-ABL transcripts of 409 samples from 37 patients with suboptimal response to frontline imatinib who were switched to nilotinib. At baseline, TKI-resistant mutations were documented in 3 patients, whereas BCR-ABL(I)(ns35bp) was detected in all patients. After switching to nilotinib, both BCR-ABL and BCR-ABL(I)(ns35bp) became undetectable in 3 patients who attained complete molecular response (CMR), whereas in the remaining all 34 patients, BCR-ABL(I)(ns35bp) was persistently detected, and minimal residual disease (MRD) fluctuated at low but detectable levels. PCR monitoring underestimated molecular response in 5 patients whose BCR-ABL(I)(ns35bp) was persisted, although BCR-ABL(I)(ns35bp) does not definitively mark TKI resistance. Therefore, quantification of BCR-ABL(I)(ns35bp) is useful for evaluating ""functional"" MRD and determining the effectiveness of TKI with accuracy.","['Yuda, Junichiro', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Odawara, Jun', 'Ohkawa, Yasuyuki', 'Semba, Yuichiro', 'Hayashi, Masayasu', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Yuda J', 'Miyamoto T', 'Odawara J', 'Ohkawa Y', 'Semba Y', 'Hayashi M', 'Miyamura K', 'Tanimoto M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Taniwaki M', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Respiratory Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Science, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Research and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170921,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Exons/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Introns/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR- ABL I ns35bp', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'deep sequencing', 'minimal residual disease', 'splicing variant']",2017/08/13 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13353 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2017 Nov;108(11):2204-2212. doi: 10.1111/cas.13353.

Rapid clearance of the enzyme from blood stream and its L-glutaminase-dependent neurotoxicity has led to searching for new L-asparaginases with more desirable properties. In the present study, L-asparaginase coding gene of Halomonas elongata was isolated, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The purified protein was found to have a molecular mass of 39.5 kDa and 1000-folds more activity towards L-asparagine than L-glutamine. Enzyme-specific activity towards L-asparagine was determined to be 1510 U/mg, which is among the highest reported values for microbial L-asparaginases. K m , Vmax, and k cat values were 5.6 mM, 2.2 mumol/min, and 1.96 x 10(3) 1/S, respectively. Optimum temperature was found to be 37 degrees C while the enzyme showed maximum activity at a wide pH range (from 6 to 9). Enzyme half-life in the presence of human serum at 37 degrees C was 90 min which is three times higher when compared with reported values for E. coli L-asparaginase.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (eIF3D) has recently been shown to regulate the growth of several types of human cancer cells. However, the function of eIF3D in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression of eIF3D in three AML cell lines and a lymphoblast cell line, and found that eIF3D was expressed in all four leukemia cell lines. To explore the role of eIF3D in AML cell proliferation, lentivirus-mediated RNA interference was applied to knock down the expression of eIF3D in U937 cells. The expression of eIF3D was significantly downregulated in U937 cells after eIF3D knockdown, as confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Knockdown of eIF3D significantly inhibited proliferation of U937 cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that eIF3D silencing induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, ultimately leading to apoptosis. Our results indicate that eIF3D plays a key role in the proliferation of AML cells, and suggest that eIF3D silencing might be a potential therapeutic strategy for leukemia.","['Liu, Guo-Zhen', 'Liu, Ji-Zhu', 'Li, Xiao-Qing', 'Zhang, Li', 'Li, Shuang-Jing', 'Xiao, Tai-Wu', 'Wang, Jing-Xia', 'Li, Guang-Yao', 'Liu, Yusen']","['Liu GZ', 'Liu JZ', 'Li XQ', 'Zhang L', 'Li SJ', 'Xiao TW', 'Wang JX', 'Li GY', 'Liu Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, People's Republic of China. lcrmyy@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, People's Republic of China. lcrmyy@163.com."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Center for Perinatal Research, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, 575 Children's Cross Road, Columbus, OH, 43215, USA. yusen.liu@nationwidechildrens.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170812,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (EIF3D protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell proliferation', 'Growth arrest', 'RNA interference', 'Translational control', 'eIF3D']",2017/08/13 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/08/13 06:00'],"['2017/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-017-3127-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-017-3127-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2018 Jan;438(1-2):191-198. doi: 10.1007/s11010-017-3127-5.

In this study, we applied RNA sequencing to investigate the full spectrum of miRNA expression in primary T-ALL patient samples, T-ALL leukemia cell lines and healthy donor thymocytes. Notably, this analysis revealed that genetic subtypes of human T-ALL also display unique miRNA expression signatures, which are largely conserved in human T-ALL cell lines with corresponding genetic background. Furthermore, small RNA-sequencing also unraveled the variety of isoforms that are expressed for each miRNA in T-ALL and showed that a significant number of miRNAs are actually represented by an alternative isomiR. Finally, comparison of CD34(+) and CD4(+)CD8(+) healthy donor thymocytes and T-ALL miRNA profiles allowed identifying several novel miRNAs with putative oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions in T-ALL. Altogether, this study provides a comprehensive overview of miRNA expression in normal and malignant T-cells and sets the stage for functional evaluation of novel miRNAs in T-ALL disease biology.","['Wallaert, Annelynn', 'Van Loocke, Wouter', 'Hernandez, Lucie', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['Wallaert A', 'Van Loocke W', 'Hernandez L', 'Taghon T', 'Speleman F', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'University Paris Diderot and Hospital Saint-Louis, U944 INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. pieter.vanvlierberghe@ugent.be.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium. pieter.vanvlierberghe@ugent.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170811,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",,,2017/08/13 06:00,2019/03/02 06:00,['2017/08/13 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-08148-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-08148-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Aug 11;7(1):7901. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-08148-x.,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5275-9591', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9063-7205']",PMC5554241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recurrent genetic alterations cooperating with BRAFV600E or MAP2K1 mutations in HCL, as well as those in MAP2K1 wild-type vHCL, are not well defined. We therefore performed deep targeted mutational and copy number analysis of cHCL (n = 53) and vHCL (n = 8). The most common genetic alteration in cHCL apart from BRAFV600E was heterozygous loss of chromosome 7q, the minimally deleted region of which targeted wild-type BRAF, subdividing cHCL into those hemizygous versus heterozygous for the BRAFV600E mutation. In addition to CDKN1B mutations in cHCL, recurrent inactivating mutations in KMT2C (MLL3) were identified in 15% and 25% of cHCLs and vHCLs, respectively. Moreover, 13% of vHCLs harbored predicted activating mutations in CCND3 A change-of-function mutation in the splicing factor U2AF1 was also present in 13% of vHCLs. Genomic analysis of de novo vemurafenib-resistant cHCL identified a novel gain-of-function mutation in IRS1 and losses of NF1 and NF2, each of which contributed to resistance. These data provide further insight into the genetic bases of cHCL and vHCL and mechanisms of RAF inhibitor resistance encountered clinically.","['Durham, Benjamin H', 'Getta, Bartlomiej', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Taylor, Justin', 'Won, Helen', 'Bogenberger, James M', 'Scott, Sasinya', 'Kim, Eunhee', 'Chung, Young Rock', 'Chung, Stephen S', 'Hullein, Jennifer', 'Walther, Tatjana', 'Wang, Lu', 'Lu, Sydney X', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Tibes, Raoul', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Berger, Michael F', 'Park, Jae H', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Durham BH', 'Getta B', 'Dietrich S', 'Taylor J', 'Won H', 'Bogenberger JM', 'Scott S', 'Kim E', 'Chung YR', 'Chung SS', 'Hullein J', 'Walther T', 'Wang L', 'Lu SX', 'Oakes CC', 'Tibes R', 'Haferlach T', 'Taylor BS', 'Tallman MS', 'Berger MF', 'Park JH', 'Zenz T', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['Department of Pathology and.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Hematology and Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic/Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Scottsdale, AZ.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Hematology and Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Hematology and Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic/Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Scottsdale, AZ.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany; and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Hematology and Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170811,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '207SMY3FQT (Vemurafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cyclin D3/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Splicing Factor U2AF/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vemurafenib']",,,2017/08/13 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/08/13 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32812-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-01-765107 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Oct 5;130(14):1644-1648. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-01-765107.

Little is known about the reintegration into daily life of childhood cancer survivors and their families. The aim of this prospective observational study is to further the understanding of the role of rehabilitation measures in the reintegration process of childhood leukaemia or brain tumour survivors and their family members after the end of cancer treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective observational study consists of three study arms: a quantitative study in cooperation with three German paediatric oncological study registries (study arm 1), a quantitative study in cooperation with a rehabilitation clinic that offers a family-oriented paediatric oncological rehabilitation programme (study arm 2) and a qualitative study at 12-month follow-up including families from the study arms 1 and 2 (study arm 3). In study arm 1, children, parents and siblings are surveyed after treatment (baseline), 4-6 months after baseline measurement and at 12-month follow-up. In study arm 2, data are collected at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation measure and at 12-month follow-up. Families are assessed with standardised questionnaires on quality of life, emotional and behavioural symptoms, depression, anxiety, fear of progression, coping and family functioning. Furthermore, self-developed items on rehabilitation aims and reintegration into daily life are used. Where applicable, users and non-users of rehabilitation measures will be compared regarding the outcome parameters. Longitudinal data will be analysed by means of multivariate analysis strategies. Reference values will be used for comparisons if applicable. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the medical ethics committee of the Medical Chamber of Hamburg. Data will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences.","['Peikert, Mona Leandra', 'Inhestern, Laura', 'Bergelt, Corinna']","['Peikert ML', 'Inhestern L', 'Bergelt C']","['Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170811,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Anxiety', 'Brain Neoplasms/psychology/*rehabilitation', '*Cancer Survivors/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Program Evaluation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'School Health Services', 'Siblings/psychology', 'Social Adjustment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*brain tumour', '*childhood cancer', '*family-oriented rehabilitation', '*leukaemia', '*parents', '*siblings', '*survivor']",2017/08/13 06:00,2018/02/03 06:00,['2017/08/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2016-014505 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014505 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2017 Aug 11;7(8):e014505. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014505.,,"['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2017.

We present a case of MS developing in a patient with 5q- myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and review the relevant literature. METHODS: A 77-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of MDS associated with del(5q) presented with symptoms and signs attributable to a mass involving the T8 vertebra. Biopsy of the spinal mass was performed and the specimen was analyzed using routine hematoxylin-eosin stain, immunohistochemical methods, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: Microscopic examination revealed an infiltrate of intermediate-large cells with basophilic cytoplasm and nuclei containing occasional prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for CD4, CD43, CD45, CD68, and CD117, and negative for B- and T-cell antigens supporting the diagnosis of MS.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML. Heterocyclic compounds, such as indole, are considered as attractive candidates for cancer therapy, due to their abundance in nature and known biological activity. Sal-like protein (SALL4) is a zinc finger transcription factor involving in the multi-potency of stem cells, in the NB4 cell line. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of basal indole and its new derivative, 2-(1-((2, 4-Aril)imino)-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phenyl-1H Indole-3- carbaldehyde (TFPHC), on the expression of SALL4. Methods: Cells were cultured and treated with different concentrations (75, 150, and 300 microg/mL) of the new indole derivative and DMSO, as a vehicle control, for 24 and 48 hours. Cell proliferation was evaluated by using Trypan blue exclusion and MTT assays. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flowcytometry analysis using the Annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit; mRNA expression of SALL4 was studied using absolute quantitative RT-PCR. Data were analyzed by student's t-test. P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Our findings demonstrated the effects of new indole derivatives on SALL4 mRNA expression. Expression of SALL4 mRNA was significantly decreased at 75, 150, and 300 microg/mL concentrations. Conclusion: SALL4 plays a role in the survival of APL cells. SALL4 expression could be suppressed by the novel indole derivative. Additionally, SALL4 gene suppression can serve as a target in APL therapy.","['Sheikhrezaei, Zahra', 'Heydari, Parisa', 'Farsinezhad, Alireza', 'Fatemi, Ahmad', 'Khanamani Falahati-Pour, Soudeh', 'Darakhshan, Shokoofeh', 'Noroozi Karimabad, Mojgan', 'Darekordi, Ali', 'Khorramdelazad, Hossein', 'Hassanshahi, Gholamhossein']","['Sheikhrezaei Z', 'Heydari P', 'Farsinezhad A', 'Fatemi A', 'Khanamani Falahati-Pour S', 'Darakhshan S', 'Noroozi Karimabad M', 'Darekordi A', 'Khorramdelazad H', 'Hassanshahi G']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medical Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medical Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medical Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medical Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Pistachio Safety Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Vali-E-Asr University of Rafsanjan, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170812,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*SALL4 protein', '*Indoles', '*Leukemia', '*Acute promyelocytic']",2017/08/13 06:00,2017/08/13 06:01,['2017/08/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/13 06:01 [medline]', '2017/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.22034/ibj.22.2.99 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2018 Mar;22(2):99-106. doi: 10.22034/ibj.22.2.99.

However, relatively few population-level data are available for rare haematologic malignancies. METHODS: Data were extracted from 12 cancer registries in Germany and the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database in the United States (US). Cases of haematologic malignancies with an incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 were selected for analysis. Period analysis was used to determine 5-year relative survival (RS) for the years 2003-2012, and modelled period analysis was used to determine changes in survival between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012. RESULTS: Seven individual haematologic malignancies which met criteria were identified. Overall 5-year age-adjusted RS was 62.4% in Germany and 57.0% in the US in 2003-2012, with a good deal of variability by individual haematologic malignancy, ranging from less than 30% for chronic monomyeloid leukaemia to greater than 85% for hairy cell leukaemia and mycosis fungoides. Five-year RS increased significantly between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012 for patients with mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and hairy cell leukaemia in Germany and for patients with mantle cell lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell kinase+ anaplastic lymphoma in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Survival for rare haematologic malignancies varied considerably by cancer entity. Overall 5-year RS was slightly higher in Germany compared to the US. Survival estimates increased for a minority of haematologic malignancies between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012. Further research into the best treatment options for rare malignancies is needed to further improve survival.","['Pulte, Dianne', 'Weberpals, Janick', 'Jansen, Lina', 'Luttmann, Sabine', 'Holleczek, Bernd', 'Nennecke, Alice', 'Ressing, Meike', 'Katalinic, Alexander', 'Brenner, Hermann']","['Pulte D', 'Weberpals J', 'Jansen L', 'Luttmann S', 'Holleczek B', 'Nennecke A', 'Ressing M', 'Katalinic A', 'Brenner H']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.

In this study, we tested if human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) have protective effects on leukemic cells undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Persistent disease was used as marker to identify cases with therapy-resistant leukemic cells in 95 patients with AML. Immunophenotyping, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays were assessed by flow cytometry. AML coculture studies were performed with hMSC of healthy donors. RESULTS: Samples from patients with persistent disease had increased fractions of CD34(+) CD38(-) and quiescent leukemic cells. Comparison of sample series collected at time points of diagnosis and blast persistence showed a relative therapy resistance of quiescent leukemic cells. Consistent with these observations, relapsed disease always displayed higher proportions of quiescent cells compared to samples of first diagnosis suggesting that quiescence is an important therapy escape mechanism of resistant cells. Co-culture studies demonstrated that hMSC protect leukemic cells from the effect of AraC treatment by enriching for quiescent cells, mimicking the effects observed in patients. This effect was even detectable when no direct stromal contact was established. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that hMSC contribute to quiescence and therapy resistance of persistent AML cells.","['Wang, Wenwen', 'Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Manta, Linda', 'He, Haiju', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Lutz, Christoph']","['Wang W', 'Bochtler T', 'Wuchter P', 'Manta L', 'He H', 'Eckstein V', 'Ho AD', 'Lutz C']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine V, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170913,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell cycle', 'mesenchymal stromal cells', 'refractory disease']",2017/08/12 06:00,2018/06/02 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12934 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Nov;99(5):392-398. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12934.

The most devastating consequence of EtOH exposure is the neurotoxicity associated with the depletion of neurons. Regulation of splice variants in the brain can modulate protein functions, which may ultimately affect behaviors associated with alcohol dependence and EtOH-mediated neurotoxicity. As alcohol consumption is associated with neurotoxicity, it is possible that altered splicing of survival and pro-survival factors during the development of alcoholism may contribute to the neurotoxicity. METHODS: Primary human neurons and a neuroblastoma cell line were exposed to different concentrations of EtOH for various time periods. Cell viability and neuronal marker expression were analyzed by MTT assay and immunoblotting, respectively. Effect of EtOH exposure on splicing regulatory protein expression and alternative splicing of candidate genes was analyzed by a biochemical approach. Transcriptional activity of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) gene was determined by reporter gene analysis. RESULTS: Our results suggest that EtOH exposure to neuronal cells at 25 mM and higher concentrations are detrimental. In addition, EtOH exposure caused a dramatic reduction in SRSF1 expression levels. Furthermore, EtOH exposure led to pre-mRNA missplicing of Mcl-1, a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family, by down-regulating the expression levels of SRSF1. Moreover, ectopic expression of both SRSF1 and Mcl-1L isoform was able to recover EtOH-mediated neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that EtOH exposure can lead to pre-mRNA missplicing of Mcl-1 in neuronal cells. Our results indicate that EtOH exposure of neurons leads to a decrease in the ratio of Mcl-1L/Mcl-1S by favoring pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S splicing over anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L isoform suggesting that Mcl-1S may play a crucial role in neurotoxicity associated with alcohol consumption.","['Sariyer, Rahsan', 'De-Simone, Francesca I', 'Donadoni, Martina', 'Hoek, Jan B', 'Chang, Sulie L', 'Sariyer, Ilker Kudret']","['Sariyer R', 'De-Simone FI', 'Donadoni M', 'Hoek JB', 'Chang SL', 'Sariyer IK']","['Department of Neuroscience, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Institute of NeuroImmune Pharmacology and Department of Biological Sciences, Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170901,England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethanol/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'RNA Precursors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Alcoholism', 'Alternative Pre-mRNA Splicing', 'Mcl-1', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factor 1']",2017/08/12 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/acer.13474 [doi]'],ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2017 Oct;41(10):1715-1724. doi: 10.1111/acer.13474.

Recent studies suggest that addition of an MCL-1 inhibitor to such anticancer drug treatments could be an attractive therapeutic strategy. Thus, it is of great interest to understand whether combinations of conventional anticancer drugs with an MCL-1 inhibitor will be tolerable and efficacious. In order to mimic the combination of MCL-1 inhibition with other cancer therapeutics, we treated Mcl-1(+/-) heterozygous mice, which have a ~50% reduction in MCL-1 protein in their cells, with a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs. Careful monitoring of treated mice revealed that a wide range of chemotherapeutic drugs had no significant effect on the general well-being of Mcl-1(+/-) mice with no overt damage to a broad range of tissues, including the haematopoietic compartment, heart, liver and kidney. These results indicate that MCL-1 inhibition may represent a tolerable strategy in cancer therapy, even when combined with select cytotoxic drugs.","['Brinkmann, Kerstin', 'Grabow, Stephanie', 'Hyland, Craig D', 'Teh, Charis E', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Herold, Marco J', 'Strasser, Andreas']","['Brinkmann K', 'Grabow S', 'Hyland CD', 'Teh CE', 'Alexander WS', 'Herold MJ', 'Strasser A']","['Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170811,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/08/12 06:00,2018/07/26 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2017125 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2017.125 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2017 Dec;24(12):2032-2043. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2017.125.

Both Mnt and Myc utilise Max as an obligate partner for DNA binding, and Myc/Max and Mnt/Max complexes compete for occupancy at E-box DNA sequences in promoter regions. We have previously shown in transgenic mouse models that the phenotype and kinetics of onset of haemopoietic tumours varies with the level of Myc expression. We reasoned that a decrease in the level of Mnt would increase the functional level of Myc and accelerate Myc-driven tumorigenesis. We tested the impact of reduced Mnt in three models of myc transgenic mice and in p53(+/-) mice. To our surprise, mnt heterozygosity actually slowed Myc-driven tumorigenesis in vavP-MYC10 and Emu-myc mice, suggesting that Mnt facilitates Myc-driven oncogenesis. To explore the underlying cause of the delay in tumour development, we enumerated Myc-driven cell populations in healthy young vavP-MYC10 and Emu-myc mice, expecting that the reduced rate of leukaemogenesis in mnt heterozygous mice would be reflected in a reduced number of preleukaemic cells, due to increased apoptosis or reduced proliferation or both. However, no differences were apparent. Furthermore, when mnt(+/+) and mnt(+/-) pre-B cells from healthy young Emu-myc mice were compared in vitro, no differences were seen in their sensitivity to apoptosis or in cell size or cell cycling. Moreover, the frequencies of apoptotic, senescent and proliferating cells were comparable in vivo in mnt(+/-) and mnt(+/+) Emu-myc lymphomas. Thus, although mnt heterozygosity clearly slowed lymphomagenesis in vavP-MYC10 and Emu-myc mice, the change(s) in cellular properties responsible for this effect remain to be identified.","['Campbell, Kirsteen J', 'Vandenberg, Cassandra J', 'Anstee, Natasha S', 'Hurlin, Peter J', 'Cory, Suzanne']","['Campbell KJ', 'Vandenberg CJ', 'Anstee NS', 'Hurlin PJ', 'Cory S']","['Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia.', ""Shriner's Hospital for Children, Portland, OR, USA."", 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170811,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mnt protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/08/12 06:00,2018/07/26 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2017131 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2017.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2017 Dec;24(12):2117-2126. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2017.131.

Several potent inhibitors of FLT3 exist, and bind to the inactive form of the enzyme. Unfortunately, resistance due to mutations in the kinase domain of FLT3 limits the therapeutic effects of these inhibitors. As in many other cases, it is not straightforward to explain why certain mutations lead to drug resistance. Extensive fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of FLT3 were carried out with an inhibited form (FLT-quizartinib complex), a free (apo) form, and an active conformation. In all cases, both the wild type (wt) proteins and two resistant mutants (D835F and Y842H) were studied. Analysis of the simulations revealed that impairment of protein-drug interactions cannot explain the resistance mutations in question. Rather, it appears that the active state of the mutant forms is perturbed by the mutations. It is therefore likely that perturbation of deactivation of the protein (which is necessary for drug binding) is responsible for the reduced affinity of the drug to the mutants. Importantly, this study suggests that it is possible to explain the source of resistance by mutations in FLT3 by an analysis of unbiased MD simulations.","['Friedman, Ran']",['Friedman R'],"['Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, 39 182 Kalmar, Sweden.', 'Centre of Excellence ""Biomaterials Chemistry"", Linnaeus University, 39 182 Kalmar, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/drug effects/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['kinase inhibitors', 'leukemia', 'molecular dynamics', 'resistance mutations']",2017/08/12 06:00,2017/10/31 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/prot.25368 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteins. 2017 Nov;85(11):2143-2152. doi: 10.1002/prot.25368.

Even the white blood cells which are produced excessively are immature and abnormal. ALL is the most common hematological malignancy in children. Most commonly, patients present with lymphadenopathy, recurrent infections, bleeding, fatigue, and bone pains. Bone pains, often particularly involving long bones, occur in about 21-38% of cases and are due to overcrowding of bone marrow with malignant cells. Vast majority of children with ALL have thrombocytopenia and/or anemia with a normal or mildly elevated white blood cells count with the presence of lymphoblasts on peripheral smear. About 50% of children present with bleeding while about 75% of patients have platelet count 100,000/microL. Visceromegaly is not uncommon but osteolytic lesions and hypercalcemia are rather uncommon. We present a 22-year-old gentleman with generalized fatigue and bone pains without visceromegaly. There was severe hypercalcemia with normal parathyroid levels but multiple osteolytic lesions. Peripheral smear showed anemia without blasts, whereas a bone marrow biopsy revealed > 30% blasts with interspersed CD 10 positive cells.","['Mahmood, Khalid', 'Ubaid, Muhammad', 'Taliya Rizvi, Syeda']","['Mahmood K', 'Ubaid M', 'Taliya Rizvi S']","['Faculty of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Civil Hospital Karachi, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Civil Hospital Karachi, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20170717,United States,Case Rep Med,Case reports in medicine,101512910,,,,,,2017/08/12 06:00,2017/08/12 06:01,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/2347810 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Med. 2017;2017:2347810. doi: 10.1155/2017/2347810.

Similar to textbook knowledge the most important function of CD4+ T cells during an acute retrovirus infection seems to be their helper function for other immune cells. Whereas there was no direct anti-viral activity of CD4+ T cells during acute Friend Virus (FV) infection, they were absolutely required for the control of chronic infection. During chronic FV infection a population of activated FV-specific CD4+ T cells did not express cytotoxic molecules, but Fas Ligand that can induce Fas-induced apoptosis in target cells. Using an MHC II-restricted in vivo CTL assay we demonstrated that FV-specific CD4+ T cells indeed mediated cytotoxic effects against FV epitope peptide loaded targets. CD4 + CTL killing was also detected in FV-infected granzyme B knockout mice confirming that the exocytosis pathway was not involved. However, killing could be blocked by antibodies against FasL, which identified the Fas/FasL pathway as critical cytotoxic mechanism during chronic FV infection. Interestingly, targeting the co-stimulatory receptor CD137 with an agonistic antibody enhanced CD4+ T cell cytotoxicity. This immunotherapy may be an interesting new approach for the treatment of chronic viral infections.","['Malyshkina, Anna', 'Littwitz-Salomon, Elisabeth', 'Sutter, Kathrin', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Windmann, Sonja', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Paschen, Annette', 'Streeck, Hendrik', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Malyshkina A', 'Littwitz-Salomon E', 'Sutter K', 'Zelinskyy G', 'Windmann S', 'Schimmer S', 'Paschen A', 'Streeck H', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.

In particular, NOD/SCID/IL2rg(-/-) mice can support the growth of various types of human cancer cells. However, the hairs of these mice interfere with the observation and imaging of engrafted tissues. Therefore, novel hairless strains exhibiting comparable immunodeficiency would be beneficial. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used for efficient multiplexed genome editing. In the present study, we generated a novel strain of nude NOD/SCID/IL2rg(-/-) (NSIN) mice by knocking out Foxn1 from NOD/SCID/IL2rg(-/-) (NSI) mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The NSIN mice were deficient in B, T, and NK cells and not only showed impaired T cell reconstitution and thymus regeneration after allogeneic bone marrow nucleated cell transplantation but also exhibited improved capacity to graft both leukemic and solid tumor cells compared with NSI, NOG, and NDG mice. Moreover, the NSIN mice facilitated the monitoring and in vivo imaging of both leukemia and solid tumors. Therefore, our NSIN mice provide a new platform for xenograft mouse models in basic and translational research.","['Wei, Xinru', 'Lai, Yunxin', 'Li, Baiheng', 'Qin, Le', 'Xu, Youdi', 'Lin, Simiao', 'Wang, Suna', 'Wu, Qiting', 'Liang, Qiubin', 'Huang, Guohua', 'Deng, Qiuhua', 'Liu, Pentao', 'Wu, Donghai', 'Lai, Liangxue', 'Yao, Yao', 'Li, Peng']","['Wei X', 'Lai Y', 'Li B', 'Qin L', 'Xu Y', 'Lin S', 'Wang S', 'Wu Q', 'Liang Q', 'Huang G', 'Deng Q', 'Liu P', 'Wu D', 'Lai L', 'Yao Y', 'Li P']","['School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Shenzhen InVivo Biomedicine Co.

Gastrointestinal upset, headache, and dizziness are common adverse effects, and prolongation of the rate-corrected electrocardiographic QT interval and malignant arrhythmias have been reported. There are rare reports of bradycardia and hypothermia but not in the same patient. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old boy given intravenous azithromycin as part of treatment for febrile neutropenia complicating leukemia chemotherapy developed hypothermia (rectal temperature 35.2 degrees C) and bradycardia (65 beats/minute) after the second dose, which resolved over several days post-treatment, consistent with persistence of high tissue azithromycin concentrations relative to those in plasma. A sigmoid Emax pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model suggested a maximal azithromycin-associated reduction in heart rate of 23 beats/minute. Monitoring for these potential adverse effects should facilitate appropriate supportive care in similar cases. CONCLUSIONS Recommended azithromycin doses can cause at least moderate bradycardia and hypothermia in vulnerable pediatric patients, adverse effects that should prompt appropriate monitoring and which may take many days to resolve.","['Benn, Kerri', 'Salman, Sam', 'Page-Sharp, Madhu', 'Davis, Timothy M E', 'Buttery, Jim P']","['Benn K', 'Salman S', 'Page-Sharp M', 'Davis TME', 'Buttery JP']","[""Department of Infection and Immunity, Monash Children's Hospital, Clayton, Victoria, Australia."", 'School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy, Curtin University of Technology, Bentley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', ""Department of Infection and Immunity, Monash Children's Hospital, Clayton, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', ""Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community (SAEFVIC), Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170811,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '83905-01-5 (Azithromycin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Azithromycin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bradycardia/*chemically induced', 'Child, Preschool', 'Febrile Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hypothermia/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male']",,,2017/08/12 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['905400 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.905400 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2017 Aug 11;18:883-886. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.905400.,,,,PMC5562267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No consensus regarding optimal treatment modalities is currently available. Targeting the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway is considered a promising approach since blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm has been reported to exhibit constitutive activation of this pathway. Moreover, nuclear factor-kappa B inhibition in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cell lines, achieved using either an experimental specific inhibitor JSH23 or the clinical drug bortezomib, interferes in vitro with leukemic cell proliferation and survival. Here we extended these data by showing that primary blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cells from seven patients were sensitive to bortezomib-induced cell death. We confirmed that bortezomib efficiently inhibits the phosphorylation of the RelA nuclear factor-kappa B subunit in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cell lines and primary cells from patients in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model. We then demonstrated that bortezomib can be associated with other drugs used in different chemotherapy regimens to improve its impact on leukemic cell death. Indeed, when primary blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cells from a patient were grafted into mice, bortezomib treatment significantly increased the animals' survival, and was associated with a significant decrease of circulating leukemic cells and RelA nuclear factor-kappa B subunit expression. Overall, our results provide a rationale for the use of bortezomib in combination with other chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Based on our data, a prospective clinical trial combining proteasome inhibitor with classical drugs could be envisaged.","['Philippe, Laure', 'Ceroi, Adam', 'Bole-Richard, Elodie', 'Jenvrin, Alizee', 'Biichle, Sabeha', 'Perrin, Sophie', 'Limat, Samuel', 'Bonnefoy, Francis', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Saas, Philippe', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Angelot-Delettre, Fanny']","['Philippe L', 'Ceroi A', 'Bole-Richard E', 'Jenvrin A', 'Biichle S', 'Perrin S', 'Limat S', 'Bonnefoy F', 'Deconinck E', 'Saas P', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Angelot-Delettre F']","['CHRU Besancon, Hematology, Besancon, France.', 'Univ.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the current study, the records of 14 patients were examined retrospectively. Along with the minimum and maximum doses for brain and CP, D95% (minimal dose received by the 95% volume of a structure) and V95% (percent volume of target receiving 95% of prescribed dose) could be obtained from the dose-volume histogram. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann Whitney test in SPSS-15. RESULTS: ALL/AML ratio was 9/5. CNS relapse was observed only in 2 patients. The minimum dose was 1249 (1100-1782) cGy, 1036 (547-1651) cGy, 856 (308-1460) cGy and 1234 (922-1727) cGy for brain parenchyma, right ON, left ON and CP, respectively. The value of D95%/D was 1.01 (1-1.06) and 0.99 (0.92- 1.06) for brain parenchyma and CP, respectively. V95% was 99.8 % (98.6%-100%) and 98.1% (80.5%-100%) for brain parenchyma and CP, respectively. The analyses revealed that none of the target tissue dose-volume parameters for PCI affected CNS relapse (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: In our study; it was found that the dosevolume parameters of the brain, CP and ONs did not have any effect on CNS relapse. Along with the other clinical factors, the scarce number of patients included in the study might have concealed the effects of parameters related to RT.","['Guzeloz, Zeliha', 'Demiral, Ayse Nur', 'Eren, Fatma', 'Adigul, Mehmet', 'Capar, Ahmet Ergin', 'Cakmakci, Handan', 'Yilmaz, Sebnem', 'Tufekci, Ozlem', 'Oren, Hale', 'Cetingoz, Riza']","['Guzeloz Z', 'Demiral AN', 'Eren F', 'Adigul M', 'Capar AE', 'Cakmakci H', 'Yilmaz S', 'Tufekci O', 'Oren H', 'Cetingoz R']","['Dept of Radiation Oncology, SBU Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Radiation Oncology, Dokuz Eylul Univ Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Physical Med and Rehab, Bezmi Alem Univ Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Dept of Radiation Oncology, Dokuz Eylul Univ Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Radiology, SBU Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Radiology, Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Pediatric Hematology, Dokuz Eylul Univ Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Pediatric Hematology, Dokuz Eylul Univ Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Pediatric Hematology, Dokuz Eylul Univ Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dept of Radiation Oncology, Dokuz Eylul Univ Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Kuwait,Gulf J Oncolog,The Gulf journal of oncology,101500911,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2017/08/12 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gulf J Oncolog. 2017 May;1(24):24-29.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was carried out to determine the frequency and type of cytogenetic aberrations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia in adults at a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the Hematology Department, Liaquat National Hospital from November 2014 to April 2016.A total of 51cases were diagnosed with AML during the study period. Cytogenetic analysis was carried out by banding technique on bone marrow aspirate samples. RESULTS: The mean age of the study subject was 42.03+/-17.70 years. Frequency of karyotyping abnormalities was observed in 47% of cases, in which most frequently occurring cytogenetic abnormalities were those of good cytogenetics including t(15;17) and t(8;21), seen in 23.5% and 9.8% of cases respectively. Intermediate risk cytogenetics including Del 9q was seen in 1.96% of cases. However, poor risk cytogenetics including complex cytogenetics, t(11;q23) and del (13) were seen in 7.8%, 1.96% and 1.96% of cases respectively. Normal cytogenetics was seen in 27 (52.9%) patients. CONCLUSION: Karyotyping is one of the most important diagnostic and prognostic tools and a maximum benefit could be attained through cytogenetic analysis. Cytogenetic aberrations in our series are more or less similar as reported at national level with preponderance of good risk cytogenetics in our setting.","['Abbas, Syeda Alia', 'Sultan, Sadian', 'Ashar, Sana', 'Irfan, Syed Muhamad Irfan']","['Abbas SA', 'Sultan S', 'Ashar S', 'Irfan SMI']","['Hematology Department, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Hematology Department, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Hematology Department, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Hematology Department, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Kuwait,Gulf J Oncolog,The Gulf journal of oncology,101500911,,IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan']",,,2017/08/12 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2017/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gulf J Oncolog. 2017 May;1(24):6-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the effect of fisetin on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic responses. In this study, the effect of fisetin on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell-mediated allergic reactions was investigated. Fisetin inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release and decreased the level of interleukin-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA in IgE/antigen (IgE/Ag)-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. To elucidate the antiallergic mechanism, we examined the levels of signaling molecules responsible for degranulation and release of inflammatory cytokines. Fisetin decreased the levels of activated spleen tyrosine kinase, Gab2 proteins, linker of activated T cells, extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 in the IgE/Ag-stimulated RBL2H3 cells, and NFkappaB and STAT3 proteins activated in the ear tissue of mice with passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA). In addition, fisetin significantly lowered of FcvarepsilonRI alpha-subunit mRNA expression. Consistent with the cellular data, fisetin markedly suppressed RBL-2H3 cell-dependent PCA in IgE/Ag-sensitized mice. These results suggest that fisetin may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic diseases.","['Jo, Woo-Ri', 'Park, Hye-Jin']","['Jo WR', 'Park HJ']","['Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, College of BioNano Technology, Gachon University, 1342 Seongnam-daero, Sujeong gu Seongnam-si Gyeonggi-do, 461-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, College of BioNano Technology, Gachon University, 1342 Seongnam-daero, Sujeong gu Seongnam-si Gyeonggi-do, 461-701, Republic of Korea.

HCT is associated with neurocognitive impairment, which may be exacerbated in older adults due to normal neurocognitive decline associated with aging. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether increasing age of allogeneic HCT recipients is associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes over time relative to a matched sample of individuals without cancer. Patients (n = 140; 42% female; M age, 51 years; range, 20 to 76 years; 31% with acute myelogenous leukemia) completed neurocognitive assessments before transplantation and 3 months and 1 year after transplantation. Controls (n = 75; 56% female; M age, 53 years; range, 21 to 74 years) completed assessments at comparable time intervals. Linear mixed models revealed that regardless of age, patients demonstrated worse performance than controls before transplantation in verbal memory, visual memory, and total neuropsychological performance, and over time in executive functioning. In addition, older age was associated with worse performance in verbal memory (P = .02) and verbal fluency (P = .05) over time in patients compared with controls. Specifically, older (65+ years) patients had worse verbal memory and verbal fluency than older and younger (<65 years) controls post-transplantation (Cohen's d = .22 to .39). These data indicate that age may be a risk factor for worse neurocognitive outcomes after allogeneic HCT. If replicated, our results suggest that older candidates for allogeneic HCT should be counseled regarding the risk of cognitive problems after transplantation.","['Hoogland, Aasha I', 'Nelson, Ashley M', 'Small, Brent J', 'Hyland, Kelly A', 'Gonzalez, Brian D', 'Booth-Jones, Margaret', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Jacobsen, Paul B', 'Jim, Heather S L']","['Hoogland AI', 'Nelson AM', 'Small BJ', 'Hyland KA', 'Gonzalez BD', 'Booth-Jones M', 'Anasetti C', 'Jacobsen PB', 'Jim HSL']","['Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida; Department of Oncologic Sciences, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Psychology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.', 'School of Aging Studies, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Psychology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Healthcare Delivery Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.

Maximizing the benefit of transplantation for disease control while minimizing the risk for associated complications remains the field's leading challenge. This challenge has prompted the development of multiple prognostic scoring systems over the last 2 decades. Prognostic scores can be used for informed decision making, better patient counseling, design of interventional trials, and analysis of prospective and retrospective data. They are also helpful in treatment allocation and personalization according to predicted risk. A better understanding of the molecular and cytogenetic features of the disease, along with the advent of novel therapies, has increased the need for reliable prognostication of which patients will benefit most from transplantation. Here we review the clinical role of the prognostic systems currently in clinical use, examining both their strengths and their limitations.","['Potdar, Rashmika', 'Varadi, Gabor', 'Fein, Joshua', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Shouval, Roni']","['Potdar R', 'Varadi G', 'Fein J', 'Labopin M', 'Nagler A', 'Shouval R']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France; Acute Leukemia Working Party, EBMT Paris Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel; Acute Leukemia Working Party, EBMT Paris Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel; Dr. Pinchas Bornstein Talpiot Medical Leadership Program, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.

We used the GRADE methodology to aid in moving from evidence to decision making and ultimately to generating final recommendations. Auto-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended in peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALCL-ALK)-negative, NK/T cell (disseminated), enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Auto-HCT in relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and ALCL-ALK-positive lymphomas. Auto-HCT is also recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, and ALCL-ALK-negative lymphomas if not performed as front-line therapy. Auto-HCT in refractory (primary or relapsed) disease is not recommended for any of the histological subtypes discussed. Allo-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended for NK/T cell (disseminated), adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL; acute and lymphoma type), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Allo-HCT for relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, ALCL-ALK-negative, ALCL-ALK-positive, NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), ATLL (acute, lymphoma type, smoldering/chronic), mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (advanced stage IIB-IVB or tumor stage/extracutaneous), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and hepatosplenic lymphoma. Allo-HCT in refractory (primary or relapsed refractory) disease is recommended for any aforementioned histological subtypes. Emerging novel therapies will likely be incorporated into the pretransplantation, peritransplantation, and post-transplantation algorithms (auto-HCT or allo-HCT) with the goals of optimizing efficacy and improving outcomes. We acknowledge that there are unique clinical scenarios not covered by these recommendations that may require individualized decisions.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Kumar, Ambuj', 'Ayala, Ernesto', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Reimer, Peter', 'Gisselbrecht, Christian', ""d'Amore, Francesco"", 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Foss, Francine', 'Advani, Ranjana', 'Fenske, Timothy S', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Sokol, Lubomir', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Tse, Eric', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Chavez, Julio C', 'Reddy, Nishitha M', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Nademanee, Auayporn', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Gopal, Ajay K', 'Fanale, Michelle A', 'Pro, Barbara', 'Moskowitz, Alison J', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Perales, Miguel Angel', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Savani, Bipin N']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Kumar A', 'Ayala E', 'Hamadani M', 'Reimer P', 'Gisselbrecht C', ""d'Amore F"", 'Jantunen E', 'Ishida T', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Foss F', 'Advani R', 'Fenske TS', 'Lazarus HM', 'Friedberg JW', 'Aljurf M', 'Sokol L', 'Tobinai K', 'Tse E', 'Burns LJ', 'Chavez JC', 'Reddy NM', 'Suzuki R', 'Ahmed S', 'Nademanee A', 'Mohty M', 'Gopal AK', 'Fanale MA', 'Pro B', 'Moskowitz AJ', 'Sureda A', 'Perales MA', 'Carpenter PA', 'Savani BN']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

One third of patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is associated with an extremely poor outcome and a short survival. Our objectives were to analyze the prognostic variables and scoring systems in the attempt to determine the influence of progression on the overall survival of MDS patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 831 MDS patients, including those from the Argentine Registry. RESULTS: Of the 831 MDS patients, 158 (19.0%) experienced transformation, with a median overall survival of 17.9 months from diagnosis and 3.5 months after progression. The survival of patients with adverse karyotypes or greater risk, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System-revised (IPSS-R) or World Health Organization-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) was not affected when stratified by patients with and without evolution to AML (P > .05). In contrast, the survival of lower risk patients was significantly reduced for those patients with progression to AML (P < .001) and those younger (P = .024) than those who died of non-AML-related causes. The intermediate-risk patients were heterogeneously distributed; however, an upgrade from a lower IPSS-R to a higher WPSS-hemoglobin risk category was associated with a worse outcome, not affected by progression (P = .420), with a median event-free survival of 16 months. CONCLUSION: The use of the IPSS-R and WPSS systems simultaneously might help in identifying those patients who require more aggressive treatment. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed to improve the identification of those lower risk patients whose survival is significantly reduced by progression to AML.","['Enrico, Alicia', 'Bestach, Yesica', 'Flores, Maria Gabriela', 'Arbelbide, Jorge', 'Serale, Camila', 'Novoa, Viviana', 'Crisp, Renee', 'Rivas, Maria Marta', 'Larripa, Irene', 'Belli, Carolina']","['Enrico A', 'Bestach Y', 'Flores MG', 'Arbelbide J', 'Serale C', 'Novoa V', 'Crisp R', 'Rivas MM', 'Larripa I', 'Belli C']","['Area de Hematologia, Hospital Italiano de La Plata, La Plata, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas/Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires City, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Agudos C Durand, Buenos Aires City, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires City, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas/Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires City, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Agudos C Durand, Buenos Aires City, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Nacional A Posadas, El Palomar, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Austral, Pilar Centro, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas/Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires City, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas/Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires City, Argentina.

Despite its acceptable short-term toxicity profile, long-term toxicities are less well established. This study investigated the long-term adverse effects of bendamustine and responses to subsequent treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts of 194 patients were retrospectively reviewed; 54% had received prior treatment (76% attained complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). RESULTS: Patients who did not achieve a CR or PR did not respond well to subsequent treatments. Malignancies following bendamustine were diagnosed in 11% (21) of patients (first line [7] and salvage [14]), including squamous (8) or basal cell (4) skin cancers; prostate cancer (3), renal cancer (3), bladder cancer (2), melanoma (2), lung cancer (1), and histiocytic sarcoma (1). There were no occurrences of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia reported. Infections occurred in 63% of patients; however, no deaths were attributable to bendamustine. CONCLUSION: Bendamustine is an effective therapy with limited long-term sequelae in patients with lymphoid malignancies.","['Penne, Mara', 'Sarraf Yazdy, Maryam', 'Nair, Kruti Sheth', 'Cheson, Bruce D']","['Penne M', 'Sarraf Yazdy M', 'Nair KS', 'Cheson BD']","['Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC.

In its more common, aggressive forms, ATL carries one of the poorest prognoses of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The disease has clinical subtypes (ie, acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering forms) defined by the presenting features, and therefore, the clinical course can vary. For the smoldering and lower-risk chronic forms, combinations involving antiviral therapies have shown some success. However, in many patients, the more indolent forms will evolve into the more aggressive subtypes. In the more aggressive acute, lymphoma, and higher-risk chronic forms, the literature supports initial treatment with combination chemotherapy followed by allogeneic transplantation as a potentially curative approach. Recently, mogamulizumab and lenalidomide have shown promise in the treatment of ATL. With better understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease, we hope that the therapeutic landscape will continue to expand.","['Mehta-Shah, Neha', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Horwitz, Steven M']","['Mehta-Shah N', 'Ratner L', 'Horwitz SM']","['Washington University, St Louis, MO; and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Washington University, St Louis, MO; and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Washington University, St Louis, MO; and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)', 'CHOP protocol', 'EPOCH protocol']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",,,2017/08/11 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JOP.2017.021907 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2017 Aug;13(8):487-492. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2017.021907.,"['K12 CA167540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6366298,,,"['J Oncol Pract. 2017 Aug;13(8):495-497.

Advances in diagnostics now permit the detection and quantification of MRD in AML by several techniques. The level of MRD after induction and consolidation therapy correlates with disease sensitivity to chemotherapy and has greater power to predict long-term survival than patient and disease characteristics that are available at diagnosis, including genetic information. A unique advantage of MRD is that it is an integrated measure of the impact and interaction of genetics, epigenetics, host immune milieu, bone marrow environment, and drug sensitivity on disease response to treatment. Here, we review the main techniques for MRD assessment in AML, including polymerase chain reaction, multiparameter flow cytometry, and next-generation sequencing, with a focus on method-specific and general limitations to the optimal employment of MRD techniques for the determination of AML prognosis. We also review the data that establish the prognostic and predictive value of MRD assessment in AML. Finally, we provide recommendations for the use of MRD in the care of patients with AML in clinical practice today, including whether it should influence treatment decisions.","['Luskin, Marlise R', 'Stone, Richard M']","['Luskin MR', 'Stone RM']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factors/genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,,2017/08/11 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JOP.2017.021675 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2017 Aug;13(8):471-480. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2017.021675.,,,,,,,"['J Oncol Pract. 2017 Aug;13(8):481-483.

Kinase inhibitors (KI) are major therapeutic innovations for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and myelofibrosis (MF) providing a relevant improvement of quality-adjusted survival in patients with high-risk or refractory disease. CML patients are being treated with first-generation KI imatinib since many years, achieving expected survivals longer than 10 years. Second- and third generations KIs, such as nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib and bosutinib, recently expanded the therapeutic yield for CML and treatment discontinuation in patients with persistent deep molecular response is being pursued. Areas covered: This review summarizes available evidence on economic analyses of KI treatments for CML, CLL and MF aimed at identifying the key determinants of KI cost-effectiveness. Expert commentary: On converse, specific KIs for CLL and MF patients have been marketed only in the last few years. Ibrutinib and idelalisib allowed to improve the outcomes of relapsed/refractory CLL and of patients with poor genetic features, while the first-in-class JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib allowed to improve symptoms of advanced MF patients and to prolong survival in responders. In the current situation of healthcare budget restrictions worldwide, the value for cost of the above KIs has been questioned.","['Marchetti, Monia']",['Marchetti M'],"['a Hematology Day Service, Oncology SOC, Hospital Cardinal Massaia , Asti , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170821,England,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,101132257,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/economics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/economics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy/economics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cost-effectiveness', 'chronic lymphoid leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'imatinib', 'myelofibrosis', 'nilotinib', 'ruxolitinib']",2017/08/11 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737167.2017.1366858 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res. 2017 Oct;17(5):469-480. doi: 10.1080/14737167.2017.1366858.

Our primary objective was to describe current access to specialty PC consultation and ACP for inpatients with high-risk leukemia. Secondary objectives were to describe components of ACP and PC practices. METHODS: We enrolled all patients with high-risk leukemia (acute leukemia >/=65 years or relapsed leukemia >18 years) admitted to the University of North Carolina Cancer Hospital from October 1, 2015, to August 1, 2016. Structured chart reviews provided data on demographics, disease characteristics, PC consultation, frequency and components of documented ACP, and quality measures for PC practices. RESULTS: Of 50 high-risk leukemia patients, 52% were 65 years of age or older with a new diagnosis of acute leukemia and 48% were under the age of 65 with relapsed leukemia. Most patients (64%) reported pain on admission. Twenty-two percent of patients died within 3 months of hospitalization. Sixteen percent of patients received PC consultation and 24% had complete ACP, with an identified surrogate decision-maker documented treatment preferences. CONCLUSIONS: In this descriptive study of inpatients with high-risk leukemia, we found that despite a poor prognosis and high symptom burden, the frequency of PC consultation and ACP documentation was low. Findings suggest missed opportunities to provide PC to a high-risk subset of hematologic malignancies, and may help to target future interventions.","['Freeman, Ashley T', 'Wood, William A', 'Fox, Alexandra', 'Hanson, Laura C']","['Freeman AT', 'Wood WA', 'Fox A', 'Hanson LC']","['1 Division of Hematology and Oncology, The University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', '1 Division of Hematology and Oncology, The University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', '2 Palliative Care Program, Division of Geriatric Medicine, Center for Aging and Health, The University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', '2 Palliative Care Program, Division of Geriatric Medicine, Center for Aging and Health, The University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170810,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,,IM,"['Advance Care Planning/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*nursing', 'Male', 'North Carolina', 'Palliative Care/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Referral and Consultation/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*standards/statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['*advance care planning', '*leukemia', '*palliative care']",2017/08/11 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jpm.2017.0097 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2018 Feb;21(2):225-228. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2017.0097.

We herein describe the identification of a new series of molecules that demonstrated excellent selectivity for CDK4/6 over CDKs1, 7 and 9. RESULTS: Medicinal chemistry optimization led to the discovery of 58 and 69 that inhibited CDK4 and CDK4/6, respectively, with high potency and selectivity, and 58 and 69 exhibited potent antiproliferative activities in a panel of human cancer cell lines including leukemia, and cancers of the breast, colon, ovary, pancreas and prostate. CONCLUSION: Compounds 58 and 69 caused remarkable growth inhibition of melanoma cells, particularly the cells harboring multiple BRAF and NRAS mutations, via a CDK4/6-targeted mechanism of action.

However, the risk-benefit ratio of the treatment of invasive aspergillosis with voriconazole in patients receiving vincristine-based chemotherapy remains unclear. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report severe peripheral and central neurological disorders in a 14-year-old girl with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and pulmonary aspergillosis. The case describes a strong exacerbation by voriconazole of the vincristine-induced neuropathic pains. It shows the high variability of the trough serum concentration of voriconazole leading to antifungal treatment failure and suggests that its own central neurotoxicity could also be potentiated by vincristine.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the clinicopathological features of 46 patients diagnosed consecutively with CD4(+) /CD56(+) iHLM. These cases were categorised into three groups based on their immunohistochemical expression of three plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) markers [CD123, CD303 and T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (TCL1)]: cutaneous BPDCN (n = 35), non-cutaneous BPDCN (n = 6) and non-BPDCN-type CD56(+) neoplasms (n = 5). Compared to non-cutaneous BPDCN, cutaneous BPDCN was associated with an older median age at onset (72 years versus 45 years, P < 0.05), and higher positivity for CD4 (P < 0.05), CD123 (P < 0.05) and 2-3 pDC markers (89% versus 50%, P = 0.05). Cutaneous BPDCN was divided into terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)(+) and TdT(-) subgroups, which did not differ in prognosis, although TdT(+) cases showed a lower median onset age (66 years versus 79 years, P < 0.05) and higher frequency of extracutaneous lesions (P < 0.05). Compared to the BPDCN groups, non-BPDCN-type CD56(+) neoplasm cases showed higher cytoplasmic CD3 positivity (P < 0.05) and less frequent BCL-2 expression (P < 0.05), and lacked cutaneous lesions. However, the survival curves overlapped. Notably, one case involved an unusual composite neoplasm, comprising CD56(+) lymphoblastic lymphoma and mature CD56(+) cytotoxic T cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our present data support the recognition of cutaneous BPDCN as a homogenous entity, in contrast to the non-cutaneous form. Additional research is warranted to characterise non-BPDCN-type CD56(+) neoplasms.","['Suzuki, Yuka', 'Kato, Seiichi', 'Kohno, Kei', 'Satou, Akira', 'Eladl, Ahmed E', 'Asano, Naoko', 'Kono, Michihiro', 'Kato, Yuichi', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Akiyama, Masashi', 'Nakamura, Shigeo']","['Suzuki Y', 'Kato S', 'Kohno K', 'Satou A', 'Eladl AE', 'Asano N', 'Kono M', 'Kato Y', 'Taniwaki M', 'Akiyama M', 'Nakamura S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Aichi Medical University Hospital, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics, Nagano Prefectural Suzaka Hospital, Suzaka, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology, Hematology, Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetology, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Center for Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171010,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', 'cutaneous BPDCN', 'cytotoxic molecule', 'non-BPDCN-type CD56+ neoplasms', 'terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase']",2017/08/11 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13340 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2017 Dec;71(6):972-984. doi: 10.1111/his.13340.

In order to clarify individual differences in NK cell responses among patients treated with Das, we retrospectively analyzed the association between polymorphisms in the natural killer group 2D receptor [NKG2D; also known as killer cell lectin like receptor K1 (KLRK1)] gene and clinical outcomes in 31 patients treated with Das as first-line treatment for CML. Patients with the NKG2D HNK1/HNK1 (high-cytotoxic activity-related allele on NKG2D hb-1) haplotype achieved MR4.5 more quickly than those with other haplotypes [hazard ratio (HR) 4.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.75-118.6; P = 0.004]. In addition, NK cells with the NKG2D HNK1 allele exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (VAV1) at Tyr174.

While particle-induced loosening has been studied extensively, mechanisms through which mechanical factors lead to implant loosening have been less investigated. This study compares the transcriptional profiles associated with osteolysis in a rat model for aseptic loosening, induced by either mechanical instability or titanium particles. Rats were exposed to mechanical instability or titanium particles. After 15 min, 3, 48 or 120 h from start of the stimulation, gene expression changes in periprosthetic bone tissue was determined by microarray analysis. Microarray data were analyzed by PANTHER Gene List Analysis tool and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Both types of osteolytic stimulation led to gene regulation in comparison to unstimulated controls after 3, 48 or 120 h. However, when mechanical instability was compared to titanium particles, no gene showed a statistically significant difference (fold change >/= +/- 1.5 and adjusted p-value </= 0.05) at any time point. There was a remarkable similarity in numbers and functional classification of regulated genes. Pathway analysis showed several inflammatory pathways activated by both stimuli, including Acute Phase Response signaling, IL-6 signaling and Oncostatin M signaling. Quantitative PCR confirmed the changes in expression of key genes involved in osteolysis observed by global transcriptomics. Inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)2, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (Ptgs)2 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) showed strong upregulation, as assessed by both microarray and qPCR. By investigating genome-wide expression changes we show that, despite the different nature of mechanical implant instability and titanium particles, osteolysis seems to be induced through similar biological and signaling pathways in this rat model for aseptic loosening. Pathways associated to the innate inflammatory response appear to be a major driver for osteolysis. Our findings implicate early restriction of inflammation to be critical to prevent or mitigate osteolysis and aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants.","['Amirhosseini, Mehdi', 'Andersson, Goran', 'Aspenberg, Per', 'Fahlgren, Anna']","['Amirhosseini M', 'Andersson G', 'Aspenberg P', 'Fahlgren A']","['Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Orthopedics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170729,United States,Bone Rep,Bone reports,101646176,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aseptic loosening', 'Implant', 'Instability', 'Microarray', 'Wear debris']",2017/08/11 06:00,2017/08/11 06:01,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bonr.2017.07.003 [doi]', 'S2352-1872(17)30021-9 [pii]']",epublish,Bone Rep. 2017 Jul 29;7:17-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bonr.2017.07.003. eCollection 2017 Dec.,,,,PMC5544474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system is well involved in the development of several primary and secondary tumors including breast cancer, prostate cancer, bone tumors, and leukemia. The signaling of this triad system has also been linked to tumor invasiveness in the advanced stage. Bone is by far the most common site of cancer metastasis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate promoter methylation of BCL11B gene and its mRNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients in relation to healthy controls and evaluate their correlation with diseases clinical indices. Fifty AS patients and 50 healthy controls entered in this study. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood and RNA and DNA contents of leukocytes were extracted. The expression level of BCL11B gene was measured through real-time PCR assay using SYBR Green Master Mix, and PCR products of bisulfite-treated DNA were sequenced to determine the methylation level of promoter. Decreased transcript and increased promoter methylation levels of BCL11B gene were identified in AS patients compared with healthy controls. Hypermethylation of CpG3 and CpG5 was associated with increased AS risk. Promoter hypermethylation and mRNA overexpression correlated with each other but not with clinical manifestations. We identified aberrancies in expression and methylation of BCL11B gene in AS patients compared with healthy control group; however, they might not impress the clinical face of AS.","['Karami, J', 'Mahmoudi, M', 'Amirzargar, A', 'Gharshasbi, M', 'Jamshidi, A', 'Aslani, S', 'Nicknam, M H']","['Karami J', 'Mahmoudi M', 'Amirzargar A', 'Gharshasbi M', 'Jamshidi A', 'Aslani S', 'Nicknam MH']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Rheumatology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Genetic Department, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Rheumatology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Rheumatology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170810,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/blood/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/08/11 06:00,2018/02/08 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['gene201717 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2017.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2017 Sep;18(3):170-175. doi: 10.1038/gene.2017.17.

TOP2-induced DNA double-strand breaks are rejoined in part by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2)-dependent non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), but whether this process suppresses or promotes TOP2-induced translocations is unclear. Here, we show that TDP2 rejoins DSBs induced during transcription-dependent TOP2 activity in breast cancer cells and at the translocation 'hotspot', MLL. Moreover, we find that TDP2 suppresses chromosome rearrangements induced by TOP2 and reduces TOP2-induced chromosome translocations that arise during gene transcription. Interestingly, however, we implicate TDP2-dependent NHEJ in the formation of a rare subclass of translocations associated previously with therapy-related leukemia and characterized by junction sequences with 4-bp of perfect homology. Collectively, these data highlight the threat posed by TOP2-induced DSBs during transcription and demonstrate the importance of TDP2-dependent non-homologous end-joining in protecting both gene transcription and genome stability.DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by topoisomerase II (TOP2) are rejoined by TDP2-dependent non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) but whether this promotes or suppresses translocations is not clear.

However, very less is known if MSCs can be differentiated towards renal lineages and their further application potential in kidney injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study developed a conditioning system of growth factors fibroblast growth factor 2, transforming growth factor-beta2, and leukemia inhibitory factor for in vitro differentiation of MSCs isolated from different sources towards nephrogenic lineage. Less invasively isolated adipose-derived MSCs were also compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs for their differentiation potential to induce renal cell. Differentiated MSCs were further evaluated for their resistance to oxidative stress induced by oxygen peroxide. RESULTS: A combination of growth factors successfully induced differentiation of MSCs. Both types of differentiated cells showed significant expression of pronephrogenic markers (Wnt4, Wt1, and Pax2) and renal epithelial markers (Ecad and ZO1). In contrast, expression of mesenchymal stem cells marker Oct4 and Vim were downregulated. Furthermore, differentiated adipose-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived MSCs showed enhanced and comparable resistance to oxygen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Adipose-derived MSC provides a promising alternative to bone marrow-derived MSC as a source of autologous stem cells in human kidney injuries. In addition, differentiated MSCs with further in vivo investigations may serve as a cell source for tissue engineering or cell therapy in different renal ailments.","['Tayyeb, Asima', 'Shahzad, Naveed', 'Ali, Gibran']","['Tayyeb A', 'Shahzad N', 'Ali G']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of the Punjab Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan. asima.sbs@pu.edu.pk.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Iran,Iran J Kidney Dis,Iranian journal of kidney diseases,101316967,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Peroxides)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*cytology', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Culture Media/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Kidney/*cytology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Peroxides/*toxicity', 'Phenotype', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,,2017/08/11 06:00,2018/05/02 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['3000/933 [pii]'],ppublish,Iran J Kidney Dis. 2017 Jul;11(4):271-279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that short-term exposure of mice to the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib induced the transient quiescence of multipotent progenitors (MPPs). This property of quizartinib conferred marked protection to MPPs in mice receiving fluorouracil or gemcitabine. The protection resulted in the rapid recovery of bone marrow and blood cellularity, thus preventing otherwise lethal myelosuppression. A treatment strategy involving quizartinib priming that protected wild-type bone marrow progenitors, but not leukemic cells, from fluorouracil provided a more effective treatment than conventional induction therapy in mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia. This strategy has the potential to be extended for use in other cancers where FLT3 inhibition does not adversely affect the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Thus, the addition of quizartinib to cancer treatment regimens could markedly improve cancer patient survival and quality of life.","['Taylor, Samuel J', 'Duyvestyn, Johanna M', 'Dagger, Samantha A', 'Dishington, Emma J', 'Rinaldi, Catherine A', 'Dovey, Oliver M', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Grove, Carolyn S', 'Langdon, Wallace Y']","['Taylor SJ', 'Duyvestyn JM', 'Dagger SA', 'Dishington EJ', 'Rinaldi CA', 'Dovey OM', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Grove CS', 'Langdon WY']","['School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'PathWest Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Nedlands, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia 6009, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia. wally.langdon@uwa.edu.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzothiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,,2017/08/11 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['9/402/eaam8060 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aam8060 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2017 Aug 9;9(402). pii: 9/402/eaam8060. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aam8060.,['MC_PC_12009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Although type I IFN induces an antiviral state in many cell types, HIV-1 can replicate in vivo via mechanisms that have remained unclear. We have recently identified a type I IFN-inducible protein, CD169, as the HIV-1 attachment factor on dendritic cells (DCs) that can mediate robust infection of CD4(+) T cells in trans Since CD169 expression on macrophages is also induced by type I IFN, we hypothesized that type I IFN-inducible CD169 could facilitate productive HIV-1 infection in myeloid cells in cis and CD4(+) T cells in trans and thus offset antiviral effects of type I IFN. In support of this hypothesis, infection of HIV-1 or murine leukemia virus Env (MLV-Env)-pseudotyped HIV-1 particles was enhanced in IFN-alpha-treated THP-1 monocytoid cells, and this enhancement was primarily dependent on CD169-mediated enhancement at the virus entry step, a phenomenon phenocopied in HIV-1 infections of IFN-alpha-treated primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Furthermore, expression of CD169, a marker of type I IFN-induced immune activation in vivo, was enhanced in lymph nodes from pigtailed macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) carrying HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT-SHIV), compared to uninfected macaques, and interestingly, there was extensive colocalization of p27(gag) and CD169, suggesting productive infection of CD169(+) myeloid cells in vivo While cell-free HIV-1 infection of IFN-alpha-treated CD4(+) T cells was robustly decreased, initiation of infection in trans via coculture with CD169(+) IFN-alpha-treated DCs restored infection, suggesting that HIV-1 exploits CD169 in cis and in trans to attenuate a type I IFN-induced antiviral state.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 infection in humans causes immune activation characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons (IFN). Although type I IFN induces an antiviral state in many cell types in vitro, HIV-1 can replicate in vivo via mechanisms that have remained unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CD169, a type I IFN-inducible HIV-1 attachment factor, offsets antiviral effects of type I IFN. Infection of HIV-1 was rescued in IFN-alpha-treated myeloid cells via upregulation of CD169 and a subsequent increase in CD169-dependent virus entry. Furthermore, extensive colocalization of viral Gag and CD169 was observed in lymph nodes of infected pigtailed macaques, suggesting productive infection of CD169(+) cells in vivo Treatment of dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures with IFN-alpha upregulated CD169 expression on DCs and rescued HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) T cells in trans, suggesting that HIV-1 exploits CD169 to attenuate type I IFN-induced restrictions.","['Akiyama, Hisashi', 'Ramirez, Nora-Guadalupe Pina', 'Gibson, Gregory', 'Kline, Christopher', 'Watkins, Simon', 'Ambrose, Zandrea', 'Gummuluru, Suryaram']","['Akiyama H', 'Ramirez NP', 'Gibson G', 'Kline C', 'Watkins S', 'Ambrose Z', 'Gummuluru S']","['Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Center for Biologic Imaging and Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Physiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Biologic Imaging and Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Physiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA rgummulu@bu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171013,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (SIGLEC1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'HIV Infections/*drug therapy/metabolism/virology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Macaca nemestrina', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/metabolism/virology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD169', '*HIV', '*type I IFN', '*virus entry', '*virus evasion']",2017/08/11 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00972-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00972-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Oct 13;91(21). pii: JVI.00972-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00972-17.

All three MLV subgroups are linked to leukemogenesis, which involves generation of recombinants with polytropic host range. Although P-MLVs are deemed to be the proximal agents of disease induction, few biologically characterized infectious P-MLVs have been sequenced for comparative analysis. We analyzed the complete genomes of 16 naturally occurring infectious P-MLVs, 12 of which were typed for pathogenic potential. We sought to identify ERV progenitors, recombinational hot spots, and segments that are always replaced, never replaced, or linked to pathogenesis or host range. Each P-MLV has an E-MLV backbone with P- or X-ERV replacements that together cover 100% of the recombinant genomes, with different substitution patterns for X- and P-ERVs. Two segments are always replaced, both coding for envelope (Env) protein segments: the N terminus of the surface subunit and the cytoplasmic tail R peptide. Viral gag gene replacements are influenced by host restriction genes Fv1 and Apobec3 Pathogenic potential maps to the env transmembrane subunit segment encoding the N-heptad repeat (HR1). Molecular dynamics simulations identified three novel interdomain salt bridges in the lymphomagenic virus HR1 that could affect structural stability, entry or sensitivity to host immune responses. The long terminal repeats of lymphomagenic P-MLVs are differentially altered by recombinations, duplications, or mutations. This analysis of the naturally occurring, sometimes pathogenic P-MLV recombinants defines the limits and extent of intersubgroup recombination and identifies specific sequence changes linked to pathogenesis and host interactions.IMPORTANCE During virus-induced leukemogenesis, ecotropic mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs) recombine with nonecotropic endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) to produce polytropic MLVs (P-MLVs). Analysis of 16 P-MLV genomes identified two segments consistently replaced: one at the envelope N terminus that alters receptor choice and one in the R peptide at the envelope C terminus, which is removed during virus assembly. Genome-wide analysis shows that nonecotropic replacements in the progenitor ecotropic MLV genome are more extensive than previously appreciated, covering 100% of the genome; contributions from xenotropic and polytropic ERVs differentially alter the regions responsible for receptor determination or subject to APOBEC3 and Fv1 restriction. All pathogenic viruses had modifications in the regulatory elements in their long terminal repeats and differed in a helical segment of envelope involved in entry and targeted by the host immune system. Virus-induced leukemogenesis thus involves generation of complex recombinants, and specific replacements are linked to pathogenesis and host restrictions.","['Bamunusinghe, Devinka', 'Liu, Qingping', 'Plishka, Ronald', 'Dolan, Michael A', 'Skorski, Matthew', 'Oler, Andrew J', 'Yedavalli, Venkat R K', 'Buckler-White, Alicia', 'Hartley, Janet W', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Bamunusinghe D', 'Liu Q', 'Plishka R', 'Dolan MA', 'Skorski M', 'Oler AJ', 'Yedavalli VRK', 'Buckler-White A', 'Hartley JW', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA ckozak@niaid.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20171013,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Viral', 'Host Specificity/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*classification/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Sequence Homology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*origins of infectious gammaretroviruses', '*pathogenic mouse gammaretroviruses', '*polytropic mouse gammaretroviruses', '*recombinant retroviruses', '*retroviral N-heptad repeat']",2017/08/11 06:00,2017/11/10 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00855-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00855-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Oct 13;91(21). pii: JVI.00855-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00855-17.

However, in 2016 revision to the WHO classification, the subcategory of AEL has been removed. Myeloblasts are redefined as the percentage of total marrow cells, not non-erythroid cells. Therefore, the previously diagnosed AEL cases are currently diagnosed as AML or myelodyspalstic syndrome (MDS) according to new criteria. METHODS: We respectively reviewed cases of 97 de novo previously diagnosed AEL and all the patients were diagnosed as AML or MDS according to the new classification scheme, and then the clinical characteristics of these two subtypes were compared. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software version 18.0. RESULTS: The median age was 37 years-old, the two-thirds of previous AEL cases were diagnosed as MDS, and there was no obvious difference between two subtypes except for male/female ratio and age. Cytogenetic, rather than MDS/AML subtypes, can better represent the prognostic factor of previously diagnosed AEL patients. When the cytogenetic risk of patients belonged to MRC intermediate category and age were below 40 years-old in previous AEL cases, the patients who received induction chemotherapy without transplantation had a similar survival compared with the patients who underwent transplantation (3-year OS: 67.2% vs 68.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetic, rather than MDS/AML subtypes, can better represent the prognostic factor of previously diagnosed AEL patients. Transplantation was a better choice for those whose cytogenetic category was unfavorable.","['Qiu, Shaowei', 'Jiang, Erlie', 'Wei, Hui', 'Lin, Dong', 'Zhang, Guangji', 'Wei, Shuning', 'Zhou, Chunlin',

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In our study, 20(S)-Rh2 induced the expression of orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 and death receptor proteins Fas, FasL, DR5, and TRAIL, as well as the cleavage of caspase 8 and caspase 3 in HL-60 cells. Importantly, shNur77 attenuated 20(S)-Rh2-induced apoptosis and Fas and DR5 expression. Meanwhile, 20(S)-Rh2 promoted Nur77 translocation from the nucleus to mitochondria and enhanced the interaction between Nur77 and Bcl-2, resulting in the exposure of the BH3 domain of Bcl-2 and activation of Bax. Furthermore, 20(S)-Rh2 promoted the differentiation of HL-60 cells as evidenced by Wright-Giemsa staining, NBT reduction assay, and detection of the myeloid differentiation marker CD11b by flow cytometry. Notably, shNur77 reversed 20(S)-Rh2-mediated HL-60 differentiation. Additionally, 20(S)-Rh2 also exhibited an antileukemic effect and induced Nur77 expression in NOD/SCID mice with the injection of HL-60 cells into the tail vein. Together, our studies suggest that the Nur77-mediated signaling pathway is highly involved in 20(S)-Rh2-induced apoptosis and differentiation of AML cells.","['Wang, Chengqiang', 'He, Hui', 'Dou, Guojun', 'Li, Juan', 'Zhang, Xiaomei', 'Jiang, Mingdong', 'Li, Pan', 'Huang, Xiaobo', 'Chen, Hongxi', 'Li, Li', 'Yang, Dajian', 'Qi, Hongyi']","['Wang C', 'He H', 'Dou G', 'Li J', 'Zhang X', 'Jiang M', 'Li P', 'Huang X', 'Chen H', 'Li L', 'Yang D', 'Qi H']","['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University , 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University , 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University , 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University , 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', ""Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica , 34 Nanshan Road, Nan'an District, Chongqing 400065, China."", ""Radiotherapy Department, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital , Jialing Village 69, Beibei District, Chongqing 400700, China."", ""Radiotherapy Department, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital , Jialing Village 69, Beibei District, Chongqing 400700, China."", ""Radiotherapy Department, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital , Jialing Village 69, Beibei District, Chongqing 400700, China."", ""Radiotherapy Department, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital , Jialing Village 69, Beibei District, Chongqing 400700, China."", 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University , 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', ""Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica , 34 Nanshan Road, Nan'an District, Chongqing 400065, China."", 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University , 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170823,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'ginsenoside', 'hematologic malignancy', 'immediate-early gene', 'myeloid differentiation']",2017/08/11 06:00,2017/09/16 06:00,['2017/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jafc.7b02299 [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2017 Sep 6;65(35):7687-7697. doi: 10.1021/acs.jafc.7b02299.

This study aims to identify novel targets for explaining the dilemmas. METHODS: We analyzed four microarray gene expression profiles to investigate changes in whole genome expression associated with FLT3-ITD mutation. RESULTS: We identified 22 differentially expressed genes which are commonly expressed among all four profiles. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the dataset GSE12417 revealed that low expression of AHSP, EPB42, GYPC and HEMGN predicted poor prognosis (AHSP: P=0.0317, HR=1.894; EPB42: P=0.0382, HR=1.859; GYPC: P=0.0015, HR=2.051; HEMGN: P=0.0418, HR=1.838 in GSE12417 test cohort; AHSP: P=0.0279, HR=1.548; EPB42: P=0.0398, HR=1.505; GYPC: P=0.0408, HR=1.501; HEMGN: P=0.0143, HR=1.630 in GSE12417 validation cohort). When patients were FLT3-ITD positive, the expression of FLT3 was significantly increased (all P<0.05 in four profiles), and correleation analysis of four profiles revealed that the expression of the four candidate genes negatively correlated with FLT3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that AHSP, EPB42, GYPC and HEMGN may be suitable biomarkers for diagnostic or therapeutic strategies for FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients.","['Zhu, Gang-Zhi', 'Yang, Yong-Long', 'Zhang, Yan-Jiao', 'Liu, Wei', 'Li, Mu-Peng', 'Zeng, Wen-Jing', 'Zhao, Xie-Lan', 'Chen, Xiao-Ping']","['Zhu GZ', 'Yang YL', 'Zhang YJ', 'Liu W', 'Li MP', 'Zeng WJ', 'Zhao XL', 'Chen XP']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', ""Haikou People's Hospital and Affiliated Haikou Hospital of Xiangya Medical School, Central South University, Haikou, China."", ""Haikou People's Hospital and Affiliated Haikou Hospital of Xiangya Medical School, Central South University, Haikou, China."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170809,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (AHSP protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (HEMGN protein, human)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.2 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Glycophorins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/metabolism/mortality', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AHSP', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'EPB42', 'FLT3-ITD', 'GYPC', 'HEMGN']",2017/08/10 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['000479837 [pii]', '10.1159/000479837 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;42(5):1973-1984. doi: 10.1159/000479837.

They deliver and release cytotoxic agents at the tumor site, reducing the likelihood of systemic exposure and therefore toxicity. These agents should improve the potency of chemotherapy by increasing the accumulation of cytotoxic the drug within or near the neoplastic cells with reduced systemic effects. Areas covered: A literature review was conducted of the MEDLINE database PubMed for articles in English examining Mabs, B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors and immunomodulating drugs. Publications from 2000 through April 2017 were scrutinized. Conference proceedings from the previous five years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. Expert opinion: Newer ADCs show promise as treatment for several hematologic malignancies, especially lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. However, definitive data from ongoing and future clinical trials will aid in better defining the status of these agents in the treatment of these diseases.","['Wolska-Washer, Anna', 'Robak, Pawel', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Wolska-Washer A', 'Robak P', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak T']","['a Department of Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.', 'b Department of Experimental Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.', 'b Department of Experimental Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.', 'a Department of Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170828,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*A-dmDT390-bisFv', '*ADCT-301', '*AGS67E', '*Anti-FcrL5', '*DCDT2980S', '*DCDTS4501A', '*LMB-2', '*SAR-3419', '*antibody-drug conjugate', '*brentuximab vedotin', '*combotox', '*denileukin diftitox', '*denintuzumab mafodotin', '*indatuximab ravtansine', '*inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*leukemia', '*lorvotuzumab mertansine', '*lymphoma', '*milotuzumab-dox', '*moxetumomab pasudotox', '*multiple myeloma', '*pinatuzumab vedotin', '*polatuzumab vedotin', '*resimmune']",2017/08/10 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728214.2017.1366447 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2017 Sep;22(3):259-273. doi: 10.1080/14728214.2017.1366447.

Our institution screens patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for viral DNAemia by PCR as part of clinical care. PROCEDURE: This retrospective chart review included patients treated for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML or ALL between April 2010 and September 2014. We retrieved data for viral PCR screening, detection and quantification, duration of positivity, and prophylaxis or treatment. RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients were included in analyses. Forty (36.0%) had at least one blood PCR positive for EBV, CMV, or adenovirus. Patients with ALL had significantly higher rates of persistent viral detection and treatment than those with AML (P < 0.02, P < 0.01, respectively). International patients had significantly higher rates of viral detection (P < 0.01), persistence (P < 0.01), any treatment (P < 0.03), and antiviral treatment (P < 0.01); 16.9% of patients who received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prophylactically had viral detection compared to 63% of patients who did not receive prophylactic IVIG (P = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALL were more susceptible than those with AML to viral reactivation that was persistent or resulted in treatment. Patients with relapsed ALL, refractory ALL, or infantile ALL are most likely to benefit from asymptomatic screening for CMV and adenovirus. International patients are at higher risk for reactivation and may merit screening.

KIT mutations were identified in 30% of the CBF-AML cohort. The KIT mutations were clustered in exon 17 and exon 8, and KIT mutations in exons 8 and 17 were correlated with a shorter overall survival (OS) (5-year OS: 30.0 +/- 14.5% vs. 73.0 +/- 8.5%, p = .007) and event-free survival (EFS) (5-year EFS: 30.0 +/- 14.5% vs. 73.0 +/- 8.5%, p = .003). Multivariate analysis revealed KIT mutations as an independent risk factor in CBF-AML.

Diagnosis of ALL is made by evaluating morphology and flowcytometric Immunophenotyping (FCI)and is an important adjunct in diagnosis and determining treatment in ALL, with availability of extensive monoclonal antibodies in the recent years there is tremendous progress in the field of FCI, and is a requirement by World Health Organisation for the classification of acute lymphoblastic Leukemia. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the leukemic blasts helps in categorization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia as B-ALL or T-ALL. Though ALL is the most common cancer, there is paucity of study in Indian scenario, and very few reports of immunologically subtyping of ALL is reported. AIM: To confirm the clinical/morphological diagnosis and to determine immunological subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia as per requirement by World Health Organization for the classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: At Kidwai State Cancer institute, Bangalore, we have performed of Immunophenotyping in 1425 untreated cases of acute leukemias during January 2012 - August 2015. RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis of 1425 cases of acute Leukemias were performed, 918 (64.42%) were acute lymphoblastic Leukemia, 688 were B-ALL (74.94%), majority(480) of B-ALL were in children (69.76%), 230 were T-ALL (25.05 %), B-ALL was the most common subtype of acute leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common leukemia in adults and children. Immunophenotping helps in confirming the clinical/morphological diagnosis and in determining the immunological subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thus has an important role in deciding on the treatment regime. ALL is the disease of lymphoid precursors and is more common cancer in children than adults. B-ALL was the most common subtype of acute leukemias both in adults and in children. T-ALL is less common in pediatric population. Flowcytometric techniques are used to measure (submicroscopic) minimal residual disease (MRD), and is currently incorporated in many ALL treatment protocols as a tool for risk stratification.","['Rajkumar, Namrata N', 'Vijay, Raghavendra H']","['Rajkumar NN', 'Vijay RH']","['Hon Professor, Department of Haematology, KEM Hospital, Consultant Haematologist, Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hon Professor, Department of Haematology, KEM Hospital, Consultant Haematologist, Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'India/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'World Health Organization']",,,2017/08/10 06:00,2018/09/19 06:00,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 2017 Jul;65(7):14-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis of diseases such as Wilms tumor, WAGR, Denys-Drash or Frasier syndromes are congenital WT1 mutations, while somatic mutations of this gene occur in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and also in some other blood neoplasms, as acute lymphoblood leukemia. Increased expression of this gene without its mutation is observed in leukemias and solid tumors. The WT1 may function both as a tumor suppressor gene and as an oncogene.

Surprisingly scarce data is available on the combinatory effects of PARP inhibitors with DNA damaging antitumor drugs in leukemic cells (primary cells or established lines). OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of PJ-34 (PARP-1 inhibitor) on the cytotoxicity of different antileukemic drugs with different DNA damaging mechanisms and potency (doxorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine and chlorambucil) in human leukemic Jurkat and HL-60 cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different exposure scenarios were applied: 1) 72 h simultaneous incubation with PJ-34 (2.5 or 5 muM for Jurkat and HL-60 cells, respectively) and a drug used at a wide concentration range; 2) preincubation of the cells with PJ-34 for 24 h and then with a combination of PJ-34 + drug for an additional 48 h; 3) preincubation of the cells with the drug for 24 h with a subsequent incubation with a combination of PJ-34 + drug for an additional 48 h. Cytotoxicity was assessed using a WST-1 reduction test. RESULTS: It was determined that PJ-34, when used in all 3 scenarios, did not induce any significant enhancement of cytotoxicity of the drugs either in Jurkat or in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results do not confirm the beneficial effects of PARP inhibition in combination treatment of the leukemic cells, we propose that future studies including an additional step with the inhibition of DNA repair by homologous recombination should provide promising results.","['Stepnik, Maciej', 'Spryszynska, Sylwia', 'Gorzkiewicz, Anna', 'Ferlinska, Magdalena']","['Stepnik M', 'Spryszynska S', 'Gorzkiewicz A', 'Ferlinska M']","['Department of Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (N-(oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide hydrochloride)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Phenanthrenes', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['PJ-34', 'chlorambucil', 'cytarabine', 'doxorubicin', 'etoposide']",2017/08/10 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17219/acem/60848 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2017 May-Jun;26(3):379-385. doi: 10.17219/acem/60848.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increasing number of CML patients of reproductive age are diagnosed each year, and the impact of imatinib on fertility is a major concern. Providing useful advice to these patients regarding the choice of their therapeutic treatment is very important. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of imatinib on the fertility of male patients with CML in the chronic phase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a study of 48 adult male CML patients in the chronic phase (CML-CP), 50 healthy control subjects, and 10 male patients with infertility. Imatinib levels in semen and plasma were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. We examined the effects of imatinib on sperm parameters and the male reproductive system using a computer-assisted sperm assay and ultrasound, respectively. We analysed sex hormone levels in the sera of CML-CP patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Imatinib levels in semen were comparable to plasma levels in CML-CP patients. CML-CP patients treated with imatinib exhibited reduced sperm density, counts, survival rates, and activity. Ultrasound demonstrated that the shape and size of the testis and epididymis in CML-CP patients undergoing imatinib treatment were normal. However, 19 of these patients exhibited a hydrocele in their tunica vaginalis, with a large dark area of effusion (0.7-2.9 cm in width). Sex hormone levels in the sera of the CML-CP patients were normal. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that imatinib crosses the blood-testis barrier and reduces sperm density, sperm count, survival rates, and activity in CML-CP patients. However, imatinib did not affect the structure of reproductive organs or sex hormone levels.","['Chang, Xiaohui', 'Zhou, Lin', 'Chen, Xiaoxia', 'Xu, Baoli', 'Cheng, Yubin', 'Sun, Shujun', 'Fang, Meiyun', 'Xiang, Yang']","['Chang X', 'Zhou L', 'Chen X', 'Xu B', 'Cheng Y', 'Sun S', 'Fang M', 'Xiang Y']","[""Department of Hematology, The 210th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liaoning, China."", ""Department of Scientific Research, The 210th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liaoning, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy, The Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Liaoning, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liaoning, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The 210th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liaoning, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The 210th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liaoning, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning, China. fangmeiyun@medmail.com.cn.', ""Department of Hematology, The 210th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liaoning, China. 66463875@qq.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Fertility/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male']",,,2017/08/10 06:00,2018/08/03 06:00,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11523-017-0521-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11523-017-0521-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Target Oncol. 2017 Dec;12(6):827-832. doi: 10.1007/s11523-017-0521-6.,['2015020411-301/National Nature Science Foundation of Liaoning Province'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that the concomitant inhibition of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic activities is able to trigger apoptosis in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. In this context, siRNA-mediated BclxL and Mcl-1 inhibition constitutes an appealing strategy by which to eliminate chemoresistant cancer cells. However, the safest and most efficient way to vectorize siRNAs in vivo is still under debate. In the present study, using in vivo bioluminescence imaging, we evaluated the interest of atelocollagen to vectorize siRNAs by intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration in 2 xenografted ovarian cancer models (peritoneal carcinomatosis and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice). Whereas i.p. administration of atelocollagen-vectorized siRNA in the peritoneal carcinomatosis model did not induce any gene downregulation, a 70% transient downregulation of luciferase expression was achieved after i.v. injection of atelocollagen-vectorized siRNA in the subcutaneous (s.c.) model. However, the use of siRNA targeting Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 did not induce target-specific downregulation in vivo in nude mice. Our results therefore show that atelocollagen complex formulation, the administration route, tumor site and the identity of the siRNA target influence the efficiency of atelocollagenmediated siRNA delivery.","['Meryet-Figuiere, Matthieu', 'Lecerf, Charlotte', 'Varin, Emilie', 'Coll, Jean-Luc', 'Louis, Marie-Helene', 'Dutoit, Soizic', 'Giffard, Florence', 'Blanc-Fournier, Cecile', 'Hedir, Siham', 'Vigneron, Nicolas', 'Brotin, Emilie', 'Pelletier, Laurent', 'Josserand, Veronique', 'Denoyelle, Christophe', 'Poulain, Laurent']","['Meryet-Figuiere M', 'Lecerf C', 'Varin E', 'Coll JL', 'Louis MH', 'Dutoit S', 'Giffard F', 'Blanc-Fournier C', 'Hedir S', 'Vigneron N', 'Brotin E', 'Pelletier L', 'Josserand V', 'Denoyelle C', 'Poulain L']","[""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1209, Institute of Advanced Biosciences, Institut pour l'Avancee des Biosciences, Centre de Recherche UGA, Site Sante, 38700 La Tronche, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", ""INSERM U1086 'ANTICIPE' Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Axe 2: 'Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Locally Aggressive Cancers' (BioTICLA), Comprehensive Cancer Center Francois Baclesse, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France."", 'INSERM U836, Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences, Batiment Edmond J.

The present study aimed to uncover the relevant molecular mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis and to explore potential biomarkers that may be used for prognosis. Expression profile microarray data GSE8977, which contained 22 stroma samples (15 were from normal breast and 7 were from invasive ductal carcinoma tumor samples), were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected based on analyses conducted using the linear models for microarray analysis package from R and Bioconductor software. The resulting data were used in subsequent function and pathway enrichment analyses, as well as proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network and subnetwork analyses. Transcription factors (TFs) and tumorassociated genes were also identified among the DEGs. A total of 234 DEGs were identified, which were enriched in immune response, cell differentiation and cell adhesionrelated functions and pathways. Downregulated DEGs included TFs, such as the protooncogene SPI1, preBcell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) and lymphoid enhancerbinding factor 1 (LEF1), as well as tumor suppressors (TSs), such as capping actin protein, gelsolin like (CAPG) and tumor protein p53inducible nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1). Upregulated DEGs also included TFs and tumor suppressors, consisting of transcription factor 7like 2 (TCF7L2) and pleiomorphic adenoma genelike 1 (PLAGL1). DEGs that were identified at the hub nodes in the PPI network and the subnetwork were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and spleenassociated tyrosine kinase (SYK), respectively. Several genes crucial in the metastasis of breast cancer were identified, which may serve as potential biomarkers, many of which were associated with cell adhesion, proliferation or immune response, and may influence breast cancer metastasis by regulating these function or pathways.","['Zheng, Tianying', 'Wang, Aijun', 'Hu, Dongyan', 'Wang, Yonggang']","['Zheng T', 'Wang A', 'Hu D', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Cancer Center, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

This study aimed to investigate the methylated status of SFRPs promoter region and its clinical relevance in Chinese non-M3 AML patients. METHODS: SFRPs methylation in 139 primary non-M3 AML patients was determined using methylation-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The frequency of aberrant methylation was as follows: 30.2% for SFRP1, 27.3% for SFRP2, 5.0% for SFRP4, and 1.4% for SFRP5. Hypermethylation of at least one SFRP gene occurred in 51.8% (72/139) of non-M3 AML patient samples, which was significantly higher compared to normal control (0/21) (P<0.001). Hypermethylation of SFRP1 was potentially associated with N/K-RAS mutations (P=0.043), and the frequency of SFRPs methylation was higher in patients >/=50 years compared to those <50 years, especially for SFRP2 (P<0.05). Furthermore, both whole cohort and cytogenetically normal (CN) patients with high SFRPs-methylated group showed a shorter overall survival (OS) compared to those with low group (P=0.036 and P=0.035, respectively). Moreover, Cox regression multivariate analysis revealed that SFRPs hypermethylation acts as an independent prognostic biomarker among both whole cohort (hazard ratio =1.804, P=0.026) and CN (hazard ratio =2.477, P=0.023) patients. In leukemic cell line HL60 treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, the alteration of SFRP1/2 expression inversely correlated with change in SFRP1/2 methylation (r=-0.975, P=0.005 and r=-0.975, P=0.005, respectively). A tendency of negative correlation was observed between SFRP1 expression and its promoter methylation in AML patients (r=-0.334, P=0.038). CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that hypermethylation of SFRP1/2 was a frequent event and silenced SFRP1/2 expression in AML. Moreover, hypermethylation of SFRPs promoter was an adverse risk factor for OS in Chinese non-M3 AML patients.","['Guo, Hong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'An, Cui', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Guo H', 'Zhang TJ', 'Wen XM', 'Zhou JD', 'Ma JC', 'An C', 'Zhang W', 'Xu ZJ', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Yu City, Dezhou, People's Republic of China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170720,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['RQ-MSP', 'SFRPs', 'methylation', 'non-M3 AML', 'prognosis']",2017/08/10 06:00,2017/08/10 06:01,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S136502 [doi]', 'ott-10-3635 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Jul 20;10:3635-3644. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S136502. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5530859,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-cell immunobased strategies open up new therapeutic perspectives. Blinatumomab is the first of a new class of antibody constructs that was labeled bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE): it consists of two single chain variable fragment connected with a flexible linker, one side binding CD3, the other CD19. The tight binding and the close proximity to the CD19-positive B-cells and leukemic cells leads to non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-cell activation, polyclonal T-cell expansion and direct target cell killing. Applied by continuous infusion, blinatumomab achieves morphological complete response rates ranging from 39% to 69% in R/R ALL patients (compared to 25% after second-line chemotherapy) with prolonged overall survival (blinatumomab median overall survival, 7.7 months vs chemotherapy, 4.0 months). In comparison to conventional cytotoxic second-line protocols blinatumomab has a favorable safety profile. The main adverse event is related to the mode of action of blinatumomab: the induction of a cytokine-release syndrome that can be managed by interruption and/or the application of steroids or tocilizumab. Another typical complication is the occurrence of neurological side effects, such as seizures and encephalopathy. This neurotoxicity is reversible after application of steroids and/or withdrawal of blinatumomab. Blinatumomab has proven to be a powerful therapeutic option in R/R ALL patients both adult and pediatric because of its efficacy and limited toxicity.","['Queudeville, Manon', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Ebinger, Martin']","['Queudeville M', 'Handgretinger R', 'Ebinger M']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170719,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['R/R precursor B-cell ALL', 'T-cell', 'blinatumomab', 'immunotherapy']",2017/08/10 06:00,2017/08/10 06:01,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S103470 [doi]', 'ott-10-3567 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Jul 19;10:3567-3578. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S103470. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5530848,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations cluster in the DNA-binding Runt domain and are thought to represent loss-of-function mutations, indicating that RUNX1 suppresses T-cell transformation. RUNX1 has been proposed to have tumor suppressor roles in T-cell leukemia homeobox 1/3-transformed human T-ALL cell lines and NOTCH1 T-ALL mouse models. Yet, retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens identify RUNX genes as collaborating oncogenes in MYC-driven leukemia mouse models. To elucidate RUNX1 function(s) in leukemogenesis, we generated Tal1/Lmo2/Rosa26-CreER(T2)Runx1(f/f) mice and examined leukemia progression in the presence of vehicle or tamoxifen. We found that Runx1 deletion inhibits mouse leukemic growth in vivo and that RUNX silencing in human T-ALL cells triggers apoptosis. We demonstrate that a small molecule inhibitor, designed to interfere with CBFbeta binding to RUNX proteins, impairs the growth of human T-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples. We demonstrate that a RUNX1 deficiency alters the expression of a crucial subset of TAL1- and NOTCH1-regulated genes, including the MYB and MYC oncogenes, respectively. These studies provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that RUNX1 has oncogenic roles and reveal RUNX1 as a novel therapeutic target in T-ALL.","['Choi, AHyun', 'Illendula, Anuradha', 'Pulikkan, John A', 'Roderick, Justine E', 'Tesell, Jessica', 'Yu, Jun', 'Hermance, Nicole', 'Zhu, Lihua Julie', 'Castilla, Lucio H', 'Bushweller, John H', 'Kelliher, Michelle A']","['Choi A', 'Illendula A', 'Pulikkan JA', 'Roderick JE', 'Tesell J', 'Yu J', 'Hermance N', 'Zhu LJ', 'Castilla LH', 'Bushweller JH', 'Kelliher MA']","['Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170808,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",,,2017/08/10 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2017/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32797-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-03-775536 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Oct 12;130(15):1722-1733. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-03-775536.

Combined data from karyotype, DNA index, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction screening for relevant abnormalities were centrally reviewed and were informative in 542 cases (88%), allowing classification in 10 exclusive primary cytogenetic subgroups and in secondary subgroups, including complex and monosomal karyotypes. Prognostic analyses focused on cumulative incidence of failure (including primary refractoriness and relapse), event-free survival, and overall survival. Only 2 subgroups, namely t(4;11)/KMT2A-AFF1 and 14q32/IGH translocations, displayed a significantly worse outcome in this context, still observed after adjustment for age and after censoring patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first remission at SCT time. A worse outcome was also observed in patients with low hypodiploidy/near triploidy, but this was likely related to their higher age and worse tolerance to therapy.

Microarray analysis and the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to analyze miRNA profiles of CD34(+) blasts and MVs.

Gene expression data of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSet GSE42221, which consists of 7 primary human B-precursor samples and 4 control B-cell progenitor lymphoblast samples from patients with pediatric ALL, were downloaded from the public GEO database. Linear Models for Microarray Analysis package for R statistical software was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, biclustering analysis of DEGs was performed using pheatmap package for R. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery tool. Additionally, Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes software was used to screen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of the DEGs, and Connectivity Map database was employed to obtain small-molecule drugs that were significantly associated with DEGs. In total, 116 genes were identified as DEGs in pediatric ALL, including 56 downregulated and 60 upregulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis identified that upregulated DEGs, including marker of proliferation Ki-67, cyclin F and nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1, were significantly enriched in mesenchymal cell differentiation and development processes, whilst downregulated DEGs, including bone marrow morphogenetic protein 2, semaphoring 3F and ephrin B1 were enriched in cell cycle process. Amongst the DEGs, 169 PPIs were identified. Notably, carbimazole and quinostatin were associated with DEGs. Additionally, a number of DEGs were targeted by the two drugs, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 and cell division cycle 20. Mesenchymal cell differentiation and development as well as cell cycle processes may be important for pediatric ALL. Quinostatin may be used as a potent supplementary drug for treating pediatric ALL.","['Kong, Limei', 'Zhang, Xiaowei', 'Li, Chao', 'Zhou, Liping']","['Kong L', 'Zhang X', 'Li C', 'Zhou L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The No. 6 People's Hospital of Jinan, Jinan, Shandong 250200, P.R.

TRAF6 has been implicated in the invasive growth and metastasis of various types of cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. In the present study, associations between multiple myeloma (MM) and TRAF6, its downstream component nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) were investigated. The TRAF6 protein expression levels of 18 patients were positively correlated with the protein levels of beta-2 microglobulin (r(2)=0.3472; P=0.01) and negatively correlated with albumin protein levels (r(2)=0.5494; P=0.0004). In vitro expression of the TRAF6 protein, phosphorylated transcription factor p65 and phosphorylated p100 in myeloma cell lines was induced by MSCs from patients with MM. In addition, the in vitro expression of TRAF6 was associated with an enhanced proliferation rate of myeloma cells, which was blocked by silencing TRAF6 using small interfering RNA. Due to the association between the TRAF6-NF-kappaB signaling pathway in myeloma cells and MSCs, this signaling pathway may be a useful prognostic and therapeutic target in myeloma.","['Huang, Hongming', 'Sun, Zhongwei', 'Wang, Xudong', 'Liu, Xinxin', 'Na, Wenxiu', 'Xu, Ruirong', 'Ding, Runsheng', 'Liu, Hong']","['Huang H', 'Sun Z', 'Wang X', 'Liu X', 'Na W', 'Xu R', 'Ding R', 'Liu H']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, P.R.

The results of the present study revealed that, following Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis, treatment of K562 cells with decitabine (DAC) combined with TKIs exhibits synergic effects. Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (SHP-1) and BCR-ABL fusion protein (BCR-ABL) (p210) form a complex in the K562 cell line, and in the primary cells derived from patients with CML. These results suggested that SHP-1 serves a role in regulating the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL (p210). In addition, SHP-1 expression increased, while BCR-ABL expression decreased in the group treated with DAC and TKIs combined group compared with the TKI monotherapy group. Treatment with imatinib (IM) demonstrated no effect on SHP-1 methylation in the K562 cell line; however, the methylation of SHP-1 was not determined in the combined IM and DAC therapy group. Treatment with DAC demonstrated the ability to activate the expression of silenced SHP-1 through demethylation, thus decreasing BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in an improved therapeutic effect on CML.","['Jiang, Li-Cai', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Jiang LC', 'Luo JM']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, P.R.

In this study, we analysed miR-125b expression in childhood ALL and evaluated its clinical utility for patients treated with Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocol. METHODS: The study included 272 bone marrow specimens obtained on diagnosis and on BFM day 33 from 125 patients and 64 healthy children. Following extraction, RNA was polyadenylated and reverse transcribed. miR-125b levels were quantified by quantitative PCR. Cytogenetics, immunohistotype and MRD were analysed according to international guidelines. RESULTS: Downregulated miR-125b levels were detected in childhood ALL patients and correlated with adverse prognosis. Following BFM induction, miR-125b levels were significantly increased, however, elevated day 33/diagnosis miR-125b ratio was associated with unfavourable disease features. Loss of miR-125b during diagnosis and higher day 33/diagnosis ratio were correlated with stronger risk for disease short-term relapse and patients' worse survival. Moreover, multivariate regression models highlighted the independent prognostic value of miR-125b for childhood ALL. Finally, the combination of miR-125b with clinically used disease markers clearly enhanced the prediction of patients' resistance to BFM chemotherapy.

Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however, many patients are resistant to this drug. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in imatinib-resistant CML cells under different drug treatments. GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO+AMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.","['Zhao, Yan-Hong', 'Zhang, Xue-Fang', 'Zhao, Yan-Qiu', 'Bai, Fan', 'Qin, Fan', 'Sun, Jing', 'Dong, Ying']","['Zhao YH', 'Zhang XF', 'Zhao YQ', 'Bai F', 'Qin F', 'Sun J', 'Dong Y']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China. zhyanred@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Qiqihaer Medical College, Qiqihaer, 161006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170808,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Substantial evidence has suggested that metformin is associated with decreased cancer risk and anticancer activity against diverse cancer cells. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has shown powerful activity for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and also induces growth arrest and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. In this study, we tested the combination of imatinib and metformin against HCT15 colorectal cancer cells for effects on cell viability, cell cycle and autophagy. Our data show that metformin synergistically enhances the imatinib cytotoxicity in HCT15 cells as indicated by combination and drug reduction indices. We also demonstrate that the combination causes synergistic down-regulation of pERK, cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phases via reduction of cyclin B1 level. Moreover, the combination resulted in autophagy induction as revealed by increased acidic vesicular organelles and cleaved form of LC3-II. Inhibition of autophagic process by chloroquine led to decreased cell viability, suggesting that induction of autophagy seems to play a cell protective role that may act against anticancer effects. In conclusion, our present data suggest that metformin in combination with imatinib might be a promising therapeutic option in colorectal cancer.","['Lee, Jaeryun', 'Park, Deokbae', 'Lee, Youngki']","['Lee J', 'Park D', 'Lee Y']","['Dept. of Medicine, Jeju National University School of Medicine, Jeju 690-756, Korea.', 'Dept. of Histology, Jeju National University School of Medicine, Jeju 690-756, Korea.', 'Dept. of Histology, Jeju National University School of Medicine, Jeju 690-756, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170630,Korea (South),Dev Reprod,Development & reproduction,101178352,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell viability', 'HCT15 colorectal cancer cell', 'Imatinib', 'Metformin']",2017/08/09 06:00,2017/08/09 06:01,['2017/08/09 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12717/DR.2017.21.2.139 [doi]', 'dr-21-2-139 [pii]']",ppublish,Dev Reprod. 2017 Jun;21(2):139-150. doi: 10.12717/DR.2017.21.2.139.

T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is one of the more aggressive yet uncommon non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Although there has been increasing research into T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, the molecular mechanisms of the antitumor effects of pterostilbene against this malignancy are still largely unknown. The aim of this study is to confirm the effects of pterostilbene in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Jurkat and Hut-78 cells treated with pterostilbene were evaluated for cell proliferation using Cell Counting Kit-8, and apoptosis, cell cycle progression, reactive oxygen species generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed using flow cytometry. The level of protein expression was detected by western blot. The results demonstrated that pterostilbene significantly inhibited the growth of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines in vitro and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, pterostilbene treatment markedly induced S-phase cell cycle arrest, which was accompanied by downregulation of cdc25A, cyclin A2, and CDK2. Pterostilbene also induced the generation of reactive oxygen species and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Recently, the baseline RDW was found to have clinical significance for assessing clinical outcome and severity of various pathological conditions including cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, cancers, leukemia, renal dysfunction and respiratory diseases. A myriad of factors, most of which ill-defined, have an impact on the red cell population dynamics (i.e., production, maturation and turnover). A delay in the red blood cell clearance in pathological conditions represents one of the leading determinants of increased anisocytosis. Further study of RDW may reveal new insight into inflammation mechanisms. In this review, we specifically discuss the current literature about the association of RDW in various disease conditions involving the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems. We also present some of the related measurements for their value in predicting clinical outcomes in such conditions. According to our data, RDW was found to be a valuable prognostic index in gastrointestinal disorders along with additional inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and platelet count) and current disease severity indices used in clinical practice.","['Goyal, Hemant', 'Lippi, Giuseppe', 'Gjymishka, Altin', 'John, Bijo', 'Chhabra, Rajiv', 'May, Elizabeth']","['Goyal H', 'Lippi G', 'Gjymishka A', 'John B', 'Chhabra R', 'May E']","['Hemant Goyal, Altin Gjymishka, Department of Internal Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA 31201, United States.', 'Hemant Goyal, Altin Gjymishka, Department of Internal Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA 31201, United States.', 'Hemant Goyal, Altin Gjymishka, Department of Internal Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA 31201, United States.', 'Hemant Goyal, Altin Gjymishka, Department of Internal Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA 31201, United States.', 'Hemant Goyal, Altin Gjymishka, Department of Internal Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA 31201, United States.', 'Hemant Goyal, Altin Gjymishka, Department of Internal Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA 31201, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Endoscopy/adverse effects', '*Erythrocyte Indices', '*Erythrocytes', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*blood/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute mesenteric ischemia', 'Colon cancer', ""Crohn's disease"", 'Gastrointestinal diseases', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Inflammatory bowel diseases', 'Pancreatitis', 'Red blood cell distribution width', 'Ulcerative colitis']",2017/08/09 06:00,2018/05/01 06:00,['2017/08/09 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v23.i27.4879 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2017 Jul 21;23(27):4879-4891. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v23.i27.4879.,,,,PMC5526758,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: No potential conflicts of interest.

Imaging studies of 101 patients with 204 intramammary lesions were included. Most patients were women (95%) with a median age of 64 years. IHM were classified as Non Hodgkin lymphoma (77.2%), plasmacytoma (11.9%), leukemia (9.9%), and Hodgkin lymphoma (1%). The mean lesion size was 15.8 +/- 10.1 mm. Most IHM presented in mammography as lesions with comparable density to the surrounding tissue, and a round or irregular shape with indistinct margins. On US, most lesions were of irregular shape with complex echo pattern and indistinct margins. MRI shows lesions with irregular or spiculated margins and miscellaneous enhancement patterns. Using US or MRI, IHM were more frequently classified as BI-RADS 4 or 5 than using mammography (96.2% and 89.3% versus 75.3%). IHM can present with miscellaneous radiological patterns.

To enable an unbiased estimation of the prediction model to new patients, besides the split test sets of 150 patients, we introduced another independent data set of 84 patients to evaluate the model. The Random Forest model with 14 features achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 0.827 +/- 0.031 on one set and an accuracy of 0.798 on the other, with the area under the curve of 0.902 +/- 0.027 and 0.904, respectively. The model performed well across different risk-level groups, with the best accuracy of 0.829 in the standard-risk group.

The target SNARE SNAP-23 has been shown to be important for MC exocytosis, and our previous studies revealed the presence of one basal (Thr(102)) and two induced (Ser(95) and Ser(120)) phosphorylation sites in its linker region. To study the role of SNAP-23 phosphorylation in the regulation of exocytosis, green fluorescence protein-tagged wild-type SNAP-23 (GFP-SNAP-23) and its phosphorylation mutants were transfected into rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) MCs. Studies on GFP-SNAP-23 transfected MCs revealed some dynamic changes in SNAP-23 membrane association. SNAP-23 was associated with plasma membrane in resting MCs, however, on activation a portion of it translocated to cytosol and internal membranes. These internal locations were secretory granule membranes. This dynamic change in the membrane association of SNAP-23 in MCs may be important for mediating internal granule-granule fusions in compound exocytosis.

Therefore, the discovery and characterization of novel GBPs and characterization of glycan-GBP interactions are significant to provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention of many diseases. Here, we report the biochemical, functional, and structural characterization of a 130-amino-acid protein, Y3, from the mushroom Coprinus comatus Biochemical studies of recombinant Y3 from a yeast expression system demonstrated the protein is a unique GBP. Additionally, we show that Y3 exhibits selective and potent cytotoxicity toward human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells compared with a panel of cancer cell lines via inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis. Screening of a glycan array demonstrated GalNAcbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc (LDNF) as a specific Y3-binding ligand. To provide a structural basis for function, the crystal structure was solved to a resolution of 1.2 A, revealing a single-domain alphabetaalpha-sandwich motif. Two monomers were dimerized to form a large 10-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices on each side, representing a unique oligomerization mode among GBPs. A large glycan binding pocket extends into the dimeric interface, and docking of LDNF identified key residues for glycan interactions. Disruption of residues predicted to be involved in LDNF/Y3 interactions resulted in the significant loss of binding to Jurkat T-cells and severely impaired their cytotoxicity. Collectively, these results demonstrate Y3 to be a GBP with selective cytotoxicity toward human T-cell leukemia cells and indicate its potential use in cancer diagnosis and treatment.","['Zhang, Peilan', 'Li, Kunhua', 'Yang, Guang', 'Xia, Changqing', 'Polston, Jane E', 'Li, Gengnan', 'Li, Shiwu', 'Lin, Zhao', 'Yang, Li-Jun', 'Bruner, Steven D', 'Ding, Yousong']","['Zhang P', 'Li K', 'Yang G', 'Xia C', 'Polston JE', 'Li G', 'Li S', 'Lin Z', 'Yang LJ', 'Bruner SD', 'Ding Y']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Center for Natural Products, Drug Discovery and Development, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Center for Natural Products, Drug Discovery and Development, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Plant Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Periodontics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611; bruner@chem.ufl.edu YDing@cop.ufl.edu.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Center for Natural Products, Drug Discovery and Development, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610; bruner@chem.ufl.edu YDing@cop.ufl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170807,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)']",IM,"['Agaricales/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coprinus/*metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Models, Molecular', 'Polysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Coprinus comatus', '*LDNF', '*crystal structure', '*cytotoxicity', '*glycan binding protein']",2017/08/09 06:00,2018/06/02 06:00,['2017/08/09 06:00'],"['2017/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['1706894114 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1706894114 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Aug 22;114(34):8980-8985. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1706894114.

Large-scale sequencing efforts have uncovered a spectrum of mutations in many hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that combinations of agents will be required to treat these diseases effectively. Combinatorial approaches will also be critical for combating the emergence of genetically heterogeneous subclones, rescue signals in the microenvironment, and tumor-intrinsic feedback pathways that all contribute to disease relapse. To identify novel and effective drug combinations, we performed ex vivo sensitivity profiling of 122 primary patient samples from a variety of hematologic malignancies against a panel of 48 drug combinations. The combinations were designed as drug pairs that target nonoverlapping biological pathways and comprise drugs from different classes, preferably with Food and Drug Administration approval. A combination ratio (CR) was derived for each drug pair, and CRs were evaluated with respect to diagnostic categories as well as against genetic, cytogenetic, and cellular phenotypes of specimens from the two largest disease categories: AML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nearly all tested combinations involving a BCL2 inhibitor showed additional benefit in patients with myeloid malignancies, whereas select combinations involving PI3K, CSF1R, or bromodomain inhibitors showed preferential benefit in lymphoid malignancies. Expanded analyses of patients with AML and CLL revealed specific patterns of ex vivo drug combination efficacy that were associated with select genetic, cytogenetic, and phenotypic disease subsets, warranting further evaluation. These findings highlight the heuristic value of an integrated functional genomic approach to the identification of novel treatment strategies for hematologic malignancies.","['Kurtz, Stephen E', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Kaempf, Andy', 'Khanna, Vishesh', 'Savage, Samantha L', 'Rofelty, Angela', 'English, Isabel', 'Ho, Hibery', 'Pandya, Ravi', 'Bolosky, William J', 'Poon, Hoifung', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Collins, Robert', 'Swords, Ronan T', 'Watts, Justin', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Traer, Elie', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Mori, Motomi', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W']","['Kurtz SE', 'Eide CA', 'Kaempf A', 'Khanna V', 'Savage SL', 'Rofelty A', 'English I', 'Ho H', 'Pandya R', 'Bolosky WJ', 'Poon H', 'Deininger MW', 'Collins R', 'Swords RT', 'Watts J', 'Pollyea DA', 'Medeiros BC', 'Traer E', 'Tognon CE', 'Mori M', 'Druker BJ', 'Tyner JW']","['Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA 98052.', 'Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA 98052.', 'Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA 98052.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.', 'UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390.', 'University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136.', 'University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Oregon Health & Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239; drukerb@ohsu.edu tynerj@ohsu.edu.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Cell, Development & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239 drukerb@ohsu.edu tynerj@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170807,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*drug combinations', '*ex vivo assay', '*hematologic malignancies', '*targeted therapies']",2017/08/09 06:00,2018/05/26 06:00,['2017/08/09 06:00'],"['2017/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['1703094114 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1703094114 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Sep 5;114(36):E7554-E7563. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1703094114.

The E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 catalyzes the conjugation of SUMOs to -amino groups of lysine residues in target proteins. Attachment of SUMO moieties to internal lysines in Ubc9 itself can further lead to the formation of polymeric SUMO chains. Mono- and poly-SUMOylations of target proteins provide docking sites for distinct adapter and effector proteins important for regulating discrete SUMO-regulated pathways. However, molecular tools to dissect pathways depending on either mono- or poly-SUMOylation are largely missing. Using a protein-engineering approach, we generated high-affinity SUMO2 variants by phage display that bind the back side binding site of Ubc9 and function as SUMO-based Ubc9 inhibitors (SUBINs). Importantly, we found that distinct SUBINs primarily inhibit poly-SUMO chain formation, whereas mono-SUMOylation was not impaired. Proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated that in a cellular context, SUBINs largely prevent heat shock-triggered poly-SUMOylation. Moreover, SUBINs abrogated arsenic-induced degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein. We propose that the availability of the new chain-selective SUMO inhibitors reported here will enable a thorough investigation of poly-SUMO-mediated cellular processes, such as DNA damage responses and cell cycle progression.","['Wiechmann, Svenja', 'Gartner, Anne', 'Kniss, Andreas', 'Stengl, Andreas', 'Behrends, Christian', 'Rogov, Vladimir V', 'Rodriguez, Manuel S', 'Dotsch, Volker', 'Muller, Stefan', 'Ernst, Andreas']","['Wiechmann S', 'Gartner A', 'Kniss A', 'Stengl A', 'Behrends C', 'Rogov VV', 'Rodriguez MS', 'Dotsch V', 'Muller S', 'Ernst A']","['From the Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University School of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University School of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Biophysical Chemistry and Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance, Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University School of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University School of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Biophysical Chemistry and Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance, Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institut des Technologies Avancees en Sciences du Vivant-UPS and IPBS-CNRS, 1 Place Pierre Potier Oncopole entree B, BP 50624, 31106 Toulouse Cedex 1, France.', 'Institute of Biophysical Chemistry and Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance, Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University School of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany, ste.mueller@em.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University School of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany, a.ernst@em.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Project Group Translational Medicine and Pharmacology TMP, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170807,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Arsenic/toxicity', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Library', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Ligands', '*Models, Molecular', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'RNA Interference', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Sumoylation/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PML', '*UBC9', '*enzyme inhibitor', '*heat shock', '*nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)', '*phage display', '*protein engineering', '*small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)', '*sumoylation']",2017/08/09 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/08/09 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)34083-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M117.794255 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Sep 15;292(37):15340-15351. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M117.794255.

However, its safety and efficacy in preventing acute GVHD in settings of heightened clinical risk that use myeloablative conditioning, unrelated donor (URD), and methotrexate are not known. We conducted a prospective, phase 2 study in this higher-risk setting. We enrolled 37 patients to provide 80% power to detect a significant difference in grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD of 50% compared with a reduction in target to 28%. Eligibility included adults with a hematological malignancy to receive myeloablative HCT from an available 8/8-HLA matched URD. Patients received GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and methotrexate. Vorinostat (100 mg twice daily) was started on day -10 and continued through day +100 post-HCT. Median age was 56 years (range, 18-69 years), and 95% had acute myelogenous leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Vorinostat was safe and tolerable. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD at day 100 was 22%, and for grade 3 to 4 it was 8%. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 29%; relapse, nonrelapse mortality, GVHD-free relapse-free survival, and overall survival at 1 year were 19%, 16%, 47%, and 76%, respectively. Correlative analyses showed enhanced histone (H3) acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reduced interleukin 6 (P = .028) and GVHD biomarkers (Reg3, P = .041; ST2, P = .002) at day 30 post-HCT in vorinostat-treated subjects compared with similarly treated patients who did not receive vorinostat. Vorinostat for GVHD prevention is an effective strategy that should be confirmed in a randomized phase 3 study.

End-of-life care is particularly relevant for older adults with AML because of their poor prognosis. Methods We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of patients with AML who were >/= 66 years of age at diagnosis and diagnosed during the period from 1999 to 2011 and died before December 31, 2012. Medicare claims were used to assess patterns of hospice care and use of aggressive treatment. Predictors of these end points were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results In the overall cohort (N = 13,156), hospice care after AML diagnosis increased from 31.3% in 1999 to 56.4% in 2012, but the increase was primarily driven by late hospice enrollment that occurred in the last 7 days of life. Among the 5,847 patients who enrolled in hospice, 47.4% and 28.8% started their first hospice enrollment in the last 7 and 3 days of life, respectively. Among patients who transferred in and out of hospice care, 62% received transfusions outside hospice. Additionally, the use of chemotherapy within the last 14 days of life increased from 7.7% in 1999 to 18.8% in 2012. Patients who were male and nonwhite were less likely to enroll in hospice and more likely to receive chemotherapy or be admitted to intensive care units at the end of life. Conversely, older patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy or have intensive care unit admission at the end of life, and were more likely to enroll in hospice. Conclusion End-of-life care for older patients with AML is suboptimal. Additional research is warranted to identify reasons for their low use of hospice services and strategies to enhance end-of-life care for these patients.","['Wang, Rong', 'Zeidan, Amer M', 'Halene, Stephanie', 'Xu, Xiao', 'Davidoff, Amy J', 'Huntington, Scott F', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai A', 'Gross, Cary P', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Ma, Xiaomei']","['Wang R', 'Zeidan AM', 'Halene S', 'Xu X', 'Davidoff AJ', 'Huntington SF', 'Podoltsev NA', 'Gross CP', 'Gore SD', 'Ma X']","['Rong Wang, Amy J.

Mate Value Among Young Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer and Healthy Peers.,72-78,10.1089/jayao.2017.0041 [doi],"PURPOSE: This study focused on self-perceived mate value of young adult survivors of childhood cancer relative to healthy peers. Qualitative studies indicate potential problems surrounding romantic relationships among survivors, but systematic studies are missing. METHODS: One-hundred forty-nine childhood cancer survivors and 149 matched controls completed online questionnaires about their mate value, social comparison strategies (i.e., upward/downward identifying/contrasting strategies), and marital status. Survivors and controls were aged 20-40 (M = 27.8), 55% were female, and survivors had been treated for brain tumors (n = 52; 35%), leukemia (n = 42; 28%), lymphoma (n = 31; 21%), or other solid tumors (n = 24; 16%) at 5-33 years before study participation. RESULTS: Survivors and controls did not differ on overall mate value, but on individual characteristics: Survivors thought they had a better sense of humor (d = 0.36), were more loyal (d = 0.32), had higher social status (d = 0.26), and were more ambitious (d = 0.19), while also considering themselves less sexually adventurous (d = 0.31), less healthy (d = 0.26), having less desire to have children (d = 0.21), and a less attractive face (d = 0.20). Higher mate value was related to being partnered, more upward-identifying, less upward-contrasting, and less downward-identifying strategies. Moreover, less downward-identifying was associated with higher mate value in survivors, but not controls; whereas greater downward-contrasting was associated with higher mate value among controls only (R(2) = 30.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors do not generally view themselves as less valuable (potential) romantic partners, but they evaluate different characteristics either more positively or more negatively. Social comparison strategies offer targetable points of interventions to intervene on negative self-evaluations, potentially enhancing well-being.","['Lehmann, Vicky', 'Tuinman, Marrit A', 'Keim, Madelaine C', 'Hagedoorn, Mariet', 'Gerhardt, Cynthia A']","['Lehmann V', 'Tuinman MA', 'Keim MC', 'Hagedoorn M', 'Gerhardt CA']","[""1 The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital , Center for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus, Ohio."", '2 Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University , Columbus, Ohio.', '3 University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)/University of Groningen , Healthy Psychology Research Section, Groningen, The Netherlands .', ""1 The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital , Center for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus, Ohio."", '3 University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)/University of Groningen , Healthy Psychology Research Section, Groningen, The Netherlands .', ""1 The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital , Center for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus, Ohio."", '2 Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University , Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170807,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adult survivors of childhood cancer', '*marital status', '*mate value', '*romantic relationships', '*self-perception', '*social comparison strategies']",2017/08/08 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2017.0041 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2018 Feb;7(1):72-78. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2017.0041.

Defective autophagy is associated with tumorigenesis and has a causative role in chemotherapy resistance in leukemia and in solid cancers. Here, we report that autophagy is regulated by the lysine-specific demethylase LSD1/KDM1A, an epigenetic marker whose overexpression is a feature of malignant neoplasia with an instrumental role in cancer development. In the present study, we determine that two different LSD1 inhibitors (TCP and SP2509) as well as selective ablation of LSD1 expression promote autophagy in neuroblastoma cells. At a mechanistic level, we show that LSD1 binds to the promoter region of Sestrin2 (SESN2), a critical regulator of mTORC1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 triggers SESN2 expression that hampers mTORC1 activity, leading to enhanced autophagy. SESN2 overexpression suffices to promote autophagy in neuroblastoma cells, while loss of SESN2 expression reduces autophagy induced by LSD1 inhibition. Our findings elucidate a mechanism whereby LSD1 controls autophagy in neuroblastoma cells through SESN2 transcription regulation, and we suggest that pharmacological targeting of LSD1 may have effective therapeutic relevance in the control of autophagy in neuroblastoma.","['Ambrosio, S', 'Sacca, C D', 'Amente, S', 'Paladino, S', 'Lania, L', 'Majello, B']","['Ambrosio S', 'Sacca CD', 'Amente S', 'Paladino S', 'Lania L', 'Majello B']","[""Division of Genetics, Department of Biology, University of Naples, 'Federico II', Naples, Italy."", ""Division of Genetics, Department of Biology, University of Naples, 'Federico II', Naples, Italy."", ""Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, University of Naples, 'Federico II', Naples, Italy."", ""Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, University of Naples, 'Federico II', Naples, Italy."", 'Ceinge Biotecnologie Avanzate s.c.a.r.l., Naples, Italy.', ""Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, University of Naples, 'Federico II', Naples, Italy."", ""Division of Genetics, Department of Biology, University of Naples, 'Federico II', Naples, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170807,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SESN2 protein, human)', '0 (TFEB protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)']",IM,"['*Autophagy', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Demethylases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/*enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2017/08/08 06:00,2017/12/08 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2017267 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2017.267 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Nov 30;36(48):6701-6711. doi: 10.1038/onc.2017.267.

The Emu-TCL1 transgenic mouse develops a form of leukemia that is similar to the aggressive type of human B-CLL, and this valuable model has been widely used for testing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we adopted this model to investigate the potential effects of miR-26a, miR-130an and antimiR-155 in CLL therapy. Improved delivery of miRNA molecules into CLL cells was obtained by developing a novel system based on lipid nanoparticles conjugated with an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. This methodology has proven to be highly effective in delivering miRNA molecules into leukemic cells. Short- and long-term experiments showed that miR-26a, miR-130a and anti-miR-155 increased apoptosis after in vitro and in vivo treatment. Of this miRNA panel, miR-26a was the most effective in reducing leukemic cell expansion. Following long-term treatment, apoptosis was readily detectable by analyzing cleavage of PARP and caspase-7. These effects could be directly attributed to miR-26a, as confirmed by significant downregulation of its proven targets, namely cyclin-dependent kinase 6 and Mcl1. The results of this study are relevant to two distinct areas. The first is related to the design of a technical strategy and to the selection of CD38 as a molecular target on CLL cells, both consenting efficient and specific intracellular transfer of miRNA. The original scientific finding inferred from the above approach is that miR-26a can elicit in vivo anti-leukemic activities mediated by increased apoptosis.","[""D'Abundo, L"", 'Callegari, E', 'Bresin, A', 'Chillemi, A', 'Elamin, B K', 'Guerriero, P', 'Huang, X', 'Saccenti, E', 'Hussein, E M A A', 'Casciano, F', 'Secchiero, P', 'Zauli, G', 'Calin, G A', 'Russo, G', 'Lee, L J', 'Croce, C M', 'Marcucci, G', 'Sabbioni, S', 'Malavasi, F', 'Negrini, M']","[""D'Abundo L"", 'Callegari E', 'Bresin A', 'Chillemi A', 'Elamin BK', 'Guerriero P', 'Huang X', 'Saccenti E', 'Hussein EMAA', 'Casciano F', 'Secchiero P', 'Zauli G', 'Calin GA', 'Russo G', 'Lee LJ', 'Croce CM', 'Marcucci G', 'Sabbioni S', 'Malavasi F', 'Negrini M']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', ""Laboratorio di Oncologia Molecolare, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Immunologia dei Trapianti, Citta della Salute e della Scienza, Torino, Italy.', 'Microbiology Department, Faculty of Medical laboratory Sciences, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Microbiology Department, College of Medicine, University of Bisha, Bisha, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, University Hospital Arcispedale S.

The disease typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair apoptosis of clonal B cells. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen and B-cell markers. PROGNOSIS: Two prognostic staging systems exist, the Rai and Binet staging systems, which are established by physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene predict resistance to available chemotherapies. A comprehensive prognostic score (CLL-IPI) using genetic, biological, and clinical variables has recently been developed allowing to classify CLL into very distinct risk groups. THERAPY: Patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. For physically fit patients, chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the current standard therapy. For unfit patients, currently available evidence supports two options for a first-line therapy: chlorambucil combined with an anti-CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab or rituximab or ofatumumab) or a continuous therapy with ibrutinib. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated, if the treatment-free interval exceeds 3 years. If the disease relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using alternative agents such as bendamustine (plus rituximab), alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, ofatumumab, ibrutinib, idelalisib, or venetoclax. Patients with a del(17p) or TP53 mutation can be treated with ibrutinib, venetoclax, or a combination of idelalisib and rituximab. An allogeneic SCT may be considered in relapsing patients with TP53 mutations or del(17p) or patients that are refractory to chemoimmunotherapy and the novel inhibitors. FUTURE CHALLENGES: The new agents (ibrutinib, idelalisib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab) hold the potential to significantly improve the outcome of CLL patients. However, their optimal use (in terms of combination, sequence, and duration) remains unknown. Therefore, CLL patients should be treated in clinical trials whenever possible.","['Hallek, Michael']",['Hallek M'],"['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Koln Bonn, Center of Excellence on ""Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases,"" University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, Koln, 50937, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)', 'Chromosome 17 deletion']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', '*Smith-Magenis Syndrome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2017/08/08 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24826 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Sep;92(9):946-965. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24826.,,"['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TLCs are threatened by various infectious diseases. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) causes a serious infectious disease with a poor prognosis in cats. Therefore, the transmission of FeLV from Tsushima domestic cats (TDCs) to TLCs may threaten the TLC population. We investigated the FeLV infection status of both TDCs and TLCs on Tsushima Island by screening blood samples for FeLV p27 antigen and using PCR to amplify the full-length FeLV env gene. The prevalence of FeLV was 6.4% in TDCs and 0% in TLCs. We also demonstrated that the virus can replicate in the cells of TLCs, suggesting its potential cross-species transmission. The viruses in TDCs were classified as genotype I/clade 3, which is prevalent on a nearby island, based on previous studies of FeLV genotypes and FeLV epidemiology. The FeLV viruses identified on Tsushima Island can be further divided into 2 lineages within genotype I/clade 3, which are geographically separated in Kamijima and Shimojima, indicating that FeLV may have been transmitted to Tsushima Island at least twice. Monitoring FeLV infection in the TDC and TLC populations is highly recommended as part of the TLC surveillance and management strategy.","['Makundi, Isaac', 'Koshida, Yushi', 'Kuse, Kyohei',

We conducted a retrospective review of a single-institution database including patients with AML who received allo-HSCT following conditioning with Mel/Flu or Bu/Cy-based regimens. We performed descriptive statistical analysis to examine patient demographics and clinical outcomes. We identified 156 patients meeting criteria between 2005 and 2014. Overall, patients conditioned with Bu/Cy were significantly younger, but more likely to be treated in an earlier era than those receiving Flu/Mel. Regimen choice was not associated with relapse rates (RR), relapse-free survival (RFS), or overall survival (OS) on both univariate and multivariable analyses. Bu/Cy was associated with increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) on multivariable analysis. These findings demonstrate that Flu/Mel provides non-inferior disease control and could be an appropriate regimen for selected patients.","['Dhere, Vishal', 'Edelman, Scott', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Langston, Amelia', 'Graiser, Michael', 'Connolly, Erin C', 'Switchenko, Jeffrey M', 'Esiashvili, Natia', 'Khan, Mohammad K']","['Dhere V', 'Edelman S', 'Waller EK', 'Langston A', 'Graiser M', 'Connolly EC', 'Switchenko JM', 'Esiashvili N', 'Khan MK']","['a Department of Radiation Oncology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'a Department of Radiation Oncology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'a Department of Radiation Oncology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics , Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'a Department of Radiation Oncology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'a Department of Radiation Oncology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , GA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170807,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Patient Selection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Transplant toxicity', '*chemotherapeutic approaches', '*myeloid leukemias and dysplasias']",2017/08/08 06:00,2019/01/27 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1361027 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Apr;59(4):837-843. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1361027.

We examined the role of various long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-homeobox protein HOXA13 axis on the switching of the oncogenic function of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), which is significantly lost in the gastric cancer cell derived iPS-like cells (iPSLCs). BMP7 promoter activation occurred through the corecruitment of HOXA13, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 lysine N-methyltransferase, WD repeat-containing protein 5, and lncRNA HoxA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) to commit the epigenetic changes to the trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 in cancer cells. By contrast, HOXA13 inhibited BMP7 expression in iPSLCs via the corecruitment of HOXA13, enhancer of zeste homolog 2, Jumonji and AT rich interactive domain 2, and lncRNA HoxA transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) to various cis-element of the BMP7 promoter. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that HOTTIP contributed positively, but HOTAIR regulated negatively to HOXA13-mediated BMP7 expression in cancer cells and iPSLCs, respectively. These findings indicate that the recruitment of HOXA13-HOTTIP and HOXA13-HOTAIR to different sites in the BMP7 promoter is crucial for the oncogenic fate of human gastric cells. Reprogramming with octamer-binding protein 4 and Jun dimerization protein 2 can inhibit tumorigenesis by switching off BMP7.

To assist in selecting patients who are likely to benefit from splenectomy, we looked into risk factors for postsplenectomy survival, in 120 consecutive cases (median age 66 years); at the time of splenectomy, 61% displayed red cell transfusion need, 49% platelet count <100 x 10(9)/L, 25% leukocyte count >25 x 10(9)/L, 60% constitutional symptoms and 13% circulating blasts >/=5%; dynamic international prognostic scoring system risk categories were 21% high, 55% intermediate-2, 21% intermediate-1 and 3% low. Among informative cases, karyotype was abnormal in 60% and driver mutational status was JAK2 75%, CALR 15%, MPL 4% and triple-negative 6%. At median follow-up of 1.3 years, from time of splenectomy, 95 (79%) deaths and 30 (25%) leukemic transformations were recorded. Median postsplenectomy survival was 1.5 years; in multivariable analysis, survival was adversely affected by age >65 years, transfusion need, leukocyte count >25 x 10(9)/L and circulating blasts >/=5%; these variables were subsequently used to devise an HR-weighted scoring system with high (3-4 risk factors), intermediate (2 risk factors) and low (0-1 risk factors) risk categories; the corresponding postsplenectomy median survivals were 0.3 (HR 5.9, 95% CI 3.2-11.0), 1.3 (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.6) and 2.9 years. Postsplenectomy survival was not affected by driver mutational status or occurrence of leukemic transformation. Leukemia-free survival was predicted by very high risk karyotype. The observations from the current study might help identify appropriate candidates for splenectomy in MF.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Mudireddy, Mythri', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Nagorney, David M']","['Tefferi A', 'Mudireddy M', 'Gangat N', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Pardanani A', 'Nagorney DM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of, Laboratory Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of, Laboratory Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of, Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170824,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*mortality/surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenectomy', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2017/08/07 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24881 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Nov;92(11):1187-1192. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24881.

However, there are few reports concerning adverse drug reactions (ADRs) resulting from concomitant use of vindesine (VDS) and itraconazole. Here, we report the first case of adverse drug interactions (ADIs) between itraconazole and VDS in a Chinese child with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL). CASE SUMMARY: A 4-year-old boy was diagnosed with standard-risk ALL and was receiving VDS (3 mg/m(2) ) for maintenance therapy and itraconazole for IFI recurrence. Severe neurotoxicity, consisting mainly of trismus and SIADH, was noticed after 7 days of VDS administration. After discontinuation of itraconazole and its replacement with caspofungin, the patient recovered from neurological signs and symptoms. The ADIs can be explained by VDS accumulation owing to inherent loss of CYP3A5 (*3/*3) function, and inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by itraconazole. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone from co-administration of itraconazole and VDS has not previously been reported to our knowledge. We suggest that the concomitant use of these drugs should be avoided if possible. The use of alternative antifungal drugs (AFDs) should be considered, and ADRs should be closely monitored when the combination of itraconazole and VDS is unavoidable.","['Zhou, H', 'Li, L', 'Zhou, Y', 'Han, Y']","['Zhou H', 'Li L', 'Zhou Y', 'Han Y']","['Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20170806,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate ADH Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Itraconazole/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Vindesine/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['drug interaction', 'itraconazole', 'syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone', 'vindesine']",2017/08/07 06:00,2018/08/03 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2016/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpt.12598 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2018 Feb;43(1):137-140. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12598.

MLL break-apart signals were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and transcriptome sequencing revealed MLL-myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated To, 10 (MLLT10)/AF10 fusion transcripts. Analysis also revealed a previously unreported MLLT10/AF10-homeobox protein Mohawk (MKX) transcript, where the 5' portion of MLLT10/AF10 at 10p12.31 was fused out-of-frame with the 3' portion of MKX at 10p12.1, which is closely located to MLLT10/AF10. Furthermore, the reciprocal 3'-MLL gene segment was fused in-frame to AT-rich interaction domain (ARID)5B at 10q21. Previously, common allelic variants in ARID5B, which are directly associated with hematopoietic differentiation and development, have been repeatedly and significantly associated with childhood ALL. The heterozygous genotype in ARID5B (RefSNP: rs10821936) increased the risk for leukemia with MLL-rearrangement. In particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms of ARID5B conferred increased risk for MLL-MLLT3/AF9. Based on these findings, the authors propose that while the presence of reciprocal MLL alleles has been detected in this patient, different pathological disease mechanisms may be at play due to individual recombination events.","['Hiwatari, Mitsuteru', 'Seki, Masafumi', 'Akahoshi, Shogo', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Tanaka, Hiroko', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Takita, Junko']","['Hiwatari M', 'Seki M', 'Akahoshi S', 'Yoshida K', 'Miyano S', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Tanaka H', 'Chiba K', 'Ogawa S', 'Takita J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Sequence Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Sequence Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170620,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ARID5B', 'MLL-MLLT10/AF10', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'molecular biology', 'transcriptome sequencing']",2017/08/07 06:00,2017/08/07 06:01,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2017.6430 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-6430 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2017 Aug;14(2):2295-2299. doi: 10.3892/ol.2017.6430.

Two previous large surveys assessed the frequency of DCL; the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation identified 14 DCL cases from 10,489 allo-SCTs, and the University of Minnesota reported eight cases from 2,390 engrafted allo-SCTs. Recently, a Japanese survey identified 40 DCL cases from 36,870 allo-SCTs, and the incidence of DCL was estimated as 0.16% at 15 years. Through these analyses, cord blood was considered as a risk factor for DCL development compared to other stem cell sources, and it should also be noted that donor age was positively correlated with DCL incidence. Further molecular and immunological investigations would clarify the pathogenesis of DCL and may provide additional clues for understanding the underlying mechanisms of typical hematological malignancies.","['Kato, Motohiro']",['Kato M'],"[""Department of Transplantation and Cell Therapy, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development.""]",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Donor cell-derived', '*Secondary malignancy']",2017/08/07 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.813 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(7):813-817. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.813.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the rearranged allele, we found that the GATA2 gene enhancer on 3q21 localizes in close proximity to the EVI1 gene. To examine the contribution of the GATA2 gene enhancer upon the abnormal expression of EVI1 and leukemogenesis, we established a leukemia mouse model (3q21q26 mouse) harboring a transgene recapitulating a 196-kb inverted allele between 3q21 and 3q26 by linking two bacterial artificial chromosome clones. The 3q21q26 mice demonstrated high EVI1 transgene expression specifically in hematopoietic progenitors and developed leukemia after 6 months of age. Of note, by deleting the GATA2 enhancer, EVI1 transgene expression and leukemogenesis were significantly suppressed, indicating that the GATA2 enhancer drives the abnormal expression of EVI1 in the rearranged allele and induces leukemogenesis. While the EVI1 gene gains the GATA2 enhancer, GATA2 gene loses its enhancer. Therefore, GATA2 expression levels are reduced in leukemic cells with such chromosomal rearrangements. To examine the contribution of GATA2 heterozygous deletion upon leukemogenesis, we crossed the 3q21q26 mice with Gata2 heterozygous knockout mice to generate compound mutant mice recapitulating both abnormal EVI1 expression and Gata2 heterozygous deletion. The compound mutant mice developed leukemia earlier than the 3q21q26 mice did. These results indicate that GATA2 heterozygous deletion accelerates leukemogenesis driven by the abnormal expression of EVI1.","['Suzuki, Mikiko']",['Suzuki M'],"['Center for Radioisotope Sciences, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*3q21q26 syndrome', '*EVI1', '*GATA2', '*Leukemia']",2017/08/07 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.806 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(7):806-812. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.806.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, these cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells via a common progenitor population. We have been investigating the mechanism underlying the development of mononuclear phagocytes from the viewpoint of gene expression control by transcription factors. Particularly, IRF8, the loss of which causes immunodeficiency and chronic myeloid leukemia-like neutrophilia in mice and humans, promotes the development of monocytes and DCs, while it limits neutrophil differentiation. IRF8 cooperates with the myeloid master transcription factor, PU.1, in mononuclear phagocyte progenitors. KLF4 and BATF3 serve as critical transcription factors downstream of IRF8 to induce the differentiation of monocytes and DCs, respectively. Conversely, IRF8 blocks the activity of the transcription factor C/EBPalpha to suppress the neutrophil differentiation program. Indeed, Irf8(-/-) mononuclear phagocyte progenitors do not efficiently generate monocytes and DCs and, instead, aberrantly give rise to a large number of neutrophils. Our recent data have begun to uncover the vital role of IRF8 in the establishment of distal enhancers in mononuclear phagocyte progenitors. These results place IRF8 as a central regulator of the development of monocytes and DCs.","['Tamura, Tomohiko']",['Tamura T'],"['Department of Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/*cytology/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetics', '*IRF8', '*Mononuclear phagocyte differentiation', '*Transcription factors']",2017/08/07 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.798 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(7):798-805. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.798.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The administration of ruxolitinib prior to transplantation may have contributed to engraftment with a non-invasive reduction in the size of the spleen.","['Fujishima, Masumi', 'Fujishima, Naohito', 'Kitadate, Akihiro', 'Guo, Yongmei', 'Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Ubukawa, Kumi', 'Nara, Miho', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Takahashi, Naoto']","['Fujishima M', 'Fujishima N', 'Kitadate A', 'Guo Y', 'Watanabe A', 'Ubukawa K', 'Nara M', 'Yoshioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Takahashi N']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",IM,"['Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Splenomegaly/*drug therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis', '*Ruxolitinib', '*Splenomegaly']",2017/08/07 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2017/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.743 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(7):743-748. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, Bartonella DNA was detected in 4.6% (80/1754) of the cats examined. The nested-PCR showed that 48.8% (39/80) of the positive cats were infected with B. henselae mono-infection, 33.8% (27/80) with B. clarridgeiae mono-infection and 17.5% (14/80) were infected with both species.

However, the role of CD31 in uterine receptivity during blastocyst implantation is poorly understood. The pregnancy rate in CD31(-/-) female mice mated with CD31(+/+) male mice was higher than that observed in CD31(+/+) female mice mated with CD31(+/+) male mice. During the receptive phase of implantation, uterine glands were more developed in CD31(-/-) mice than in CD31(+/+) mice, and the uterine weights of CD31(-/-) mice were increased. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was highly expressed in the CD31(-/-) mice during implantation and the expression of LIF was up-regulated by estradiol-17beta (E2 ) + progesterone (P4 ) in ovariectomized CD31(-/-) mice, compared with CD31(+/+) mice at 8 h after hormone treatment. E2 -induced protein synthesis was inhibited by P4 in the CD31(+/+) uterus, but not in the uterus of CD31(-/-) mice. Also, STAT3, HAND2, LIF, and mTOR signals were enhanced in CD31(-/-) mice. Stromal DNA replication was highly activated in the uterus of CD31(-/-) mice, manifested by upregulated cyclin series signaling and PCNA expression after E2 + P4 treatment. Collectively, CD31 inhibits E2 -mediated epithelial proliferation via recruitment and phosphorylation of SHP-2 upon receiving P4 signal in early pregnancy.","['Lee, Seo-Ho', 'Kim, Byung-Ju', 'Kim, Uh-Hyun']","['Lee SH', 'Kim BJ', 'Kim UH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Laboratory for CaSignaling Network, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Laboratory for CaSignaling Network, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Laboratory for CaSignaling Network, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170805,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects/genetics', 'Endometrium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Uterus/drug effects/*metabolism']",,,2017/08/07 06:00,2018/06/13 06:00,['2017/08/07 06:00'],"['2017/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['REP-17-0419 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-17-0419 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2017 Nov;154(5):595-605. doi: 10.1530/REP-17-0419.

B cells express CD1d, however, we show that CD1d expression is reduced on B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). B cells from CLL patients pulsed with alpha-GalCer failed to stimulate cytolytic degranulation by iNKT cell lines, but could present the more potent glycolipid analogue, 7DW8-5. Retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) agonists induced CD1d expression by CLL B cells, restoring their ability to present alpha-GalCer to CD8alpha(+) iNKT cells, resulting in cytolytic degranulation. Thus, RAR-alpha agonists can augment the anti-tumor activities of iNKT cells against CLL cells in vitro.

However, the availability of an increasing number of targeted agents and combination warrants a reassessment of that approach. The high rate of durable responses with ibrutinib in relapsed refractory patients has established its role in this setting; however, because of its impressive efficacy as initial treatment, it should be considered as part of the algorithm in appropriate patients. There is virtually no role for chemotherapy in the relapsed or refractory setting, but, instead, consideration of active agents including idelalisib plus rituximab, or, particularly venetoclax. For patients with 17p-deletion, ibrutinib is the treatment of choice, with venetoclax in the setting of intolerance or relapse. Challenges include developing strategies to limit the duration of these expensive therapies, and to develop combinations with the potential to cure patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Cheson, Bruce D']",['Cheson BD'],"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC.

In the present study, we evaluated the role of S14161 in autophagy, an emerging event in cell destination. Multiple myeloma cell lines RPMI-8226, OPM2, KMS11 and leukemia cell line K562 were treated with S14161. The results showed that S14161 induced autophagy as demonstrated by increased LC3-II and decreased p62, which were prevented by autophagy inhibitors including 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1. Mechanistic studies showed that S14161 had no effects on Vps34 expression, but increased Beclin 1 and decreased Bcl-2, two major regulators of autophagy. Furthermore, S14161 dissociated the Beclin 1/Bcl-2 complex and enhanced the formation of Beclin 1/Vps34 complex. Moreover, S14161 inhibited the mTORC1 signaling transduction. S14161 downregulated activation of mTOR and its two critical targets 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, suggesting S14161 inhibited protein synthesis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Class I PI3K regulates autophagy by modulating protein synthesis and the Beclin 1 signaling pathway. This finding helps understanding the roles of PI3K in autophagy and cancer treatment.","['Wang, Siyu', 'Li, Jie', 'Du, Yanyun', 'Xu, Yujia', 'Wang, Yali', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Xu, Zhuan', 'Zeng, Yuanying', 'Mao, Xinliang', 'Cao, Biyin']","['Wang S', 'Li J', 'Du Y', 'Xu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Xu Z', 'Zeng Y', 'Mao X', 'Cao B']","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Department of Oncology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital East Campus, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Preventive and Translational Medicine for Geriatric Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.

Ponatinib, blinatumomab, chemotherapy and transplant are the currently available options in these cases. CASE PRESENTATION: We here report the case of a young Ph+ ALL patient who relapsed on front-line dasatinib therapy because of two independent T315I-positive subclones, resulting from different nucleotide substitutions -one of whom never reported previously- and where additional mutant clones outgrew and persisted despite ponatinib, transplant, blinatumomab and conventional chemotherapy. Deep Sequencing (DS) was used to dissect the complexity of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutation status and follow the kinetics of different mutant clones across the sequential therapeutic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This case presents several peculiar and remarkable aspects: i) distinct clones may acquire the same amino acid substitution via different nucleotide changes; ii) the T315I mutation may arise also from an 'act' to 'atc' codon change; iii) the strategy of temporarily replacing TKI therapy with chemo or immunotherapy, in order to remove the selective pressure and deselect aggressive mutant clones, cannot always be expected to be effective; iv) BCR-ABL1-mutated sub-clones may persist at very low levels (undetectable even by Deep Sequencing) for long time and then outcompete BCR-ABL1-unmutated ones becoming dominant even in the absence of any TKI selective pressure.","['De Benedittis, Caterina', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Venturi, Claudia', 'Abbenante, Maria Chiara', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Parisi, Sarah', 'Sartor, Chiara', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Soverini, Simona']","['De Benedittis C', 'Papayannidis C', 'Venturi C', 'Abbenante MC', 'Paolini S', 'Parisi S', 'Sartor C', 'Cavo M', 'Martinelli G', 'Soverini S']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

The purpose of this study was to describe the gait characteristics of children and youth treated for ALL who exhibited CIPN compared to typically developing children and youth using 3D motion analyses and electromyography (EMG). Temporal-spatial, kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from 17 youth (mean age 11.2 (5.7) years) with CIPN and compared to data from 10 typically developing youth. Although the gait of the CIPN group was heterogeneous between and within participants, the CIPN group demonstrated primary deviations attributable to CIPN and secondary deviations, both passive effects and active compensatory mechanisms. They had significantly less peak hip extension, knee flexion in loading, dorsiflexion at initial contact, plantarflexion at pre-swing, and dorsiflexion in swing, shorter step lengths, and lower ankle moments and powers than the comparison participants. EMG data from the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles showed excessive co-activation and atypical firing including out of phase firing of the gastrocnemius in late swing and loading and premature firing of the tibialis anterior in terminal stance. This study, using 3D motion analysis and EMG in youth with CIPN, showed variability in gait suggesting that clinical decision-making should be based on a detailed understanding of individual impairments and associated gait abnormalities.","['Wright, Marilyn J', 'Twose, Donna M', 'Gorter, Jan Willem']","['Wright MJ', 'Twose DM', 'Gorter JW']","[""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada; McMaster University, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Hence, it is critical to obtain correct information about these rearrangements in order to apply proper treatment techniques. To identify abnormal molecular changes in patients with leukemia, we developed a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) protocol and investigated more than 140 gene fusions resulting from variations of 29 prevalent chromosomal rearrangements along with EVI1 and TLX1 oncogenic expression in the presence of optimized primers. The potential of the MRT-PCR method was approved by evaluating the available cell lines as positive control and confirmed by sequencing. Samples from 53 patients afflicted with hematopoiesis malignancies were analyzed. Results revealed at least one chromosomal rearrangement in 69% of acute myeloid leukemia subjects, 64% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia subjects, and 81% of chronic myeloid leukemia subjects, as well as a subject with hypereosinophilic syndrome.

In the literature, only few cases of localized small leiomyosarcoma have been described [2, 3]. These cases might benefit from a minimally invasive approach. Robotic surgery has been claimed to have several advantages over laparoscopy such as enhanced vision and instruments movements which might make more feasible the execution of this type of surgery where partial renal resection is required. METHODS: A 53-year-old female with a medical history of myeloid leukemia and with chronic renal failure (creatinine: 2.6) was referred to our hospital for an incidental finding of right perirenal tumor of almost 3 cm compatible with leiomyosarcoma arising from the right renal vein. RESULTS: The operation was performed using a Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System model Si (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).Robotic ports were placed in a standard configuration for minimally invasive right nephrectomy. The dissection started with the partial mobilization of the right liver and Kocher maneuver. After the identification of the inferior vena cava the tumor was finally localized and dissected. Resection ended with a partial right vein resection and suture. Pathological final exam confirmed the diagnosis with margins free from tumor. CONCLUSIONS: In selected cases, robotic resection of leiomyosarcoma might be a safe and feasible procedure in experienced hands.","['Vicente, E', 'Quijano, Y', 'Duran, H', 'Diaz, E', 'Fabra, I', 'Malave, L', 'Ferri, V', 'Lazzaro, S', 'Kalivaci, D', 'Caruso, R', 'Ielpo, Benedetto']","['Vicente E', 'Quijano Y', 'Duran H', 'Diaz E', 'Fabra I', 'Malave L', 'Ferri V', 'Lazzaro S', 'Kalivaci D', 'Caruso R', 'Ielpo B']","['General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.', 'General Surgery Department, Madrid Norte Sanchinarro San Pablo University Hospital, Calle Ona 10, 28050, Madrid, Spain.

Here we have shown that a new CXCR4 receptor antagonist IgG1 antibody (PF-06747143) binds strongly to AML cell lines and to AML primary cells inhibiting their chemotaxis in response to CXCL12. PF-06747143 also induced cytotoxicity in AML cells via Fc-effector function. To characterize the effects of PF-06747143 on leukemia progression, we used two different patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models: Patient 17(CXCR4-low) and P15(CXCR4-high) models, characterized by relatively low and high CXCR4 expression, respectively. Weekly administration of PF-06747143 to leukemic mice significantly reduced leukemia development in both models. Secondary transplantation of BM cells from PF-06747143-treated or IgG1 control-treated animals showed that leukemic progenitors were also targeted by PF-06747143. Administration of a single dose of PF-06747143 to PDX models induced rapid malignant cell mobilization into the peripheral blood (PB).

We found that transformation of HSC/P to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with increased CDC42 expression and activity in leukemia cells. In a mouse model of AML, the loss of Cdc42 abrogates MLL-AF9-induced AML development. Furthermore, genetic ablation of CDC42 in both murine and human MLL-AF9 (MA9) cells decreased survival and induced differentiation of the clonogenic leukemia-initiating cells. We show that MLL-AF9 leukemia cells maintain cell polarity in the context of elevated Cdc42-guanosine triphosphate activity, similar to nonmalignant, young HSC/Ps. The loss of Cdc42 resulted in a shift to depolarized AML cells that is associated with a decrease in the frequency of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions producing daughter cells capable of self-renewal. Importantly, we demonstrate that inducible CDC42 suppression in primary human AML cells blocks leukemia progression in a xenograft model. Thus, CDC42 loss suppresses AML cell polarity and division asymmetry, and CDC42 constitutes a useful target to alter leukemia-initiating cell fate for differentiation therapy.","['Mizukawa, Benjamin', ""O'Brien, Eric"", 'Moreira, Daniel C', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Hochstetler, Cindy L', 'Duan, Xin', 'Liu, Wei', 'Orr, Emily', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Zheng, Yi']","['Mizukawa B', ""O'Brien E"", 'Moreira DC', 'Wunderlich M', 'Hochstetler CL', 'Duan X', 'Liu W', 'Orr E', 'Grimes HL', 'Mulloy JC', 'Zheng Y']","['Division of Oncology.', 'Division of Oncology.', 'Division of Oncology.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, and.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, and.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, and.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, and.', ""Division of Immunobiology, Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", ""Division of Immunobiology, Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, and.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170804,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Polarity/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dried Blood Spot Testing', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/08/06 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32873-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-12-758458 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Sep 14;130(11):1336-1346. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-12-758458.

However, treatment is not curative, and subsequent treatment at relapse is often required. Rechallenge with a purine analog is commonly implemented despite limited data regarding the efficacy of this approach. We retrospectively analyzed 61 consecutive patients with HCL diagnosed between 1995 and 2013 at Cleveland Clinic. Median follow-up was 72 months (3-193). Cladribine as first-line therapy was administered to 59 patients (97%). Overall response rate (ORR) was 97%, with 78% of patients achieving complete remission (CR). PFS after response was significantly improved for patients who achieved CR compared with those with a partial remission (PR) (5-year PFS 71% vs. 39%, respectively [P = .004]). Of the 19 patients who relapsed, 12 received PNAs as second-line treatment with an ORR (83%) comparable to what these patients had with first-line treatment (ORR 92%). Overall survival of all 61 patients was excellent and superior to that of age-, sex-, and race-matched controls from the general population, possibly due to selection bias. In an analysis of a larger cohort of unselected patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we found that mortality rates for patients with HCL were similar to those of the general population approximately 5 years after diagnosis. These data confirm the excellent prognosis for patients with HCL after first- and second-line PNA therapy.","['Madanat, Yazan F', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Jagadeesh, Deepa', 'Dean, Robert', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Smith, Mitchell R', 'Hill, Brian T']","['Madanat YF', 'Rybicki L', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Jagadeesh D', 'Dean R', 'Pohlman B', 'Kalaycio M', 'Sekeres MA', 'Smith MR', 'Hill BT']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.

Identifying the epigenetic mechanisms that govern these changes and developing therapeutic approaches to modulate them, is a well-established avenue pursued in translational cancer medicine. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) arises clonally when a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires the capacity to produce the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 fusion protein which drives tumor development. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target BCR-ABL1 has been transformative in CML management but it does not lead to cure in the vast majority of patients. Thus novel therapeutic approaches are required and these must target changes to biological pathways that are aberrant in CML - including those that occur when epigenetic mechanisms are altered. These changes may be due to alterations in DNA or histones, their biochemical modifications and requisite 'writer' proteins, or to dysregulation of various types of non-coding RNAs that collectively function as modulators of transcriptional control and DNA integrity. Here, we review the evidence for subverted epigenetic mechanisms in CML and how these impact on a diverse set of biological pathways, on disease progression, prognosis and drug resistance. We will also discuss recent progress towards developing epigenetic therapies that show promise to improve CML patient care and may lead to improved cure rates.","['Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Vetrie, David']","['Koschmieder S', 'Vetrie D']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.

The method comprises a cDNA synthesis reaction from standard RNA with a primer containing a tag of 14 randomized bases and the RT to be tested, PCR using high-fidelity DNA polymerase, and NGS. By comparing the sequence of each read with the reference sequence, mutations were identified. The mutation can be identified to be due to an error introduced by either cDNA synthesis, PCR, or NGS based on whether the sequence reads with the same tag contain the same mutation or not. The error rates in cDNA synthesis with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) RT thermostable variant MM4 or the recently developed 16-tuple variant of family B DNA polymerase with RT activity, RTX, from Thermococcus kodakarensis, were 0.75-1.0 x 10(-4) errors/base, while that in the reaction with the wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT was 2.6 x 10(-4) errors/base. Overall, our method could precisely evaluate the fidelity of various RTs with different reaction conditions in a high-throughput manner without the use of expensive optics and troublesome adaptor ligation.","['Yasukawa, Kiyoshi', 'Iida, Kei', 'Okano, Hiroyuki', 'Hidese, Ryota', 'Baba, Misato', 'Yanagihara, Itaru', 'Kojima, Kenji', 'Takita, Teisuke', 'Fujiwara, Shinsuke']","['Yasukawa K', 'Iida K', 'Okano H', 'Hidese R', 'Baba M', 'Yanagihara I', 'Kojima K', 'Takita T', 'Fujiwara S']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawa, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.

All 4 disorders are characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation with mutually exclusive driver mutations, including JAK2, CALR, and MPL. The median survival is approximately 20 years for ET, 14 years for PV, and 6 years for PMF; age is the most important determinant of survival with the corresponding median of 33, 24, and 15 years in patients younger than 60 years. Genetic information is the second most important prognostic tool and includes karyotype, driver mutational status, and presence of specific other mutations. Karyotype has been shown to carry prognostic relevance in PV (abnormal vs normal) and PMF (unfavorable vs favorable abnormalities). Driver mutational status is prognostically most relevant in PMF; type 1/type 1-like CALR vs other driver mutational status has been associated with superior survival. In ET, arterial thrombosis risk is higher in patients with JAK2 or MPL mutations whereas MPL-mutated patients might be at risk for accelerated fibrotic progression. ASXL1 and SRSF2 mutations have been associated with inferior overall, leukemia-free, or fibrosis-free survival in both PV and PMF, and a recent targeted sequencing study has identified additional other adverse mutations in both these disorders, as well as in ET. Further enhancement of genetic risk stratification in myeloproliferative neoplasms is possible by combining cytogenetic and mutation information and developing a prognostic model that is adjusted for age.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria']","['Tefferi A', 'Vannucchi AM']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

However, immunophenotypic data from adult patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) are scarcely available. METHODS: Subjects were unselected adult patients with T-LBL who were treated with intensive chemotherapy. Immunophenotyping of tumor cells was performed according to standard techniques. RESULTS: A total of eight patients with a median age of 31 years were analyzed who received hyper-CVAD treatment for LBL. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that the most common tumor type was cortical T-cell type [early T (n = 2), cortical T (n = 4), and medullary T (n = 2)]. Two patients diagnosed with early T-cell type had early disease progression.

Excluding well-known socioeconomic issues, genetic markers important for prognosis have not been properly incorporated into the clinical practice so far and their usefulness outside of well-controlled clinical trials remain unknown. METHODS: Here, we assessed the clinical significance of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations in 196 consecutive patients with AML in a real-life setting. All patients were younger than 60 years of age (49% male) and treated with conventional chemotherapy for induction and consolidation in three Brazilian Institutions that well represent Brazilian geographic and socioeconomic diversity. FINDINGS: Multivariable analysis showed that ELN recommendations had a slight association with complete remission achievement (odds ratio: 0.74, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.53-1.01; P=0.06), but were independently associated with poor overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio, HR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.54; P=0.002), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03-1.95; P=0.028) and event-free survival (EFS) (HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.06-1.47; P=0.007), considering initial leukocyte counts and age as confounders. ELN recommendations had no impact on cumulative incidence of relapse (P=0.09). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that within the context of LMIC, the prognostic markers recommended by ELN may be useful to predict patient's clinical outcomes; however, the OS, DFS and EFS were shorter than the reported in Europe and US for the respective risk groups.","['Benicio, Mariana Tereza de Lira', 'Ribeiro, Ana Flavia Tiburcio', 'Americo, Andre D', 'Furtado, Felipe M', 'Gloria, Ana B', 'Lima, Aleide S', 'Santos, Silvana M', 'Xavier, Sandra G', 'Lucena-Araujo, Antonio R', 'Fagundes, Evandro M', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['Benicio MTL', 'Ribeiro AFT', 'Americo AD', 'Furtado FM', 'Gloria AB', 'Lima AS', 'Santos SM', 'Xavier SG', 'Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Fagundes EM', 'Rego EM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pathology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Hematology Unit, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Hematology Unit, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Hematology Unit, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.

In acute promyelocytic leukemia, fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) with retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) results in an oncogene, PML-RARalpha (PR). Although previous studies have shown that both RARalpha and PML inhibit NRF2 activity, how PR regulates NRF2 has not been reported. Here, we discovered that PR-S, the short isoform of PR, potentiates NRF2 activity in a tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, PR-S colocalized with NRF2 in HeLa and HEK293T cells. The association of PR-S and NRF2 is mediated by the DNA-binding domains of RARalpha and the Neh7 domain of NRF2. Our results define a novel function of PR-S as a NRF2-transcriptional co-activator.","['Li, Yulong', 'Wang, Hongyan', 'Wang, Xiu Jun', 'Tang, Xiuwen']","['Li Y', 'Wang H', 'Wang XJ', 'Tang X']","['Department of Biochemistry, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170821,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",['NOTNLM'],"['* APL', '*NRF2', '*PML-RARalpha']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/12 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1873-3468.12779 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2017 Sep;591(18):2859-2868. doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.12779.

METHODS: Chromosome specimen was prepared from bone marrow samples using a direct method and (or) cultivation, and their karyotypes were analyzed with R banding. The clinical features, chemotherapeutic effect and survival status of patients with acquired +21 were evaluated. RESULTS: Cytogenetic studies were successfully performed on 3 329 patients with newly diagnosed AML, among which 31 (0.93%) had acquired +21. And 16 (0.48%) of the 31 patients had +21 as the sole abnormality. The most frequent subgroup of bone marrow morphology was AML-M5b, and its total number was 12 (38.7%) of the total. Thirty patients among those with +21 received standard chemotherapy. The complete remission (CR) rate (63% vs. 80%, P< 0.05) and median overall survival (OS) (7 months vs. 15 months, P< 0.01) of AML patients with acquired +21 were both lower than those without. Age (60 years or older) was associated with a significantly lower CR rate (30% vs. 80%, P< 0.05) and shorter median OS (4 months vs. 12 months, P< 0.01). Comparing to acquired +21 with other additional abnormalities, acquired +21 solely was associated with a lower median OS (6 months vs. 12 months, P< 0.05), but did not affect the CR rate (60% vs. 67%, P> 0.05). Three patients undergoing allogenetic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were still alive at the end of follow-up. Their survival time have reached 56, 36 and 105 months, respectively, which were remarkably longer than those only received chemotherapy (P< 0.01). CONCLUSION: The presence of acquired +21 in patients with AML has a adverse prognosis with or without other additional abnormalities. Older age (60 years or older) and +21 alone predicted relatively poorer outcome. Allo-HSCT was expected to prolong the survival time of AML patients with acquired +21.","['Lu, Ying', 'Yuan, Jiaojiao', 'Wang, Huafeng', 'Pei, Renzhi', 'Chen, Zhimei', 'Jin, Jie']","['Lu Y', 'Yuan J', 'Wang H', 'Pei R', 'Chen Z', 'Jin J']","['The Affiliated Yinzhou Hospital, Ningbo University Medical School, Yinzhou, Zhejiang 315040, China.

METHODS: Cytogenetic examination of bone marrow was performed on 13 cases of myeloid neophasms with double del(20q) after 24 hours of cell culture. R-banding was used to analyze the karyotypes. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using dual-color probes for 20q11/20q12. RESULTS: Double del(20q) was found to be the sole abnormality in 9 cases, double del(20q) and trisomy 9 was found in 1 case, trisomy del(20q) was found in 1 case, and sole del(20q) clone and double del(20q) clone were found to coexist in 2 cases. In 10 cases, interphase FISH showed one green and one red signal in cells with del(20q), which indicated deletion of both 20q11 and 20q12. Immunophenotyping of the leukemia cells showed positiveness for CD13 and/or CD33, CD117 in all 9 cases. Among these, co-expression of CD34 and/or HLA-DR was found in 6 cases, and coexpression of CD3 and CD7 was found in 1 case. Of the 13 cases, there were one AML-M6, nine MDS, one pure amegalokaryocye aplastic thrombocytopenia, one with normal morphology of bone marrow, and one undetermined due to dilution of the bone marrow by blood. Cytopenia were found in all cases. 9 of 13 cases died, and 4 survived with a median survival of 9 months. CONCLUSION: Double del(20q) is a rare but recurrent chromosomal abnormality derived from del(20q). It has unique clinical and laboratory features, and the prognosis is poor.","['Bai, Shuxiao', 'Wu, Chunxiao', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Chen, Suning', 'Pan, Jinlan']","['Bai S', 'Wu C', 'Zhang J', 'Chen S', 'Pan J']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, China.

Hence, novel targeted therapies are needed for patients with poor prognosis. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are drugs commonly administrated for B-ALL treatment. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway is frequently observed in B-ALL and contributes to GC-resistance. Here, we analyzed for the first time to our knowledge, the therapeutic potential of pan and isoform-selective PI3K p110 inhibitors, alone or combined with dexamethasone (DEX), in B-ALL leukemia cell lines and patient samples. We found that a pan PI3K p110 inhibitor displayed the most powerful cytotoxic effects in B-ALL cells, by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Both a pan PI3K p110 inhibitor and a dual gamma/delta PI3K p110 inhibitor sensitized B-ALL cells to DEX by restoring nuclear translocation of the GC receptor and counteracted stroma-induced DEX-resistance. Finally, gene expression analysis documented that, on one hand the combination consisting of a pan PI3K p110 inhibitor and DEX strengthened the DEX-induced up- or down-regulation of several genes involved in apoptosis, while on the other, it rescued the effects of genes that might be involved in GC-resistance. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that PI3K p110 inhibition could be a promising strategy for treating B-ALL patients by improving GC therapeutic effects and/or overcoming GC-resistance.","['Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Oliveira, Mariana', 'Fragoso, Rita', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Simioni, Carolina', 'Neri, Luca M', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Orsini, Ester', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Martelli, Alberto Maria', 'Evangelisti, Camilla']","['Evangelisti C', 'Cappellini A', 'Oliveira M', 'Fragoso R', 'Barata JT', 'Bertaina A', 'Locatelli F', 'Simioni C', 'Neri LM', 'Chiarini F', 'Lonetti A', 'Buontempo F', 'Orsini E', 'Pession A', 'Manzoli L', 'Martelli AM', 'Evangelisti C']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Human Social and Health Sciences, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, National Research Council, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, National Research Council, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170907,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (5-quinoxalin-6-ylmethylenethiazolidine-2,4-dione)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (MK 2206)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Triazines)', '0 (ZSTK474)', '610V23S0JI (duvelisib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Quinoxalines/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'Triazines/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'PI3K inhibitors', 'dexamethasone', 'targeted therapy']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26135 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Mar;233(3):1796-1811. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26135.

Here, we investigated the expression pattern of Dmrt1 in the testes of dairy goats. Dmrt1 primarily located in undifferentiated SSCs. Moreover, Dmrt1 enhanced differentiation and proliferation of mGSCs. On the contrary, the level of meiosis was down-regulated, as Dmrt1 determines whether SSCs undergo mitosis and spermatogonial differentiation or meiosis. In the busulfan-treated mice testes, Dmrt1 repair germ cell damage was emphasized as well. Our results exposed that Dmrt1 maintenance mGSCs in two ways: facilitating proliferation and self-renewal of SSCs; and reducing the inflammatory response caused by reproductive injury. These findings identify a central role for Dmrt1 in controlling population stability and injury restoring of SSCs.","['Wei, Yudong', 'Cai, Shufang', 'Ma, Fanglin', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Zhou, Zhe', 'Xu, Shuanshuan', 'Zhang, Mengfei', 'Peng, Sha', 'Hua, Jinlian']","['Wei Y', 'Cai S', 'Ma F', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou Z', 'Xu S', 'Zhang M', 'Peng S', 'Hua J']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170913,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DMRT1 protein)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult Germline Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Busulfan/toxicity', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Cell Self Renewal/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Dairying', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Goats/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mitosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Spermatogenesis/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Dmrt1', 'goat', 'male germline stem cells (mGSCs)', 'proliferation', 'self-renewal']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Mar;233(3):2537-2548. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26129.

Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of ATL patients enrolled in two studies are herein updated, namely NCT00355472 (phase I study of mogamulizumab in relapsed patients with ATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma) and NCT00920790 (phase II study for relapsed ATL). Of 13 patients with relapsed aggressive ATL in the phase I study, four (31%) survived >3 years. For 26 relapsed patients with aggressive ATL in the phase II study, median PFS was 5.2 months and 1-year PFS was 26%, whereas median OS was 14.4 months, and 3-year OS was 23%. For patients without a rash or who developed a grade 1 rash only, median PFS was 0.8 months, and 1-year PFS was zero, with a median OS of 6.0 months, and 3-year OS of 8%. In contrast, for patients who developed a rash >/=grade 2, median PFS was 11.7 months, and 1-year PFS was 50%, with a median OS of 25.6 months, and 3-year OS of 36%. Thus, we conclude that mogamulizumab monotherapy may improve PFS and OS in some patients with relapsed aggressive ATL, especially those who develop a skin rash as a moderate immune-related adverse event. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to validate the present observations and to clarify the mechanisms involved in the activity of mogamulizumab.","['Ishida, Takashi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Jo, Tatsuro', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Kato, Koji', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Takemoto, Shigeki', 'Suzushima, Hitoshi', 'Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Yoshimura, Kenichi', 'Kawamura, Kouichi', 'Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Ishida T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Jo T', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kato K', 'Yoshida S', 'Takemoto S', 'Suzushima H', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Yoshimura K', 'Kawamura K', 'Takahashi T', 'Tobinai K', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Institute for Clinical Research, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto Shinto General Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Innovative Clinical Research Center, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Affairs, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd, Otemachi Financial City Grand Cube, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Affairs, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd, Otemachi Financial City Grand Cube, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20170828,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', '*CC chemokine receptor 4', '*mogamulizumab', '*rash', '*regulatory T cell']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/06 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13343 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2017 Oct;108(10):2022-2029. doi: 10.1111/cas.13343.

Herein, we further determined H19 expression and its clinical implication in patients with CML. H19 expression and methylation were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR, and then clinical implication of H19 expression was further analyzed. H19 expression was significantly up-regulated in CML patients (p < 0.001). H19 expression with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.824 might serve as a promising biomarker in distinguishing CML patients from controls. The patients with high H19 expression had a tendency of higher white blood cells and BCR-ABL transcript than those with low H19 expression. H19 overexpression occurred with the higher frequency in blast crisis stage (11/11, 100%), lower in accelerated phase (3/5, 60%), and chronic phase (42/62, 66%) stages. Moreover, paired patients during disease progression with increased BCR-ABL transcript also showed a significant upregulation of H19 expression. Meanwhile, H19 expression was decreased in follow-up patients who achieved complete molecular remission after tyrosine kinase inhibitors-based therapy. Epigenetic studies showed that H19 differentially methylated region/imprinting control region (DMR/ICR) was hypomethylated and associated with H19 expression in CML patients. Moreover, demethylation of H19 DMR/ICR reactivated H19 expression in K562 cells. Collectively, H19 overexpression, a frequent event in CML, was associated with higher BCR-ABL transcript involving in disease progression. Moreover, H19 DMR/ICR hypomethylation in CML may be one of the mechanisms mediating H19 overexpression.","['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Guo, Hong', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhou JD', 'Lin J', 'Zhang TJ', 'Ma JC', 'Li XX', 'Wen XM', 'Guo H', 'Xu ZJ', 'Deng ZQ', 'Zhang W', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170830,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (H19 long non-coding RNA)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'H19', 'disease progression', 'expression', 'methylation']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26119 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Mar;233(3):2444-2450. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26119.

It has been reported that Mcl-1 is frequently overexpressed in lung cancer. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying Mcl-1 elevation in lung cancer is largely unknown. Here, we reported that Mcl-1 protein levels inversely correlate with FBXO4 expression, but not other F-box proteins examined, in lung cancer cell lines and lung cancer patient samples. Mechanically, FBXO4 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase to interact with and promote Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation. As a result, knockdown of Fbxo4 dramatically elevates Mcl-1 protein levels and increases cell survival and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas ectopic expression of FBXO4 displays opposite phenotypes. Therefore, our study suggests that the protein stability of Mcl-1 is governed by FBXO4, which plays an important role in cell survival and chemotherapy for lung cancer.","['Feng, C', 'Yang, F', 'Wang, J']","['Feng C', 'Yang F', 'Wang J']","[""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170804,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (FBXO4 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'F-Box Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",,,2017/08/05 06:00,2018/05/09 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['cgt201724 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2017.24 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2017 Aug;24(8):342-347. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2017.24.

We show that RA-induced differentiation of human leukemic cell lines and primary blasts dramatically increases their sensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing drugs at doses that are not toxic in the absence of RA. In addition, we demonstrate that the PERK pathway, triggered in response to ER stress, has a major protective role. Moreover, low amounts of pharmacologically induced ER stress are sufficient to strongly increase ATO toxicity. Indeed, in the presence of ER stress, ATO efficiently induced apoptosis in RA-sensitive and RA-resistant APL cell lines, at doses ineffective in the absence of ER stress. Our findings identify the ER stress-related pathways as potential targets in the search for novel therapeutic strategies in AML.","['Masciarelli, S', 'Capuano, E', 'Ottone, T', 'Divona, M', 'De Panfilis, S', 'Banella, C', 'Noguera, N I', 'Picardi, A', 'Fontemaggi, G', 'Blandino, G', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Fazi, F']","['Masciarelli S', 'Capuano E', 'Ottone T', 'Divona M', 'De Panfilis S', 'Banella C', 'Noguera NI', 'Picardi A', 'Fontemaggi G', 'Blandino G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Fazi F']","['Section of Histology and Medical Embryology, Department of Anatomical, Histological, Forensic and Orthopedic Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Section of Histology and Medical Embryology, Department of Anatomical, Histological, Forensic and Orthopedic Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Centre for Life Nano Science, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Rome Transplant Network, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Section of Histology and Medical Embryology, Department of Anatomical, Histological, Forensic and Orthopedic Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170804,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,2017/08/05 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017231 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.231 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Feb;32(2):285-294. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.231.

Some of these drivers could be pharmacologically targeted to choose the most effective personalized therapy in each CLL patient. Areas covered: In this article, the authors uncover the potential role of new targeted therapies against the most recurrent mutations in CLL as well as the recently approved therapies. The authors also provide their expert opinion and give their perspectives for the future. Expert opinion: The development of more personalized therapies is of interest to clinicians as a system to enhance the duration of treatment response and to extend the survival and quality of life of CLL patients. The main challenge, however, will be to translate the preclinical results into the clinics. Therefore, the designing and execution of clinical trials focused on molecular drivers are the need of the hour.","['Tripathi, Rupal', 'Lee-Verges, Eriong', 'Higashi, Morihiro', 'Gimenez, Neus', 'Rosich, Laia', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Tripathi R', 'Lee-Verges E', 'Higashi M', 'Gimenez N', 'Rosich L', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Colomer D']","[""a Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hematopathology Unit , Hospital Clinic, CIBERONC , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hematopathology Unit , Hospital Clinic, CIBERONC , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hematopathology Unit , Hospital Clinic, CIBERONC , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hematopathology Unit , Hospital Clinic, CIBERONC , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hematopathology Unit , Hospital Clinic, CIBERONC , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hematopathology Unit , Hospital Clinic, CIBERONC , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hematopathology Unit , Hospital Clinic, CIBERONC , Barcelona , Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170804,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Precision Medicine', 'Quality of Life', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR signaling', '*BIRC3', '*MYD88', '*NOTCH1', '*SF3B1', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*recurrent mutations']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2017.1362387 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2017 Oct;12(10):1041-1052. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2017.1362387.

To facilitate the detection of this rearrangement, we studied NUP98-NSD1 transcript variants in patients with the t(5;11) using paired-end RNA sequencing and standard molecular biology techniques. We discovered three NUP98-NSD1 transcripts with two fusion junctions (NUP98 exon 11-12/NSD1 exon 6), alternative 5' donor site in NUP98 exon 7, and NSD1 exon 7 skipping. Two of the transcripts were in-frame and occurred in all t(5;11) samples (N = 5). The exonic splicing events were present in all samples (N = 23) regardless of the NUP98-NSD1 suggesting that these novel splice events are unassociated with t(5;11). In conclusion, we provide evidence of two different NUP98-NSD1 fusion transcripts in adult AML, which result in functional proteins and represent suitable molecular entities for monitoring t(5;11) AML patients.","['Kivioja, Jarno L', 'Lopez Marti, Jesus M', 'Kumar, Ashwini', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Edgren, Henrik', 'Parsons, Alun', 'Lundan, Tuija', 'Wolf, Maija', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Heckman, Caroline A']","['Kivioja JL', 'Lopez Marti JM', 'Kumar A', 'Kontro M', 'Edgren H', 'Parsons A', 'Lundan T', 'Wolf M', 'Porkka K', 'Heckman CA']","['a Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland.', 'a Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland.', 'a Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland.', 'b Department of Hematology , Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center , Helsinki , Finland.', 'c MediSapiens Ltd. , Helsinki , Finland.', 'a Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland.', 'd Department of Clinical Chemistry and TYKSLAB , Turku University Central Hospital, University of Turku , Turku , Finland.', 'a Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland.', 'b Department of Hematology , Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center , Helsinki , Finland.', 'a Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170804,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NUP98-NSD1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*11p15.5 translocation', '*NSD1', '*NUP98', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*alternative splicing']",2017/08/05 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1357174 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Mar;59(3):725-732. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1357174.

METHODS: Vital registration system and cancer registry data from the EMR region were analyzed for 29 cancer groups in 22 EMR countries using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 methodology. RESULTS: In 2015, cancer was responsible for 9.4% of all deaths and 5.1% of all DALYs. It accounted for 722,646 new cases, 379,093 deaths, and 11.7 million DALYs. Between 2005 and 2015, incident cases increased by 46%, deaths by 33%, and DALYs by 31%. The increase in cancer incidence was largely driven by population growth and population aging. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia were the most common cancers, while lung, breast, and stomach cancers caused most cancer deaths.

The current study analyzed the relationship between polymorphisms of phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, cytochromes P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and CYP2D6 and childhood ALL in Kashmir, India. We recruited 200 confirmed ALL cases, and an equal number of controls, matched for sex, age and district of residence to the respective case. Information was obtained on various lifestyle and environmental factors in face to face interviews with the parents/attendants of each subject. Genotypes of CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Compared to the GG genotype, we found a higher ALL risk in subjects who harbored variant (AA) genotype (OR=20.9; 95% CI: 6.01-73.1, P<0.0001) and AG genotype (OR=42.6; 95% CI: 8.3-217.5, P<0.0001) of CYP2D6*4 polymorphism. Although, we found a significant association of CYP1A1*2A polymorphism with ALL risk, but the risk did not persist in the adjusted model (OR=6.76; 95% CI: 0.63-71.8, P=0.100). The study indicates that unlike CYP1A1*2A, CYP2D6*4 polymorphism is associated with ALL risk. However, more replicative studies with larger sample size are needed to substantiate our findings.","['Nida, Sadiq', 'Javid, Bhat', 'Akbar, Masood', 'Idrees, Shah', 'Adil, Wani', 'Ahmad, Ganai Bashir']","['Nida S', 'Javid B', 'Akbar M', 'Idrees S', 'Adil W', 'Ahmad GB']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Clinical Heamatology, Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Center of Research Development (CORD), University of Kashmir Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Mol Biol Res Commun,Molecular biology research communications,101613459,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia', 'Kashmir', 'Polymorphism', 'Xenobiotics']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/08/05 06:01,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol Res Commun. 2017 Jun;6(2):77-84.,,,,PMC5534522,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This leads to a wide variety of clinical manifestations resulting from excessive mediator release in CM and benign forms of SM (indolent SM, ISM) and from tissue mast cell infiltration causing multiorgan dysfunction and failure in more aggressive subtypes (aggressive SM, ASM, or mast cell leukemia). In addition, SM may be associated with hematological neoplasms (AHN). While treatment of ISM primarily aims at symptom management with anti-mediator therapies, cytoreductive and targeted therapies are needed to control the expansion of neoplastic mast cells in advanced forms of SM, in order to improve overall survival. Mast cell accumulation results from a gain-of-function mutation (mostly the D816V mutation) within the KIT tyrosine kinase domain expressed by mast cells and additional genetic and epigenetic mutations may further determine the features of the disease (ASM and AHN). Consequently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and targeted therapies directed against the oncogenic signaling machinery downstream of KIT are attractive therapeutic approaches. A better understanding of the relative contribution of these genetic and epigenetic events to the molecular pathogenesis of mastocytosis is of particular interest for the development of targeted therapies and therefore to better choose patient subgroups that would best benefit from a given therapeutic strategy.","['Vaes, Melanie', 'Benghiat, Fleur Samantha', 'Hermine, Olivier']","['Vaes M', 'Benghiat FS', 'Hermine O']","['Department of Hematology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, CHU Tivoli, La Louviere, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.', ""French Reference Center for Mastocytosis (CEREMAST), Department of Hematology, Necker Children's Hospital, APHP, Paris, France."", 'Imagine Institute for Genetic Diseases (INSERM U1163 CNRS ERL 8654), Paris Descartes University, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170720,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['KIT', 'mast cell', 'systemic mastocytosis', 'targeted treatment', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/08/05 06:01,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2017.00110 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2017 Jul 20;4:110. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2017.00110. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5517467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between ORR, CR, CRi or better (CRi+CR) rates and median OS to determine whether response rates could be used as predictors of median OS in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: A review of published literature was conducted to identify relevant AML clinical trials. Weighted linear regression was performed with various linearizing transformations of response rates and median OS. Covariates of interest were evaluated using a forward inclusion, backward elimination covariate model building procedure at alpha=0.01 and alpha=0.005, respectively. Results: Twenty trials involving 26 cohorts were included in the meta-analysis. Azactidine treatment was a significant predictor with longer OS compared to decitabine or low dose cytarabine for a given response rate (P < 0.005). Linear regression analysis indicated that the correlation of both CRi or better rates and CR rates with median OS was higher than that of ORR with median OS. The final model showed a strong correlation between CRi or better rates and median OS (R(2)=0.66). Conclusion: Significant correlation between CRi or better rates and median OS in AML highlights the potential for CRi or better rate, in addition to CR rate, to serve as surrogate markers for median OS.","['Agarwal, Suresh K', 'Mangal, Naveen', 'Menon, Rajeev M', 'Freise, Kevin J', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Agarwal SK', 'Mangal N', 'Menon RM', 'Freise KJ', 'Salem AH']","['Abbvie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Center for Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology, University of Florida, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Abbvie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170603,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'meta-analysis.', 'overall survival', 'response rates', 'surrogate endpoints']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/08/05 06:01,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.18686 [doi]', 'jcav08p1562 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2017 Jun 3;8(9):1562-1567. doi: 10.7150/jca.18686. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5535711,"['Competing Interests: AbbVie participated in database preparation, data analysis,', 'writing, reviewing and approval of the manuscript.

Unfortunately, long-term survivors are faced with consequences of secondary neoplasia, including radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs). We characterized 31 RIMs with exome/NF2 intronic sequencing, RNA sequencing and methylation profiling, and found NF2 gene rearrangements in 12/31 of RIMs, an observation previously unreported in sporadic meningioma (SM). Additionally, known recurrent mutations characteristic of SM, including AKT1, KLF4, TRAF7 and SMO, were not observed in RIMs. Combined losses of chromosomes 1p and 22q were common in RIMs (16/18 cases) and overall, chromosomal aberrations were more complex than that observed in SM. Patterns of DNA methylation profiling supported similar cell of origin between RIMs and SMs. The findings indicate that the mutational landscape of RIMs is distinct from SMs, and have significant therapeutic implications for survivors of childhood cranial radiation and the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of meningiomas.Radiation-induced meningiomas are often more aggressive than sporadic ones. In this study, the authors perform an exome, methylation and RNA-seq analysis of 31 cases of radiation-induced meningioma and show NF2 rearrangement, an observation previously unreported in the sporadic tumors.","['Agnihotri, Sameer', 'Suppiah, Suganth', 'Tonge, Peter D', 'Jalali, Shahrzad', 'Danesh, Arnavaz', 'Bruce, Jeffery P', 'Mamatjan, Yasin', 'Klironomos, George', 'Gonen, Lior', 'Au,

The aim of this study was to analyze persistent hematologic dysfunction (PHD) after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP NETs). Methods: The incidence and course of PHD were analyzed in 274 GEP NET patients from a group of 367 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors. PHD was defined as diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), MDS/MPN, or otherwise unexplained cytopenia (for >6 mo). Using data from The Netherlands Cancer Registry, the expected number of hematopoietic neoplasms (MDS, AML, MPN, and MDS/MPN) was calculated and adjusted for sex, age, and follow-up period. The following risk factors were assessed: sex, age over 70 y, bone metastasis, prior chemotherapy, prior external-beam radiotherapy, uptake on the [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide scan, tumor load, grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity during treatment, estimated absorbed BM dose, elevated plasma chromogranin A level, baseline blood counts, and renal function. Results: Eleven (4%) of the 274 patients had PHD after treatment with (177)Lu-DOTATATE: 8 patients (2.9%) developed a hematopoietic neoplasm (4 MDS, 1 AML, 1 MPN, and 2 MDS/MPN) and 3 patients (1.1%) developed BM failure characterized by cytopenia and BM aplasia. The median latency period at diagnosis (or first suspicion of a PHD) was 41 mo (range, 15-84 mo). The expected number of hematopoietic neoplasms based on The Netherlands Cancer Registry data was 3.0, resulting in a relative risk of 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.7-10.0). No risk factors for PHD could be identified for the GEP NET patients, not even bone metastasis or estimated BM dose. Seven patients with PHD developed anemia in combination with a rise in mean corpuscular volume. Conclusion: The prevalence of PHD after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE was 4% in our patient population. The median time at which PHD developed was 41 mo after the first PRRT cycle. The relative risk for developing a hematopoietic neoplasm was 2.7.

Both antigen receptor and co-stimulatory receptors, including Toll-like receptors, can modulate viability and proliferation of leukemic cells. Toll-like receptor ligands, and particularly the TLR9 ligand CpG, mediate heterogeneous responses in patients' samples reflecting the clinical course of the subjects. However, the molecular framework of the key signaling events underlying such heterogeneity is undefined. We focused our studies on a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases characterized by expression of CD38 and unmutated immunoglobulin genes, who respond to CpG with enhanced metabolic cell activity. We report that, while CpG induces NFKBIZ mRNA in all the samples analyzed, it induces the IkappaBzeta protein in a selected group of cases, through an unanticipated post-transcriptional mechanism. Interestingly, IkappaBzeta plays a causal role in sustaining CpG-induced cell viability and chemoresistance, and CpG stimulation can unleash immunoglobulin secretion by IkappaBzeta-positive malignant cells. These results identify and characterize IkappaBzeta as a marker and effector molecule of distinct key pathways in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Fonte, Eleonora', 'Vilia, Maria Giovanna', 'Reverberi, Daniele', 'Sana, Ilenia', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Ranghetti, Pamela', 'Orfanelli, Ugo', 'Cenci, Simone', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Muzio, Marta']","['Fonte E', 'Vilia MG', 'Reverberi D', 'Sana I', 'Scarfo L', 'Ranghetti P', 'Orfanelli U', 'Cenci S', 'Cutrona G', 'Ghia P', 'Muzio M']","['Cell Signaling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Cell Signaling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'UOC Patologia Molecolare, IRCCS AOU S.

Ibrutinib, the first-in-class inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, and idelalisib, the first-in-class inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta, have recently been approved for the treatment of several indolent B-cell malignancies. These drugs are especially being used for previously unmet needs, i.e., for patients with relapsed or refractory disease, high-risk cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, or with comorbidities. Treatment with ibrutinib and idelalisib is generally well tolerated, even by elderly patients.

Nevertheless, the understanding of the complex interplay between the various types of bystander cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells is incomplete. Numerous studies have indicated that bystander cells provide chronic lymphocytic leukemia-supportive functions, but it has also become clear that chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells actively engage in the formation of a supportive tumor microenvironment through several cross-talk mechanisms. In this review, we describe how chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells participate in this interplay by inducing migration and tumor-supportive differentiation of bystander cells. Furthermore, chronic lymphocytic leukemia-mediated alterations in the interactions between bystander cells are discussed. Upon bystander cell interaction, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as migratory factors [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 22 and chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2], which result in further recruitment of T cells but also of monocyte-derived cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells induce differentiation towards a tumor-supportive M2 phenotype of monocyte-derived cells and suppress phagocytosis, but also induce increased numbers of supportive regulatory T cells. Like other tumor types, the differentiation of stromal cells towards supportive cancer-associated fibroblasts is critically dependent on chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived factors such as exosomes and platelet-derived growth factor. Lastly, both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and bystander cells induce a tolerogenic tumor microenvironment; chronic lymphocytic leukemia-secreted cytokines, such as interleukin-10, suppress cytotoxic T-cell functions, while chronic lymphocytic leukemia-associated monocyte-derived cells contribute to suppression of T-cell function by producing the immune checkpoint factor, programmed cell death-ligand 1. Deeper understanding of the active involvement and cross-talk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in shaping the tumor microenvironment may offer novel clues for designing therapeutic strategies.","['van Attekum, Martijn Ha', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Kater, Arnon P']","['van Attekum MH', 'Eldering E', 'Kater AP']","['Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands a.p.kater@amc.nl.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170803,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bystander Effect/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Movement/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology']",,,2017/08/05 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.142679 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.142679 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Sep;102(9):1469-1476. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.142679.

We compared the safety and efficacy of low-dose decitabine vs low-dose azacitidine in this group of patients. Adults with low- or intermediate 1-risk MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, were randomly assigned using a Bayesian adaptive design to receive either azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) intravenously/subcutaneously daily or decitabine 20 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 3 consecutive days on a 28-day cycle. The primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR). Between November 2012 and February 2016, 113 patients were treated: 40 (35%) with azacitidine and 73 (65%) with decitabine. The median age was 70 years; 81% of patients were intermediate 1-risk patients. The median number of cycles received was 9. The ORRs were 70% and 49% (P = .03) for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively. Thirty-two percent of patients treated with decitabine became transfusion independent compared with 16% of patients treated with azacitidine (P = .2). Cytogenetic response rates were 61% and 25% (P = .02), respectively. With a median follow-up of 20 months, the overall median event-free survival was 18 months: 20 and 13 months for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively (P = .1).

We identified profilin 2 (Pfn2) mRNA, which encodes an actin-binding protein involved in endocytosis and neurotransmitter release, as a novel IRP-interacting transcript, and studied its role in iron metabolism. A combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments and bioinformatic analyses led to the identification of an atypical and conserved IRE in the 3' untranslated region of Pfn2 mRNA. Pfn2 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in duodenal samples from mice with intestinal IRP ablation, suggesting that IRPs exert a positive effect on Pfn2 mRNA expression in vivo. Overexpression of Pfn2 in HeLa and Hepa1-6 cells reduced their metabolically active iron pool. Importantly, Pfn2-deficient mice showed iron accumulation in discrete areas of the brain (olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and midbrain) and reduction of the hepatic iron store without anemia. Despite low liver iron levels, hepatic hepcidin expression remained high, likely because of compensatory activation of hepcidin by mild inflammation. Splenic ferroportin was increased probably to sustain hematopoiesis. Overall, our results indicate that Pfn2 expression is controlled by the IRPs in vivo and that Pfn2 contributes to maintaining iron homeostasis in cell lines and mice.","['Luscieti, Sara', 'Galy, Bruno', 'Gutierrez, Lucia', 'Reinke, Michael', 'Couso, Jorge', 'Shvartsman, Maya', 'Di Pascale, Antonio', 'Witke, Walter', 'Hentze, Matthias W', 'Pilo Boyl, Pietro', 'Sanchez, Mayka']","['Luscieti S', 'Galy B', 'Gutierrez L', 'Reinke M', 'Couso J', 'Shvartsman M', 'Di Pascale A', 'Witke W', 'Hentze MW', 'Pilo Boyl P', 'Sanchez M']","['Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias and Pujol Research Institute, Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Spain.', 'Iron Metabolism: Regulation and Diseases Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Division of Virus-Associated Carcinogenesis, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biomaterials and Bioinspired Materials, Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute of Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias and Pujol Research Institute, Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Spain.', 'Iron Metabolism: Regulation and Diseases Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias and Pujol Research Institute, Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias and Pujol Research Institute, Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Spain.', 'Iron Metabolism: Regulation and Diseases Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170803,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Profilins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Duodenum/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Organ Specificity', 'Profilins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics']",,,2017/08/05 06:00,2017/11/07 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32766-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-11-754382 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Oct 26;130(17):1934-1945. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-11-754382.

With well-known risk factors including allogeneic HSCT and GVHD, tuberculosis (TB) has a higher incidence and shorter survival rate in HSCT recipients than in the general population. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old Indonesian female with a history of latent TB was found to have acute myeloid leukemia 3 months after allogeneic HSCT. She presented with fever, abdominal pain, and predominant cholestatic-type liver function tests derangement. Computed tomography scans showed a relatively unremarkable liver. Liver biopsy specimens revealed multiple necrotizing granulomas with numerous acid-fast bacilli shown using Ziehl-Neelsen histochemical stain. No fungal organisms are detected by Grocott's methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff stains. There was also mild portal hepatitis with prominent bile duct injury and scattered apoptotic bodies, compatible with GVHD. In addition, the patient was also discovered to have cutaneous and intestinal TB as well as cutaneous and colonic GVHD during investigation. She was started on anti-TB treatment and adjusted immunosuppression scheme accordingly. Unfortunately, our patient died of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage approximately 2 months after the diagnosis of post-transplantation TB and GVHD. CONCLUSION: We report a case of concurrent hepatic TB and GVHD in an allogeneic HSCT recipient. Recognition of the dual pathology in the biopsy results aids proper treatment.","['Zhao, Z', 'Leow, W Q']","['Zhao Z', 'Leow WQ']","['Department of Anatomical Pathology, Division of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, Division of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.

METHODS: A total of 40 ALL children with long-term disease-free survival were enrolled as study group, and 40 healthy children were enrolled as control group. The Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC), continuous performance test (CPT), and Stroop test software were used for the evaluation of all children. Neurocognitive function was compared between groups and influencing factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the study group had significantly lower full intelligence quotient, verbal intelligence quotient, and performance intelligence quotient in C-WICS (P<0.05) and significantly higher numbers of mistakes and misses in CPT (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the numbers of correct answers, mistakes, and misses of word-color consistency between the study group and the control group (P>0.05), while the study group had significantly higher numbers of mistakes and misses of word-color contradiction and irrelevance (P<0.05). The total dose of high-dose methotrexate and ALL risk classification were associated with the reduction in intelligence quotient, and children's younger age at diagnosis of ALL was associated with the higher numbers of misses and mistakes.

Therefore, the present study was aimed to appraise the polarity directed antioxidant, cytotoxic, protein kinase inhibitory, antileishmanial and glucose modulatory attributes of a Himalayan medicinal plant- Quercus dilatata. METHODS: Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined colorimetrically and various polyphenols were identified by RP-HPLC analysis. Brine shrimp lethality, SRB and MTT assays were employed to test cytotoxicity against Artemia salina and human cancer cell lines respectively. Antileishmanial activity was determined using standard MTT protocol. Glucose modulation was assessed by alpha-amylase inhibition assay while disc diffusion assay was used to establish protein kinase inhibitory and antifungal spectrum. RESULTS: Among 14 extracts of aerial parts, distilled water-acetone extract demonstrated maximum extract recovery (10.52% w/w), phenolic content (21.37 +/- 0.21 mug GAE/mg dry weight (DW)), total antioxidant capacity (4.81 +/- 0.98 mug AAE/mg DW) and reducing power potential (20.03 +/- 2.4 mug/mg DW). On the other hand, Distilled water extract proficiently extracted flavonoid content (4.78 +/- 0.51 mug QE/mg DW). RP-HPLC analysis revealed the presence of significant amounts of phenolic metabolites (0.049 to 15.336 mug/mg extract) including, pyrocatechol, gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and quercetin. Highest free radical scavenging capacity was found in Methanol-Ethyl acetate extract (IC50 8.1 +/- 0.5 mug/ml). In the brine shrimp toxicity assay, most of the tested extracts (57%) showed high cytotoxicity. Among these, Chloroform-Methanol extract had highest cytotoxicity against THP-1 cell line (IC50 3.88 +/- 0.53 mug/ml). About 50% of the extracts were found to be moderately antiproliferative against Hep G2 cell line. Methanol extract exhibited considerable protein kinase inhibitory activity against Streptomyces 85E strain (28 +/- 0.35 mm bald phenotype at 100 mug/disc; MIC = 12.5 mug/ disc) while, Chloroform extract displayed maximum antidiabetic activity (alpha-amylase inhibition of 21.61 +/- 1.53% at 200 mug/ml concentration). The highest antileishmanial potential was found in Ethyl acetate-Acetone extract (12.91 +/- 0.02% at 100 mug/ml concentration), while, Q. dilatata extracts also showed a moderate antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: This study proposes that multiple-solvent system is a crucial variable to elucidate pharmacological potential of Q. dilatata and the results of the present findings prospects its potential as a resource for the discovery of novel anticancer, antidiabetic, antileishmanial and antioxidant agents.","['Ahmed, Madiha', 'Fatima, Humaira', 'Qasim, Muhammad', 'Gul, Bilquees', 'Ihsan-Ul-Haq']","['Ahmed M', 'Fatima H', 'Qasim M', 'Gul B', 'Ihsan-Ul-Haq']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, 45320, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, 45320, Pakistan.', 'Institute of Sustainable Halophyte Utilization, University of Karachi, Karachi, 75270, Pakistan.', 'Institute of Sustainable Halophyte Utilization, University of Karachi, Karachi, 75270, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, 45320, Pakistan. ihsn99@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170803,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Solvents)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', 'EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-Amylases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Flavonoids/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Herbal Medicine', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leishmania/drug effects', 'Medicine, Traditional', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Phenols/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Components, Aerial', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quercus/*chemistry', 'Solvents', 'Streptomyces/drug effects', 'Trypanocidal Agents/*pharmacology', 'alpha-Amylases/antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Antileishmanial', 'Antioxidant', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Hep G2', 'Protein kinase inhibition', 'THP-1 leukemia cell line']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12906-017-1894-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-017-1894-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2017 Aug 3;17(1):386. doi: 10.1186/s12906-017-1894-x.,,,,PMC5543555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from all patients diagnosed with AML between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015 were retrieved from a single, centralized cancer cytogenetics laboratory for bone marrow samples, the sole diagnostic facility of its kind in Southern Alberta. RESULTS: The calculated incidence rate was 2.79 cases per 100,000 person-years with a median age of 60, slightly lower than previously published data. The age-standardized incidence rate for Canada was 3.46 cases per 100,000 person-years. The higher value is reflective of Calgary's younger population compared to the rest of Canada. Higher male incidence and greatest incidence occurring at approximately the age of 85 is similar to data from other developed countries. The lower incidence rates and median age of diagnosis, in comparison with that of other high-income nations, may be due to differences in the proportion of aging citizens in the population. CONCLUSION: This is the first published incidence rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Canada across all age groups.","['Shysh, Andrea Christine', 'Nguyen, Leonard Tu', 'Guo, Maggie', 'Vaska, Marcus', 'Naugler, Christopher', 'Rashid-Kolvear, Fariborz']","['Shysh AC', 'Nguyen LT', 'Guo M', 'Vaska M', 'Naugler C', 'Rashid-Kolvear F']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Knowledge Resource Service, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. fariborz.kolvear@cls.ab.ca.', 'Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada. fariborz.kolvear@cls.ab.ca.', 'Diagnostic and Scientific Centre, 2E-415, 9 3535 Research Road NW, Calgary, AB, T2L2K8, Canada. fariborz.kolvear@cls.ab.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170803,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alberta/epidemiology', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelogenous leukemia', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Canada', '*Cancer epidemiology', '*Hematological neoplasm, incidence']",2017/08/05 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12889-017-4644-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12889-017-4644-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2017 Aug 3;18(1):94. doi: 10.1186/s12889-017-4644-6.,['RN254781-333204/CIHR/Canada'],,,PMC5543578,,,,,,,,,,,,,['BMC Public Health. 2017 Sep 22;17 (1):736.

Adverse events (AEs) associated with TKIs are significant impediments in the daily life of patients that can impact compliance, and efficacy. Areas covered: This is a review on safety of bosutinib in the treatment of chronic phase CML. Data is extracted from the latest updates of bosutinib phase I/II and III trials. Expert opinion: Bosutinib is an effective agent against all phases of CML presently approved for the treatment in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior TKI therapy. Bosutinib has a unique toxicity profile characterized by early and transient diarrhea. Otherwise, the AE profile of bosutinib is comparable to other TKIs, with the exception of cardiovascular AEs that are infrequent in bosutinib-treated patients. Similar to other TKIs, the minimum effective dose of bosutinib remains unknown. Better definition of the optimal effective dose may spare, for those patients otherwise benefitting from treatment, unnecessary AEs.","['Kong, Jee Hyun', 'Khoury, H J', 'Kim, Audrey Sunwha', 'Hill, Brittany Gray', 'Kota, Vamsi']","['Kong JH', 'Khoury HJ', 'Kim AS', 'Hill BG', 'Kota V']","['a Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'a Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Emory University Winship Cancer Institute , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20170905,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinolines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'efficacy', 'safety']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14740338.2017.1363176 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2017 Oct;16(10):1203-1209. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2017.1363176.

The aim of the present study was to identify genes differentially expressed in MSCs isolated from CML patients at diagnosis (CML-MSCs) as compared to MSCs from healthy controls. Using a custom gene-profiling assay, we identified six genes over-expressed in CML-MSCs (BMP1, FOXO3, MET, MITF, NANOG, PDPN), with the two highest levels being documented for PDPN (PODOPLANIN) and NANOG. To determine whether this aberrant signature persisted in patients in deep molecular response induced by TKIs, we analyzed MSCs derived from such patients (MR-MSCs). This analysis showed that, despite the deep molecular responses, BMP1, MET, MITF, NANOG, and PDPN mRNA were upregulated in MR-MSCs. Moreover, BMP1, MITF, and NANOG mRNA expressions in MR-MSCs were found to be intermediate between control MSCs and CML-MSCs. These results suggest that CML-MSCs exhibit an abnormal gene expression pattern which might have been established during the leukemogenic process and persist in patients in deep molecular response.","['Aggoune, Djamel', 'Sorel, Nathalie', 'Bonnet, Marie-Laure', 'Goujon, Jean-Michel', 'Tarte, Karin', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Domenech, Jorge', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Johnson-Ansa, Hyacinthe', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Cayssials, Emilie', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Aggoune D', 'Sorel N', 'Bonnet ML', 'Goujon JM', 'Tarte K', 'Herault O', 'Domenech J', 'Rea D', 'Legros L', 'Johnson-Ansa H', 'Rousselot P', 'Cayssials E', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Chomel JC', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Service de Cancerologie Biologique, F-86021 Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', ""CHU de Poitiers, Service d'Anatomie et cytologie pathologiques, F-86021 Poitiers, France; INSERM, U1082, F-86021 Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM, U917, F-35043 Rennes, France.', ""CHU de Tours, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F-37032 Tours, France; CNRS UMR 7292, equipe LNOx, Universite Francois Rabelais, F-37032 Tours, France."", ""CHU de Tours, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F-37032 Tours, France; CNRS UMR 7292, equipe LNOx, Universite Francois Rabelais, F-37032 Tours, France."", ""Hopital Saint Louis, Service d'Hematologie Adulte, F-75000 Paris, France; INSERM, UMRS-1160, IUH-Universite Paris Diderot-Paris 7, F-75000 Paris, France."", ""Hopital l'Archet, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, F-06202 Nice, France."", ""CHU de Caen, Service d'Hematologie, F-14003 Caen, France."", ""Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Service d'Hematologie et Oncologie, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France; EA4340, Universite Versailles-Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Universite Paris-Saclay, France."", ""INSERM, CIC-P 0802, F-86000 Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, F-86000, Poitiers, France."", ""CHU Brabois Vandoeuvre, Service d'Hematologie, F-54511 Nancy, France."", ""Hopital Paul Brousse, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F-94800 Villejuif, France; NSERM U935, F-94807 Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, F-94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Service de Cancerologie Biologique, F-86021 Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France; Hopital Paul Brousse, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F-94800 Villejuif, France; NSERM U935, F-94807 Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, F-94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France; Hopital Bicetre, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F-94270 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.

Targeting for folate receptor (FR)-expressing tumors, we optimized siRNA polyplexes by coformulating a folate-PEG-oligoaminoamide (for surface shielding and targeting) with one of three lipo-oligoaminoamides (optionally tyrosine-modified, for optimizing stability and size) to generate approximately 100 nm targeted lipopolyplexes (TLPs), which self-stabilize by cysteine disulfide cross-links. To better understand parameters for improved tumor-directed gene silencing, we analyzed intracellular distribution and siRNA release kinetics. FR-mediated endocytosis and endosomal escape of TLPs was confirmed by immuno-TEM. We monitored colocalization of TLPs with endosomes and lysosomes, and onset of siRNA release by time-lapse confocal microscopy; analyzed intracellular stability by FRET using double-labeled siRNA; and correlated results with knockdown of eGFPLuc protein and EG5 mRNA expression. The most potent formulation, TLP1, containing lipopolyplex-stabilizing tyrosine trimers, was found to unpack siRNA in sustained manner with up to 5-fold higher intracellular siRNA stability after 4 h compared to other TLPs. Unexpectedly, data indicated that intracellular siRNA stability instead of an early endosomal exit dominate as a deciding factor for silencing efficiency of TLPs. After i.v. administration in a subcutaneous leukemia mouse model, TLP1 exhibited ligand-dependent tumoral siRNA retention, resulting in 65% EG5 gene silencing at mRNA level without detectable adverse effects. In sum, tyrosine-modified TLP1 conveys superior protection of siRNA for an effective tumor-targeted delivery and RNAi in vivo.","['Lee, Dian-Jang', 'Kessel, Eva', 'Lehto, Taavi', 'Liu, Xueying', 'Yoshinaga, Naoto', 'Padari, Kart', 'Chen, Ying-Chen', 'Kempter, Susanne', 'Uchida, Satoshi', 'Radler, Joachim O', 'Pooga, Margus', 'Sheu, Ming-Thau', 'Kataoka, Kazunori', 'Wagner, Ernst']","['Lee DJ', 'Kessel E', 'Lehto T', 'Liu X', 'Yoshinaga N', 'Padari K', 'Chen YC', 'Kempter S', 'Uchida S', 'Radler JO', 'Pooga M', 'Sheu MT', 'Kataoka K', 'Wagner E']","['Department of Pharmacy and Center for NanoScience, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen , Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM) , Schellingstr. 4, 80799 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Center for NanoScience, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen , Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM) , Schellingstr. 4, 80799 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Center for NanoScience, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen , Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Innovation Center of NanoMedicine (iCONM), Institute of Industry Promotion-Kawasaki , 3-25-14 Tonomachi, Kawasaki-ku, 210-0821 Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656 Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology and Institute of Technology, University of Tartu , 23 Riia Str., 51010 Tartu, Estonia.', 'School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University , No. 250, Wuxin St., 11031 Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Physics and Center for NanoScience, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen , Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, 80539 Munich, Germany.', 'Innovation Center of NanoMedicine (iCONM), Institute of Industry Promotion-Kawasaki , 3-25-14 Tonomachi, Kawasaki-ku, 210-0821 Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656 Tokyo, Japan.', 'Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM) , Schellingstr. 4, 80799 Munich, Germany.', 'Faculty of Physics and Center for NanoScience, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen , Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, 80539 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology and Institute of Technology, University of Tartu , 23 Riia Str., 51010 Tartu, Estonia.', 'School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University , No. 250, Wuxin St., 11031 Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Innovation Center of NanoMedicine (iCONM), Institute of Industry Promotion-Kawasaki , 3-25-14 Tonomachi, Kawasaki-ku, 210-0821 Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Policy Alternatives Research Institute, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-0033 Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Center for NanoScience, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen , Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM) , Schellingstr. 4, 80799 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170824,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (KIF11 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (poly(ethylene glycol)-folate)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Kif11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored/metabolism', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinesins/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Mice, Nude', 'Polyethylene Glycols/analysis/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/genetics/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'RNAi Therapeutics/*methods']",,,2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00383 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2017 Sep 20;28(9):2393-2409. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00383.

To clarify the efficacy and the safety of FLAG-idarubicin (IDA) for children prospectively, we planned a multicenter phase II study (AML-R11) by the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. METHODS: Patients with AML aged between 2 and 20 years old, who had the first bone marrow (BM) relapse or induction failure, were enrolled. The FLAG-IDA regimen consisted of Flu 30 mg/m(2) for 5 days, Ara-C 2 g/m(2) for 5 days, G-CSF (lenograstim) 5 mug/kg for 6 days and IDA 10 mg/m(2) for 3 days. The primary endpoint was remission rate after therapy. RESULTS: Due to drug supply issues, the trial was suspended after the inclusion of seven eligible patients. There were six cases of early relapse within 1 year of the first remission. All seven patients completed the therapy and no early death was observed. Hematological toxicity was common, and one patient developed grade 4 non-hematological toxicity of bacterial meningitis.

Another well-known role for A20 is to protect cells from TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. Depletion of NF-kappaB in differentiating U937 monocytic leukemia cells is known to cause apoptotic cell death; however, much remains to be explored about the molecules that are expressed in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner and which support monocyte-macrophage differentiation. Using the monocytic cell line THP-1, and peripheral blood monocytes, we show here a sustained increase in A20 expression during monocyte-macrophage differentiation, which coincided with high NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity. Depletion of NF-kappaB by stable expression of a super-repressor form of IkappaBalpha in THP-1 cells caused remarkable cell death during phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation. A20 expression in these cells did not alter this NF-kappaB suppression, but was sufficient to protect the cells and restore the cell surface expression of a differentiation marker (CD11b) and phagocytic activity. Mutational analyses revealed that this A20 activity requires the carboxy-terminal zinc-finger domain, but not its deubiquitinase activity. Based on these findings, we conclude that A20, when ectopically expressed, can support both survival and differentiation of THP-1 cells in the absence of sustained NF-kappaB activity.","['Osako, Miho', 'Itsumi, Momoe', 'Yamaguchi, Haruka', 'Takeuchi, Hiroaki', 'Yamaoka, Shoji']","['Osako M', 'Itsumi M', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Takeuchi H', 'Yamaoka S']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170828,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Domains', 'THP-1 Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*A20', '*NF-kappaB', '*cell differentiation', '*cell survival', '*macrophage', '*monocyte']",2017/08/05 06:00,2018/10/16 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.26308 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Feb;119(2):1475-1487. doi: 10.1002/jcb.26308.

BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated on the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol were eligible for two randomizations testing 6-mercaptopurine treatment intensifications to improve efficacy and Asparaginase de-escalation to reduce toxicity. We recently reported that while adolescents favoured treatment reduction, parents of young children favoured treatment intensification. DESIGN: A qualitative, exploratory study. METHODS: A maximum variation sampling strategy was used. Five adolescents aged 12-17 years, six parents of adolescents and five parents of children aged 1-12 years were interviewed in the period March-May 2015. Data were analysed using content analysis. FINDINGS: Adolescents and parents emphasized the importance of adolescents' active participation in decisions regarding enrolment into clinical trials. A majority of adolescents were either final or collaborative decision-makers. Parents stated that in case of disagreement, they would overrule the adolescents' decision. There were no differences between motivations of preferences held by parents of children or adolescents, respectively. Decisions were based on subjective values attributed to cure contra toxicity and individual preferences for either standard or experimental treatment. The possibility of a negative outcome induced fear of decisional regret and distress by the parents, yet they invested considerable trust in the physician's expertise. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of adolescents' active involvement in consent conferences. Research on management of disagreements between adolescents and parents in trial decisions is needed.","['Ingersgaard, Marianne Vie', 'Tulstrup, Morten', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Larsen, Hanne Baekgaard']","['Ingersgaard MV', 'Tulstrup M', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Larsen HB']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen and the Pediatric Clinic, Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20170910,England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Patient Participation', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Survival Rate', 'Uncertainty']",['NOTNLM'],"['adolescents', 'cancer', 'decision-making', 'nursing research', 'paediatrics']",2017/08/05 06:00,2018/08/08 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jan.13407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2018 Jan;74(1):110-118. doi: 10.1111/jan.13407.

MED12 mutations have been previously linked to aberrant Cyclin C-CDK8 kinase activity, but the exact oncogenic function in CLL is unknown. Here, we characterized MED12 mutations in CLL and identified recurrent mutations in 13 out of 188 CLL patients (6.9%), which clustered in the N-terminus. MED12 mutations were associated with unmutated IGHV (P = 0.024). Protein analysis of NOTCH1 in primary CLL samples revealed increased levels of NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD), the active form of NOTCH1, in the context of MED12 mutations. We found evidence that NICD is the target of Cyclin C-CDK8 kinase using a specific CDK8 inhibitor. In line with these findings, MED12 mutations were mutually exclusive to mutations in NOTCH1 in CLL, based on a meta-analysis of 1429 CLL patients (P = 0.011). Our results suggest that MED12 mutations may contribute to CLL pathogenesis by activating NOTCH signalling.","['Wu, Bian', 'Slabicki, Mikolaj', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Liu, Xiyang', 'Jethwa, Alexander', 'Hullein, Jennifer', 'Walther, Tatjana', 'Wagner, Lena', 'Huang, Zhiqin', 'Zapatka, Marc', 'Zenz, Thorsten']","['Wu B', 'Slabicki M', 'Sellner L', 'Dietrich S', 'Liu X', 'Jethwa A', 'Hullein J', 'Walther T', 'Wagner L', 'Huang Z', 'Zapatka M', 'Zenz T']","['Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology & Department of Translational Oncology, National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) and German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170802,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (MED12 protein, human)', '0 (Mediator Complex)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mediator Complex/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['* MED12', '*NOTCH signalling', '*cancer genetics', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*somatic mutation']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/31 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14869 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Nov;179(3):421-429. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14869.

Currently, small molecules mimicking the IAP-antagonizing activity of endogenous second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) are evaluated in phase 1/2 clinical trials. In cancer cells, SMAC mimetic (SM)-mediated IAP depletion induces tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion and simultaneously sensitizes for TNF-induced cell death. However, tumor cells lacking SM-induced autocrine TNF release survive and thus limit therapeutic efficacy. Here, we show that hyperosmotic stress boosts SM cytotoxicity in human and murine cells through hypertonicity-induced upregulation of TNF with subsequent induction of apoptosis and/or necroptosis. Hypertonicity allowed robust TNF-dependent killing in SM-treated human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, which under isotonic conditions resisted SM treatment due to poor SM-induced TNF secretion. Mechanistically, hypertonicity-triggered TNF release bypassed the dependency on SM-induced TNF production to execute SM cytotoxicity, effectively reducing the role of SM to TNF-sensitizing, but not necessarily TNF-inducing agents. Perspectively, these findings could extend the clinical application of SM.","['Bittner, Sebastian', 'Knoll, Gertrud', 'Ehrenschwender, Martin']","['Bittner S', 'Knoll G', 'Ehrenschwender M']","['Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee 11, Regensburg 93053, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee 11, Regensburg 93053, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee 11, Regensburg 93053, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170803,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Diablo protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', '*Biomimetic Materials/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cytotoxins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', '*Mitochondrial Proteins', '*Osmotic Pressure']",,,2017/08/05 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017355 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.355 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Aug 3;8(8):e2967. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.355.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4681-8628'],PMC5596546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specific examples of NKG2D and Erb-B are used that provide different characteristics and target profiles for CAR T-cell therapy of cancer.","['Gilham, David E', 'Maher, John']","['Gilham DE', 'Maher J']","['Research & Development, Celyad S.A., Axis Business Park, Rue Edouard Belin 2, B-1435 Mont Saint Guibert, Belgium.', ""King's College London, Division of Cancer Studies, Guy's Hospital, Great Maze Pond, London SE1 9RT, UK."", ""Department of Clinical Immunology & Allergy, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, UK."", 'Department of Immunology, Eastbourne Hospital, Kings Drive, Eastbourne, East Sussex, BN21 2UD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170803,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR', '*ErbB', '*NKG2D', '*T cell receptor', '*cancer', '*engineering', '*ligand']",2017/08/05 06:00,2018/05/11 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/imt-2017-0045 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2017 Aug;9(9):723-733. doi: 10.2217/imt-2017-0045.

We performed a retrospective study of 77 WM patients with biopsy-proven transformation to DLBCL. The median time from WM diagnosis to HT was 4.6 years and 16 patients (21%) had never been treated for WM. At HT, extranodal sites were observed in 91% of patients with a rather high incidence of central nervous system, cutaneous or testicular involvement. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography was performed in half of the patients and the median maximum standardized uptake value was 15 for transformed disease. More than 80% of cases with available data for assessment by the Hans' algorithm harboured a non-germinal centre B-cell phenotype. First-line treatment for transformation consisted of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)-like regimen in 85% of patients. The overall response rate after first-line treatment was 61% and the median overall survival was only 16 months for the entire cohort. Time to transformation above 5 years (P = 0.0004) and elevated LDH (P = 0.02) were associated with worse outcome. Based on these findings, HT should be considered and lead to a biopsy in WM patients presenting with extranodal involvement, elevated LDH and constitutional symptoms. The optimal therapeutic approaches remain to be defined.","['Durot, Eric', 'Tomowiak, Cecile', 'Michallet, Anne-Sophie', 'Dupuis, Jehan', 'Hivert, Benedicte', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Toussaint, Elise', 'Godet, Sophie', 'Merabet, Fatiha', 'Van Den Neste, Eric', 'Ivanoff, Sarah', 'Roussel, Xavier', 'Zini, Jean-Marc', 'Regny, Caroline', 'Lemal, Richard', 'Sutton, Laurent', 'Perrot, Aurore', 'Le Du, Katell', 'Kanagaratnam, Lukshe', 'Morel, Pierre', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Delmer, Alain']","['Durot E', 'Tomowiak C', 'Michallet AS', 'Dupuis J', 'Hivert B', 'Lepretre S', 'Toussaint E', 'Godet S', 'Merabet F', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Ivanoff S', 'Roussel X', 'Zini JM', 'Regny C', 'Lemal R', 'Sutton L', 'Perrot A', 'Le Du K', 'Kanagaratnam L', 'Morel P', 'Leblond V', 'Delmer A']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Reims and UFR Medecine, Reims, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Leon Berard Centre, Lyon, France.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Unit, Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital of Lens, Lens, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Henri Becquerel Centre, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Reims and UFR Medecine, Reims, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Andre Mignot Hospital, Versailles, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Saint-Luc Hospital, University Catholic of Leuven, Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Amiens, Amiens, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Grenoble, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital of Argenteuil, Argenteuil, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Clinique Victor Hugo, Le Mans, France.', 'Department of Research and Innovation, University Hospital of Reims, Reims, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Amiens, Amiens, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, UPMC Paris, Grechy, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Reims and UFR Medecine, Reims, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170802,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/methods', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/diagnostic imaging/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia', '*chemoimmunotherapy', '*diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', '*extranodal involvement', '*histological transformation']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/31 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14881 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Nov;179(3):439-448. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14881.

METHODS: Analyses involved 779,978 males and 1,032,868 females diagnosed with 1 of 13 cancer types between 2000 and 2008, and followed through 2013. Data are from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race, and tumor stage. RESULTS: Five-year relative survival conditional on years already survived is higher among married patients with less lethal cancers (oral cavity and pharynx, colon and rectum, breast, urinary bladder, kidney and renal pelvis, melanoma of the skin, thyroid, lymphoma). For more lethal cancers, married patients have similar (liver, lung and bronchus, pancreas, leukemia) or poorer (brain and other nervous system) cancer survival. Separated/divorced or widowed patients have the lowest conditional relative survival rates. For most cancers, 5-year cancer relative survival rates conditional on time already survived through 5 years approach 70 to 90% of that for the general population. The beneficial effect of marriage on survival decreases with years already survived. Superior conditional relative survival rates in females decrease with time already survived and are less pronounced in married patients. CONCLUSION: Five-year relative survival rates improve with time already survived. The benefits of marriage on conditional relative survival are greater for less lethal cancers. Greater 5-year conditional relative survival rates in females narrow with time already survived and are less pronounced in married patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Conditional relative survival rates of cancer can lead to more informed decisions and understanding regarding treatment and prognosis.","['Merrill, Ray M', 'Johnson, Erin']","['Merrill RM', 'Johnson E']","['Department of Health Science, College of Life Sciences, Brigham Young University, 2063 Life Sciences Building, Provo, UT, 84604, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the influence of suspected individual risk factors for ALL on the association between UV and PBC-ALL, and evaluated this association at the residence at birth. METHODS: Individual data collected by interviews in the ESCALE (2003-2004) and ESTELLE (2010-2011) nationwide case-control studies, which included 1,511 cases of leukemia aged less than 15 years and 3,102 population controls, were analyzed. Municipalities of residences at birth and at diagnosis/interview were extracted and assigned UV radiation exposure from the EUROSUN database. The potential confounders or effect modifiers considered were strongly suspected risk factors for ALL that were available in the ESCALE and ESTELLE studies. RESULTS: UV exposure at diagnosis was associated with PBC-ALL (OR = 1.27 [1.08-1.48]) for UV > 105.5 J/cm(2) compared to UV </= 105.5 J/cm(2). Considering exposure to UV at birth rather than at diagnosis/inclusion yielded almost identical results as both variables were strongly correlated. Taking into account the suspected ALL risk factors did not affect this association in the pooled study. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that our previous observation of an ecological association between residential UV radiation exposure at diagnosis and PBC-ALL was not confounded or modified by individual risk factors, and that the critical exposure time window may be prenatal.","['Coste, Astrid', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Boniol, Mathieu', 'Dore, Jean-Francois', 'Faure, Laure', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Goujon, Stephanie']","['Coste A', 'Hemon D', 'Orsi L', 'Boniol M', 'Dore JF', 'Faure L', 'Clavel J', 'Goujon S']","['Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Research Group (EPICEA), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, 75014, Paris, France. astrid.coste@inserm.fr.', 'Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Research Group (EPICEA), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, 75014, Paris, France.', 'Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Research Group (EPICEA), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, 75014, Paris, France.', 'University of Strathclyde Institute of Global Public Health at iPRI, International Prevention Research Institute, Lyon, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Lyon (CRCL), INSERM, UMR 1052 CNRS 52B6, Centre Leon Berard, 28 rue Laennec, 69373, Lyon Cedex 08, France.', 'Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Research Group (EPICEA), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, 75014, Paris, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Hematological Malignancies (NRCH), Villejuif, France.', 'Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Research Group (EPICEA), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, 75014, Paris, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Hematological Malignancies (NRCH), Villejuif, France.', 'Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Research Group (EPICEA), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, 75014, Paris, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Hematological Malignancies (NRCH), Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', '*Radiation Exposure', 'Risk Factors', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Children', 'Hematological malignancies', 'Sun exposure', 'Ultraviolet radiation']",2017/08/05 06:00,2018/05/18 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10552-017-0936-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-017-0936-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2017 Oct;28(10):1075-1083. doi: 10.1007/s10552-017-0936-5.

While BLV is known to cause lymphosarcomas, only 5% or fewer infected cattle will develop lymphoma; this low prevalence of cancer has historically not been a concern to dairy producers. However, more recent research has found that BLV(+) cows without lymphoma produce less milk and have shorter lifespans than uninfected herdmates. It has been hypothesized that BLV infection interferes with normal immune function in infected cattle, and this could lead to reduced dairy production. To assess how naturally infected BLV(+) cows responded to a primary and secondary immune challenge, 10 BLV(+) and 10 BLV(-) cows were injected subcutaneously with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide. B- and T-cell responses were characterized over the following 28 days. A total of 56 days after primary KLH exposure, cows were re-injected with KLH and B- and T-cell responses were characterized again over the following 28 days. BLV(+) cows produced less KLH-specific IgM after primary immune stimulation; demonstrated fewer CD45R0(+) B cells, altered proportions of CD5(+) B cells, altered expression of CD5 on CD5(+) B cells, and reduced MHCII surface expression on B cells ex vivo; exhibited reduced B-cell activation in vitro; and displayed an increase in BLV proviral load after KLH exposure. In addition, BLV(+) cows had a reduced CD45R0(+)gammadelta(+) T-cell population in the periphery and demonstrated a greater prevalence of IL4-producing T cells in vitro. All together, our results demonstrate that both B- and T-cell immunities are disrupted in BLV(+) cows and that antigen-specific deficiencies can be detected in BLV(+) cows even after a primary immune exposure.","['Frie, Meredith C', 'Sporer, Kelly R B', 'Benitez, Oscar J', 'Wallace, Joseph C', 'Droscha, Casey J', 'Bartlett, Paul C', 'Coussens, Paul M']","['Frie MC', 'Sporer KRB', 'Benitez OJ', 'Wallace JC', 'Droscha CJ', 'Bartlett PC', 'Coussens PM']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Comparative Medicine and Integrative Biology Program, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'NorthStar Cooperative, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170714,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD45R0', 'CD5+ B cells', 'IFNgamma', 'IL4', 'antibody', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'gamma delta T cells', 'memory']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/08/05 06:01,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fvets.2017.00112 [doi]'],epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2017 Jul 14;4:112. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2017.00112. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5509956,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CSF was administered in doses of 5 microg/kg of body weight within 24 hours of completion of chemotherapy for 7 days in 6 patients and for 10 days in others. Twenty six age and sex matched patients of ALL were included as controls. In the CSF group, incidence of severe neutropenia (grades 3 and 4) reduced significantly by 42.3 per cent though overall incidence of neutropenia did not differ much. Mean duration of neutropenia reduced by 4 days. Nadir total leucocyte count and absolute neutrophil count were significantly higher. There was no difference in the incidence of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and requirement of blood transfusions. Overall infections were less and incidence of severe infections reduced by 42.3 per cent. The duration of infection and of fever was shortened. Requirement of antibiotics was also reduced. All patients in CSF group recovered from infection, while 1 patient died in the control group. Mean duration of delay in chemotherapy was reduced from 10 days in control group to 3 days in CSF group. CSF administration resulted in an escalation of the cost by 112.24 per cent. However shortened duration of antibiotics, hospitalisation, reduced laboratory expenses compensated it by 66.94 per cent Our study indicates that the prophylactic use of CSF is beneficial and cost effective in moderately intensive chemotherapy with a high incidence of febrile neutropenia. Administration for 10 days appears to be more beneficial than 7 days.","['Rao, R Ranga', 'Sarma, Y S', 'Gupta, R K', 'Malik, R K']","['Rao RR', 'Sarma YS', 'Gupta RK', 'Malik RK']","['Classified specialist (Medicine and Oncology), Command Hospital (SC), Pune 41 1040.', 'Classified specialist (Medicine and Oncology), Command Hospital (SC), Pune 41 1040.', 'Post graduate Trainee in Paediatrics, Command Hospital (SC), Pune 41 1040.', 'Classified specialist (Paediatrics), Command Hospital (SC), Pune 41 1040.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170626,India,Med J Armed Forces India,"Medical journal, Armed Forces India",7602492,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Colony Stimulating Factors', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Neutropenia', 'Prophylaxis']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S0377-1237(17)30712-8 [doi]', 'S0377-1237(17)30712-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Med J Armed Forces India. 1997 Jul;53(3):183-188. doi: 10.1016/S0377-1237(17)30712-8.

The utility of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis and classification of acute leukaemias is well established. This diagnostic utility relates primarily to two points : firstly the distinction between acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and secondly to subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Leukaemic cells were immunophenotyped using the alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase techniques. The monoclonal antibodies were very useful in distinguishing cases of acute myeloid leukaemia from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with CD10 positivity showed a better prognosis. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was uncommon and was associated with unfavourable prognosis.

Heme, synthesized from porphyrin precursors, plays a central role in oxygen metabolism and mitochondrial function, yet little is known about its role in leukemogenesis. Here, we show increased expression of heme biosynthetic genes, including UROD, only in pediatric AML samples that have high MYCN expression. High expression of both UROD and MYCN predicts poor overall survival and unfavorable outcomes in adult AML. Murine leukemic progenitors derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) overexpressing a MYCN cDNA (MYCN-HPCs) require heme/porphyrin biosynthesis, accompanied by increased oxygen consumption, to fully engage in self-renewal and oncogenic transformation. Blocking heme biosynthesis reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and markedly suppressed self-renewal. Leukemic progenitors rely on balanced production of heme and heme intermediates, the porphyrins. Porphyrin homeostasis is required because absence of the porphyrin exporter, ABCG2, increased death of leukemic progenitors in vitro and prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with Abcg2-KO MYCN-HPCs. Pediatric AML patients with elevated MYCN mRNA display strong activation of TP53 target genes. Abcg2-KO MYCN-HPCs were rescued from porphyrin toxicity by p53 loss. This vulnerability was exploited to show that treatment with a porphyrin precursor, coupled with the absence of ABCG2, blocked MYCN-driven leukemogenesis in vivo, thereby demonstrating that porphyrin homeostasis is a pathway crucial to MYCN leukemogenesis.","['Fukuda, Yu', 'Wang, Yao', 'Lian, Shangli', 'Lynch, John', 'Nagai, Shinjiro', 'Fanshawe, Bruce', 'Kandilci, Ayten', 'Janke, Laura J', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Sorrentino, Brian P', 'Roussel, Martine F', 'Grosveld, Gerard', 'Schuetz, John D']","['Fukuda Y', 'Wang Y', 'Lian S', 'Lynch J', 'Nagai S', 'Fanshawe B', 'Kandilci A', 'Janke LJ', 'Neale G', 'Fan Y', 'Sorrentino BP', 'Roussel MF', 'Grosveld G', 'Schuetz JD']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Genetics.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology.', 'Department of Computational Biology.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', ""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Genetics.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170803,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,,,,['NOTNLM'],['Metabolism'],2017/08/05 06:00,2017/08/05 06:01,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:01 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['92409 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.92409 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2017 Aug 3;2(15). pii: 92409. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.92409. eCollection 2017 Aug 3.,"['P01 CA096832/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA194057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5543914,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, we previously found in the mouse Friend retrovirus (FV) model that Ad-based immunization did not induce CD8(+) T cell responses to the FV Leader-Gag-derived immunodominant epitope GagL85-93 We show now that induction of GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cells was highly effective when leader-Gag was delivered by plasmid DNA immunization, implying a role for Ad-derived epitopes in mediating unresponsiveness. By immunizing with DNA constructs encoding strings of GagL85-93 and the two Ad-derived epitopes DNA-binding protein418-426 (DBP418-426) and hexon486-494, we confirmed that Ad epitopes prevent induction of GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, while DBP418-426 did not interfere with GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cell induction, the H-2D(d)-restricted hexon486-494 suppressed the CD8(+) T cell response to the H-2D(b)-restricted GagL85-93 strongly in H-2(b/d) mice but not in H-2(b/b) mice. This finding indicates that competition occurs at the level of responding CD8(+) T cells, and we could indeed demonstrate that coimmunization with an interleukin 2 (IL-2)-encoding plasmid restored GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cell responses to epitope strings in the presence of hexon486-494 IL-2 codelivery did not restore GagL85-93 responsiveness in Ad-based immunization, however, likely due to the presence of further epitopes in the Ad vector. Our findings show that seemingly immunodominant transgene epitopes can be dominated by Ad-derived epitopes. These findings underline the importance of thorough characterization of vaccine vectors, and modifications of vectors or immunogens may be required to prevent impaired transgene-specific immune responses.IMPORTANCE Ad-based vectors are widely used in experimental preclinical and clinical immunization studies against numerous infectious agents, such as human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola virus, Plasmodium falciparum, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis Preexisting immunity to Ad-based vectors is widely recognized as a hindrance to the widespread use of Ad-based vectors for immunizations in humans; however, our data show that an immune response to Ad-derived T cell epitopes can also result in loss or impairment of transgene-specific immune responses in prenaive vaccinees due to immune competition. Our results highlight that seemingly immunodominant epitopes may be affected by dominance of vector-derived epitopes, and modifications of the vector design or the immunogens employed in immunization may lead to more effective vaccines.","['Schone, Dominik', 'Hrycak, Camilla Patrizia', 'Windmann, Sonja', 'Lapuente, Dennis', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Tenbusch, Matthias', 'Bayer, Wibke']","['Schone D', 'Hrycak CP', 'Windmann S', 'Lapuente D', 'Dittmer U', 'Tenbusch M', 'Bayer W']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Institute for Microbiology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Institute for Microbiology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany wibke.bayer@uni-due.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170927,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/immunology', 'Adenovirus Vaccines/immunology', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunization', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics/immunology', '*Transgenes', 'Vaccines, DNA/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Friend virus', '*adenovirus', '*immunization', '*immunodominance', '*retrovirus', '*vaccine', '*vector']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01184-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01184-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Sep 27;91(20). pii: JVI.01184-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01184-17.

Type I interferons alpha and beta (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) are key cytokines involved in innate immunity, and IFN-alpha, in combination with other antivirals, is extensively used in the treatment of HTLV-1 infection. The relationship between HTLV-1 and IFN signaling is unclear, and to date the effect of HBZ on this pathway has not been examined. Here we report that HBZ significantly enhances interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-induced IFN-alpha- and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activities and IFN-alpha production and can counteract the inhibitory effect of Tax1. In contrast to this, we show that HBZ and Tax1 cooperate to inhibit the induction of IFN-beta and ISRE promoters by IRF3 and IFN-beta production. In addition, we reveal that HBZ enhances ISRE activation by IFN-alpha. We further show that HBZ enhances IRF7 and suppresses IRF3 activation by TBK1 and IKKepsilon. We demonstrate that HBZ has no effect on virus-induced nuclear accumulation of IRF3, suggesting that it may inhibit IRF3 activity at a transcriptional level. We show that HBZ physically interacts with IRF7 and IKKepsilon but not with IRF3 or TBK1. Overall, our findings suggest that both HBZ and Tax1 are negative regulators of immediate early IFN-beta innate immune responses, while HBZ but not Tax1 positively regulates the induction of IFN-alpha and downstream IFN-alpha signaling.IMPORTANCE Type I interferons are powerful antiviral cytokines and are used extensively in the treatment of HTLV-1-induced adult T cell leukemia (ATL). To date, the relationship between HTLV-1 and the IFN pathway is poorly understood, and studies so far have focused on Tax1. Our study is unique in that it examined the effect of HBZ, alone or in combination with Tax1, on type I IFN signaling. This is important because HBZ is frequently the only viral protein expressed in infected cells, particularly at later stages of infection. A better understanding of the how HBZ regulates IFN signaling may lead to the development of therapeutics that can modify such responses and improve the clinical outcome for infected individuals.","['Narulla, Manraj Singh', 'Alsairi, Ahlam', 'Charmier, Lucie', 'Noonan, Stephen', 'Conroy, David', 'Hall, William W', 'Sheehy, Noreen']","['Narulla MS', 'Alsairi A', 'Charmier L', 'Noonan S', 'Conroy D', 'Hall WW', 'Sheehy N']","['Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland noreen.sheehy@ucd.ie.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170927,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (IRF3 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-7)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TBK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/immunology/metabolism', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/metabolism', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-7/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/immunology/*metabolism', 'Interferon-beta/immunology/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*IRF3', '*IRF7', '*Tax1', '*interferons']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00853-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00853-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Sep 27;91(20). pii: JVI.00853-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00853-17.

We discovered a new recombinant feline leukemia virus (FeLV) gag gene harboring an unrelated insertion, termed the X region, which was derived from Felis catus endogenous gammaretrovirus 4 (FcERV-gamma4). The identified FcERV-gamma4 proviruses have lost their coding capabilities, but some can express their viral RNA in feline tissues. Although the X-region-carrying recombinant FeLVs appeared to be replication-defective viruses, they were detected in 6.4% of tested FeLV-infected cats. All isolated recombinant FeLV clones commonly incorporated a middle part of the FcERV-gamma4 5'-leader region as an X region. Surprisingly, a sequence corresponding to the portion contained in all X regions is also present in at least 13 endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) observed in the cat, human, primate, and pig genomes. We termed this shared genetic feature the commonly shared (CS) sequence. Despite our phylogenetic analysis indicating that all CS-sequence-carrying ERVs are classified as gammaretroviruses, no obvious closeness was revealed among these ERVs. However, the Shannon entropy in the CS sequence was lower than that in other parts of the provirus genome. Notably, the CS sequence of human endogenous retrovirus T had 73.8% similarity with that of FcERV-gamma4, and specific signals were detected in the human genome by Southern blot analysis using a probe for the FcERV-gamma4 CS sequence. Our results provide an interesting evolutionary history for CS-sequence circulation among several distinct ancestral viruses and a novel recombined virus over a prolonged period.IMPORTANCE Recombination among ERVs or modern viral genomes causes a rapid evolution of retroviruses, and this phenomenon can result in the serious situation of viral disease reemergence. We identified a novel recombinant FeLV gag gene that contains an unrelated sequence, termed the X region. This region originated from the 5' leader of FcERV-gamma4, a replication-incompetent feline ERV. Surprisingly, a sequence corresponding to the X region is also present in the 5' portion of other ERVs, including human endogenous retroviruses. Scattered copies of the ERVs carrying the unique genetic feature, here named the commonly shared (CS) sequence, were found in each host genome, suggesting that ancestral viruses may have captured and maintained the CS sequence. More recently, a novel recombinant FeLV hijacked the CS sequence from inactivated FcERV-gamma4 as the X region. Therefore, tracing the CS sequences can provide unique models for not only the modern reservoir of new recombinant viruses but also the genetic features shared among ancient retroviruses.","['Kawasaki, Junna', 'Kawamura, Maki', 'Ohsato, Yoshiharu', 'Ito, Jumpei', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Kawasaki J', 'Kawamura M', 'Ohsato Y', 'Ito J', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Kahotechno Co., Ltd., Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Human Genetics, Department of Integrated Genetics, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan kaz@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170927,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Animals', 'Cats/virology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics', '*Genes, gag', '*Genome, Viral', 'Humans/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Feline/virology', 'Mammals/genetics/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Proviruses/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Swine/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ancestral virus', '*animals', '*cats', '*endogenous retrovirus', '*evolutionary biology', '*feline leukemia virus', '*genetic recombination']",2017/08/05 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00829-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00829-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Sep 27;91(20). pii: JVI.00829-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00829-17.

Targeting the prosurvival member MCL-1 has been an area of intense interest because it is frequently deregulated in cancer. In breast cancer, MCL-1 is often amplified, and high expression predicts poor patient outcome. We tested the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts with high expression of MCL-1. S63845 displayed synergistic activity with docetaxel in triple-negative breast cancer and with trastuzumab or lapatinib in HER2-amplified breast cancer. Using S63845-resistant cells combined with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) technology, we identified deletion of BAK and up-regulation of prosurvival proteins as potential mechanisms that confer resistance to S63845 in breast cancer. Collectively, our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of MCL-1 inhibitors in breast cancer.","['Merino, Delphine', 'Whittle, James R', 'Vaillant, Francois', 'Serrano,

A 1-day-old embryoid body (EB) received 5 ng/ml of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) for 4 days, 3 microM retinoic acid (RA) in a SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant (STO) co-culture system for 7 days, and was subsequently co-cultured for 2 days with Sertoli cells in the presence or absence of a leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and RA composition, and in the presence of these factors in simple culture medium. Higher viability, proliferation and germ cell gene expression were seen in the presence of the LIF, bFGF and RA composition, on top of Sertoli cells.

Overload or muscle contractions can induce a transient increase in muscle IL-6 and LIF expression, which has a regulatory role in muscle hypertrophy. However, the cellular mechanisms involved in this regulation have not been completely identified. The induction of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent myofiber protein synthesis is an established regulator of muscle hypertrophy, but the involvement of the IL-6 family of cytokines in this process is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the acute effects of IL-6 and LIF administration on mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis in C2C12 myotubes. The role of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) receptor and downstream signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mTORC1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), was investigated by administration of specific siRNA or pharmaceutical inhibitors. Acute administration of IL-6 and LIF induced protein synthesis, which was accompanied by STAT3 activation, Akt-mTORC1 activation, and increased SOCS3 expression. This induction of protein synthesis was blocked by both gp130 siRNA knockdown and Akt inhibition. Interestingly, STAT3 inhibition or Akt downstream mTORC1 signaling inhibition did not fully block the IL-6 or LIF induction of protein synthesis. SOCS3 siRNA knockdown increased basal protein synthesis and extended the duration of the protein synthesis induction by IL-6 and LIF. These results demonstrate that either IL-6 or LIF can activate gp130-Akt signaling axis, which induces protein synthesis via mTORC1-independent mechanisms in cultured myotubes. However, IL-6- or LIF-induced SOCS3 negatively regulates the activation of myotube protein synthesis.","['Gao, Song', 'Durstine, J Larry', 'Koh, Ho-Jin', 'Carver, Wayne E', 'Frizzell, Norma', 'Carson, James A']","['Gao S', 'Durstine JL', 'Koh HJ', 'Carver WE', 'Frizzell N', 'Carson JA']","['Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, School of Medicine, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuronscience, School of Medicine, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina; and.', 'Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina; carsonj@mailbox.sc.edu.', 'Center for Colon Cancer Research, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Posaconazole suspension is plagued by poor oral absorption and dietary requirements that are difficult for patients to meet. The delayed-release tablet formulation of posaconazole may be taken without regards to meals and has significantly better oral absorption than posaconazole suspension. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine if a switch to posaconazole tablets improved steady-state drug level attainment for invasive fungal infection prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: All adult inpatients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing chemotherapy, who received posaconazole for invasive fungal infection prophylaxis between 2012 and 2015, were included. The primary outcome was proportion of patients with first posaconazole level greater than 700 ng/mL. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with first posaconazole level greater than 1000 ng/mL, invasive fungal infection within 100 days, and adverse drug events. RESULTS: Forty patients received posaconazole tablets and 34 patients received suspension. Posaconazole levels were significantly higher at first measurement in patients receiving tablet than suspension (1296 ng/mL vs. 788 ng/mL, p < 0.01). Thirty-seven patients receiving tablets had a serum drug level greater than 700 ng/mL on first measurement versus 18 receiving suspension (p < 0.01). Patients receiving tablets were also more likely to have a serum drug level over 1000 ng/mL on first measurement (26 vs. 11, p < 0.01). Rates of invasive fungal infection and adverse events were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving posaconazole tablets attained significantly higher serum drug levels than those receiving suspension.","['Liebenstein, Tyler K', 'Widmer, Kristin M', 'Fallon, Michael J']","['Liebenstein TK', 'Widmer KM', 'Fallon MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin Health, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Tablets)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Compounding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Care Planning', 'Post-Exposure Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tablets', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Posaconazole', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'invasive fungal infection', 'leukemia']",2017/08/05 06:00,2019/01/01 06:00,['2017/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217722405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2018 Dec;24(8):599-603. doi: 10.1177/1078155217722405.

In this study, we aimed to conduct an investigation into the possible association between polymorphisms in these genes and ALL within a sample of Yemeni children of Arab-Asian descent. METHODS: Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF1, three SNPs in DDC, two SNPs in CDKN2A, two SNPs in CEBPE, and three SNPs in LMO1 were genotyped in 289 Yemeni children (136 cases and 153 controls), using the nanofluidic Dynamic Array (Fluidigm 192.24 Dynamic Array). Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate ALL risk, and the strength of association was expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We found that the IKZF1 SNP rs10235796 C allele (p = 0.002), the IKZF1 rs6964969 A>G polymorphism (p = 0.048, GG vs. AA), the CDKN2A rs3731246 G>C polymorphism (p = 0.047, GC+CC vs. GG), and the CDKN2A SNP rs3731246 C allele (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with ALL in Yemenis of Arab-Asian descent. In addition, a borderline association was found between IKZF1 rs4132601 T>G variant and ALL risk. No associations were found between the IKZF1 SNPs (rs11978267; rs7789635), DDC SNPs (rs3779084; rs880028; rs7809758), CDKN2A SNP (rs3731217), the CEBPE SNPs (rs2239633; rs12434881) and LMO1 SNPs (rs442264; rs3794012; rs4237770) with ALL in Yemeni children. CONCLUSION: The IKZF1 SNPs, rs10235796 and rs6964969, and the CDKN2A SNP rs3731246 (previously unreported) could serve as risk markers for ALL susceptibility in Yemeni children.","['Al-Absi, Boshra', 'Razif, Muhammad F M', 'Noor, Suzita M', 'Saif-Ali, Riyadh', 'Aqlan, Mohammed', 'Salem, Sameer D', 'Ahmed, Radwan H', 'Muniandy, Sekaran']","['Al-Absi B', 'Razif MFM', 'Noor SM', 'Saif-Ali R', 'Aqlan M', 'Salem SD', 'Ahmed RH', 'Muniandy S']","['1 Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Malaya , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia .', '1 Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Malaya , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia .', '2 Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia .', ""3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Sana'a University , Sana'a, Yemen ."", ""4 Department of Pediatrics, Al-Kuwait University Hospital , Sana'a, Yemen ."", ""3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Sana'a University , Sana'a, Yemen ."", '1 Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Malaya , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia .', '5 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, MAHSA University , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CDKN2A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 4.1.1.28 (Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases)', 'EC 4.1.1.28 (DDC protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases/genetics', 'Asians/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Yemen']",['NOTNLM'],"['CDK2NA', 'CEBPE', 'DDC', 'IKZF1', 'LMO1', 'childhood leukemia']",2017/08/03 06:00,2018/02/07 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2017.0084 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2017 Oct;21(10):592-599. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2017.0084.

Given the shortage of PPC physicians and the immediate need for PPC medical education, this study reports the outcomes of a problem-based learning (PBL) module facilitated by academic general and subspecialty pediatric faculty (non-PPC specialists) to third year medical students. Objectives/Setting: To test the effectiveness of a PPC-PBL module on third year medical students' and pediatric faculty's declarative knowledge, attitudes toward, perceived exposure, and self-assessed competency in PPC objectives. DESIGN: A PBL module was developed using three PPC learning objectives as a framework: define core concepts in palliative care; list the components of a total pain assessment; and describe key principles in establishing therapeutic relationships with patients. A PPC physician and nurse practitioner guided pediatric faculty on facilitating the PPC-PBL. In Part 1, students identified domains of palliative care for a child with refractory leukemia and self-assigned questions to research and present at the follow-up session. In Part 2, students were expected to develop a care plan demonstrating the three PPC objectives. MEASUREMENTS: Measures included a knowledge exam and a survey instrument to assess secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Students' declarative knowledge, perceived exposure, and self-assessed competency in all three PPC learning objectives improved significantly after the PPC-PBL, p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively. There were no significant differences in faculty knowledge test scores from baseline to follow-up, but scores were generally high (median >80%). Students and faculty rated palliative care education as ""important or very important"" at baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that key concepts in PPC can be taught to medical students utilizing a PBL format and pediatric faculty resulting in improved knowledge and self-assessed competency in PPC.","['Moody, Karen', 'McHugh, Marlene', 'Baker, Rebecca', 'Cohen, Hillel', 'Pinto, Priya', 'Deutsch, Stephanie', 'Santizo, Ruth O', 'Schechter, Miriam', 'Fausto, James', 'Joo, Pablo']","['Moody K', 'McHugh M', 'Baker R', 'Cohen H', 'Pinto P', 'Deutsch S', 'Santizo RO', 'Schechter M', 'Fausto J', 'Joo P']","['1 Department of Pediatrics, Montefiore Medical Center , Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', '2 Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx, New York.', '3 Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine , Indianapolis, Indiana.', '4 Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx, New York.', '2 Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx, New York.', '1 Department of Pediatrics, Montefiore Medical Center , Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', '1 Department of Pediatrics, Montefiore Medical Center , Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', '1 Department of Pediatrics, Montefiore Medical Center , Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', '2 Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx, New York.', '2 Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170802,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,,IM,"['Curriculum', 'Humans', '*Palliative Care', 'Pediatrics/*education', '*Problem-Based Learning', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['*curriculum', '*medical', '*palliative care', '*pediatrics', '*problem-based learning', '*students']",2017/08/03 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jpm.2017.0154 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2018 Jan;21(1):22-27. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2017.0154.

Subsequent mutations at either stem cell or progenitor cell levels transform the PLSC into lymphoma/leukemia initiating cells (LIC). Thymic lymphomas have been thought to develop from developing thymocytes. T cell progenitors are generated from HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), but maturation and proliferation of T cells as well as T-lymphomagenesis depends on both regulatory mechanisms and microenvironment within the thymus. We studied PLSC linked to thymic lymphomas. In this study, we use MSH2-/- mice as a model to investigate the existence of PLSC and the evolution of PLSC to LIC. Following BM transplantation, we found that MSH2-/- BM cells from young mice are able to fully reconstitute multiple hematopoietic lineages of lethally irradiated wild-type recipients. However, all recipients developed thymic lymphomas within three and four months post transplantation. Transplantation of different fractions of BM cells or thymocytes from young health MSH2-/- mice showed that an HSC enriched fraction always reconstituted hematopoiesis followed by lymphoma development. In addition, lymphomas did not occur in thymectomized recipients of MSH2-/- BM. These results suggest that HSCs with DNA repair defects such as MSH2-/- are PLSCs because they retain hematopoietic function, but also carry an obligate lymphomagenic potential within their T-cell progeny that is dependent on the thymic microenvironment.","['Qing, Yulan', 'Gerson, Stanton L']","['Qing Y', 'Gerson SL']","['Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, National Center for Regenerative Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, National Center for Regenerative Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 3.6.1.3 (Msh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/*deficiency', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2017/08/03 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0182175 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-08561 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Aug 2;12(8):e0182175. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0182175. eCollection 2017.,"['P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8431-7800'],PMC5540588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A predose plasma imatinib concentration of >1 mg.L is associated with improved clinical response. This study aimed to assess the plasma imatinib and norimatinib concentrations attained in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia administered standard doses of imatinib adjusted for dose, age, sex, body weight, and response. METHODS: We evaluated data from a cohort of patients treated between 2008 and 2014 with respect to dose, age, sex, body weight, and response. RESULTS: The study comprised 438 samples from 93 patients (54 male, 39 female). The median imatinib dose was 400 mg.d in men and in women. The plasma imatinib concentration ranged 0.1-5.0 mg.L and was below 1 mg.L in 20% and 16% of samples from men and women, respectively. The mean dose normalized plasma imatinib and norimatinib concentrations were significantly higher in women in comparison with men. This was partially related to body weight. Mixed effects ordinal logistic regression showed no evidence of an association between sex and plasma imatinib (P = 0.13). However, there was evidence of an association between sex and plasma norimatinib, with higher norimatinib concentrations more likely in women than in men (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib therapeutic drug monitoring only provides information on dosage adequacy and on short-term adherence; longer-term adherence cannot be assessed. However, this analysis revealed that approximately 1 in 5 samples had a plasma imatinib concentration <1 mg.L, which was suggestive of inadequate dosage and/or poor adherence and posed a risk of treatment failure. Higher imatinib exposure in women may be a factor in the increased rate of long-term, stable, deep molecular response (undetectable breakpoint cluster-Abelson (BCR-ABL) transcript levels with a PCR sensitivity of 4.5 log, MR4.5) reported in women.","['Belsey, Sarah L', 'Ireland, Robin', 'Lang, Kathryn', 'Kizilors, Aytug', 'Ho, Aloysius', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Bisquera, Alessandra', 'De Lavallade, Hugues', 'Flanagan, Robert J']","['Belsey SL', 'Ireland R', 'Lang K', 'Kizilors A', 'Ho A', 'Mufti GJ', 'Bisquera A', 'De Lavallade H', 'Flanagan RJ']","[""*Toxicology Unit, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; daggerDepartment of Haematology, King's College London NHS Foundation Trust; and double daggerStatistician, Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*blood/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/08/03 06:00,2018/05/17 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FTD.0000000000000440 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2017 Oct;39(5):499-504. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000440.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the negative effect of DNMT3A on treatment outcome is well known, the prognostic significance of other DNMT3A mutations in AML is still unclear. Here, we tried to determine the incidence and prognostic significance of DNMT3A mutations in a large cohort in Chinese childhood AML. METHODS: We detected the mutations in DNMT3A exon 23 by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing in 342 children with AML (0-16 years old) from January 2005 to June 2013, treated on BCH-2003 AML protocol. The correlation of DNMT3A mutations with clinical characteristics, fusion genes, other molecular anomalies (FLT3 internal tandem duplication [FLT3-ITD], Nucleophosmin 1, C-KIT (KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase), and Wilms tumor 1 mutations), and treatment outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: DNMT3A mutations were detected in 4 out of 342 (1.2%) patients. Two patients were PML-RARA positive and 1 patient was FLT3-ITD positive. The mutations in coding sequences included S892S, V912A, R885G, and Q886R. Furthermore, there was 1 intronic mutation (c.2739+55A>C) found in 1 patient. No association of DNMT3A mutations with common clinical features was found. Two patients with DNMT3A mutations died of relapse or complications during treatment. One patient gave up treatment due to remission induction failure in day 33. Only 1 patient achieved continuous complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations were rare in Chinese children with AML including PML-RARA positive APL. The mutation positions were different from the hotspots reported in adult AML. DNMT3A mutations may have adverse impact on prognosis of children with AML.","['Li, Weijing', 'Cui, Lei', 'Gao, Chao', 'Liu, Shuguang', 'Zhao, Xiaoxi', 'Zhang, Ruidong', 'Zheng, Huyong', 'Wu, Minyuan', 'Li, Zhigang']","['Li W', 'Cui L', 'Gao C', 'Liu S', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang R', 'Zheng H', 'Wu M', 'Li Z']","[""Hematology & Oncology Laboratory, Beijing Pediatric Research Institute Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education Hematology & Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",,,2017/08/03 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000007620 [doi]', '00005792-201708040-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Aug;96(31):e7620. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000007620.,,,,PMC5626129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods Patients age 2 to 21 years with de novo APL confirmed by PML-RARalpha polymerase chain reaction were stratified as standard risk (SR) or high risk (HR) on the basis of diagnostic WBC count. All patients received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) during induction, each consolidation course, and maintenance. All patients received two cycles of ATO therapy during consolidation 1, an additional two (SR) or three (HR) consolidation courses that included high-dose cytarabine and anthracycline, and maintenance therapy comprising ATRA, oral methotrexate, and mercaptopurine. Results One hundred one patients (66 SR and 35 HR) were evaluable for outcome. The 3-year overall survival was 94%, and event-free survival (EFS) was 91%. For SR and HR patients with APL, the overall survival was 98% versus 86% ( P = .003), and EFS was 95% versus 83% ( P = .03), respectively. The EFS for SR patients in AAML0631 was noninferior to that of patients in the AIDA 0493 historical control, which used a significantly higher anthracycline dose and did not include ATO consolidation. Relapse risk for patients in AAML0631 from end consolidation 1 (after ATO treatment) was only 4% at 3 years and did not differ significantly between SR and HR patients. Conclusion ATO consolidation cycles were well tolerated in pediatric patients with APL and allowed significant reduction in cumulative anthracycline doses while maintaining excellent survival and a low relapse risk for both SR and HR patients with APL.","['Kutny, Matthew A', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Fu, Cecilia H', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Feusner, James H', 'Gregory, John J Jr']","['Kutny MA', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Wang YC', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch BA', 'Fu CH', 'Meshinchi S', 'Gamis AS', 'Feusner JH', 'Gregory JJ Jr']","[""Matthew A.

Importantly, the biological effects of Se compounds are exerted by their metabolites, with methylselenol (CH(3)SeH) being one of the key executors. In this study, we developed a new series of methylselenoesters with different scaffolds aiming to modulate the release of CH(3)SeH. The fifteen compounds follow Lipinski's Rule of Five and with exception of compounds 1 and 14, present better drug-likeness values than the positive control methylseleninic acid. The compounds were evaluated to determine their radical scavenging activity. Compound 11 reduced both DPPH and ABTS radicals. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated in a panel of five cancer cell lines (prostate, colon and lung carcinoma, mammary adenocarcinoma and chronic myelogenous leukemia) and two non-malignant (lung and mammary epithelial) cell lines. Ten compounds had GI50 values below 10 muM at 72 h in four cancer cell lines. Compounds 5 and 15 were chosen for further characterization of their mechanism of action in the mammary adenocarcinoma cell line due to their similarity with methylseleninic acid. Both compounds induced G(2)/M arrest whereas cell death was partially executed by caspases. The reduction and metabolism were also investigated, and both compounds were shown to be substrates for redox active enzyme thioredoxin reductase.","['Diaz-Argelich, Nuria', 'Encio, Ignacio', 'Plano, Daniel', 'Fernandes, Aristi P', 'Palop, Juan Antonio', 'Sanmartin, Carmen']","['Diaz-Argelich N', 'Encio I', 'Plano D', 'Fernandes AP', 'Palop JA', 'Sanmartin C']","['Department of Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Navarra, Irunlarrea 1, E-31008 Pamplona, Spain. ndiaz@alumni.unav.es.', 'Oncology and Hematology Section, IdiSNA, Navarra Institute for Health Research, Irunlarrea 3, E-31008 Pamplona, Spain. ndiaz@alumni.unav.es.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics (MBB), Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden. ndiaz@alumni.unav.es.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Public University of Navarra, Avda.

We report the unique case of a 33-year-old Italian woman with a combination of typical PCARP, sensory-autonomic neuropathy with sensory loss to all modalities and multiple autonomic dysfuctions, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Molecular analysis demonstrated homozygosity for the previously identified FLVCR1 p.Pro221Ser variation. The same variation, in combination with a frameshift mutation, was previously identified in an Italian child with HSAN. Functional studies carried out on patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines showed decreased FLVCR1a transcript, increased reactive oxygen species, excessive intracellular heme accumulation, and increased number of Annexin V positive cells. This indicates that the homozygous p.Pro221Ser FLVCR1 variation compromises the ability of FLVCR1a to export heme leading to enhanced susceptibility to programmed cell death. Our study demonstrates the existence of a phenotypic continuum among the discrete disorders previously linked to FLVCR1 mutations, and suggests that the related alteration of heme metabolism may lead to the degeneration of specific neuronal cell populations.","['Castori, Marco', 'Morlino, Silvia', 'Ungelenk, Martin', 'Pareyson, Davide', 'Salsano, Ettore', 'Grammatico, Paola', 'Tolosano, Emanuela', 'Kurth, Ingo', 'Chiabrando, Deborah']","['Castori M', 'Morlino S', 'Ungelenk M', 'Pareyson D', 'Salsano E', 'Grammatico P', 'Tolosano E', 'Kurth I', 'Chiabrando D']","['UOC Genetica Medica, IRCCS-Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo (Foggia), Italy.', 'Division/Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Department of Molecular Medicine, San Camillo-Forlanini Hospital, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, IRCCS Foundation C.

The present study was conducted to assess the prevalence of MDR bacteria in stool cultures of patients with acute leukaemia at presentation to the hospital. The results were then correlated with blood cultures when patients developed septicaemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved analysis of case records of patients with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia less than 18 years of age treated at our centre from January 2015 to December 2015. Stool cultures were sent within 72 hr of hospital admission and blood cultures were sent when clinically indicated. MDR was defined as resistance to at least one antibiotic in three or more following antimicrobial groups: cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. RESULTS: The analysis included 85 patients with acute leukaemia, among whom 48 of 85 (56%) patients had positive stool cultures and 42 of 85 (50%) patients were positive for MDR bacteria. Blood cultures were positive in 13 of 48 patients (27%, seven MDR and six non-MDR) with positive stool cultures and three of 37 patients (8%, one MDR and two non-MDR) with negative stool cultures (P = 0.01). The concordance between stool and blood culture for similar organism was 61%. There were seven deaths in 48 stool culture positive patients and two deaths in 37 stool culture negative patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows the high prevalence of MDR bacteria in newly diagnosed children with acute leukaemia. Colonisation with MDR bacteria in stools is associated with increased positivity of blood cultures and mortality.","['Shankar, Krupa', 'Radhakrishnan, Venkatraman', 'Vijayakumar, Varalakskmi', 'Ramamoorthy, Jaikumar', 'Ganesan, Prasanth', 'Dhanushkodi, Manikandan', 'Ganesan, T S', 'Sagar, T G']","['Shankar K', 'Radhakrishnan V', 'Vijayakumar V', 'Ramamoorthy J', 'Ganesan P', 'Dhanushkodi M', 'Ganesan TS', 'Sagar TG']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology and Microbiology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology and Microbiology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology and Microbiology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology and Microbiology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology and Microbiology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology and Microbiology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology and Microbiology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', '*Bacteria', '*Bacterial Infections/microbiology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Feces/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia/blood/microbiology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Prevalence']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukaemia', 'infection', 'multi-drug resistance', 'stool culture']",2017/08/03 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26740 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Jan;65(1). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26740.

In this study, the costs of an individualized and fixed asparaginase dosing schedule were compared. PROCEDURE: Patients, treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL-11 protocol (individualized PEGasparaginase treatment, starting dose: 1,500 IU/m(2) ) or ALL-10 protocol (native Escherichia coli asparaginase followed by 2,500 IU/m(2) PEGasparaginase), were included. To focus on TDM of PEGasparaginase, the costs were also calculated excluding patients treated with Erwinia asparaginase and compared to a hypothetical protocol with a fixed dose of 1,500 IU/m(2) PEGasparaginase. Direct asparaginase-related medical costs, including costs for asparaginase use (calculated with the absolute dose), TDM, laboratory tests, daycare treatment, and outpatient clinic visits, were calculated. RESULTS: Eighty-three ALL-10 patients and 51 ALL-11 patients were included. The asparaginase-related costs were 30.8% lower in ALL-11 than in ALL-10 ($29,048 vs. $41,960). The ALL-11 costs of nonallergic patients were 20.4% lower, when using TDM, than the hypothetical protocol with a fixed dose of 1,500 IU/m(2) ($13,178 vs. $16,551). TDM accounted for 12.4% of the costs. Including asparaginase waste, TDM in ALL-11 will be cost saving if three doses can be prepared out of one vial compared to a fixed dose of 1,500 IU/m(2) . CONCLUSIONS: TDM of asparaginase is cost saving if calculated with the absolute asparaginase dose and will be if the waste is minimalized by preparing multiple doses out of one vial.","['Kloos, Robin Q H', 'Uyl-de Groot, Carin A', 'van Litsenburg, Raphaele R L', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van der Sluis, Inge M']","['Kloos RQH', 'Uyl-de Groot CA', 'van Litsenburg RRL', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Pieters R', 'van der Sluis IM']","[""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Institute of Health Care Policy and Management/Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/economics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'asparaginase', 'cost analysis', 'therapeutic drug monitoring']",2017/08/03 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26651 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26651.

Undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are commonly seen in children from LMICs undergoing treatment for ALL. The present study examines the prevalence and clinical implications of folate deficiency in north Indian children with ALL during the maintenance phase of treatment in view of prolonged antifolate treatment and high population prevalence of folate deficiency. PROCEDURES: Pre-cycle folate levels/deficiency as well as weight for age z-score and serum albumin level were determined and correlated with complications of treatment and mortality encountered during the maintenance phase of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 52 children enrolled in the study had folate deficiency at some point during maintenance chemotherapy. Neutropenia (18 of 29 vs. 4 of 23; P = 0.002), thrombocytopenia (17 of 29 vs. 4 of 23; P = 0.005), febrile neutropenia (17 of 29 vs. 4 of 23; P = 0.005), and need for chemotherapy dose reduction (20 of 29 vs. 7 of 21; P = 0.01) were more common in folate-deficient children. Maintenance deaths were higher (8 of 29 vs. 1 of 23; P = 0.03) and survival lower (P = 0.02) in deficient children. In multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.02) and folate deficiency (P = 0.01) were associated with febrile neutropenia, and folate deficiency with maintenance deaths (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Folate deficiency was associated with treatment-related complications and adverse outcome in our patients. The risks and benefits of folate supplementation in deficient children during maintenance chemotherapy need to be explored with properly designed randomized studies in similar settings.","['Roy Moulik, Nirmalya', 'Kumar, Archana', 'Agrawal, Suraksha', 'Mahdi, Abbas Ali']","['Roy Moulik N', 'Kumar A', 'Agrawal S', 'Mahdi AA']","['Department of Paediatrics, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Greater London, United Kingdom.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."", 'Department of Medical Genetics, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', ""Department of Biochemistry, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Febrile Neutropenia/blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/blood/*mortality', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', '*Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL maintenance', 'clinical implications', 'folate deficiency']",2017/08/03 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26730 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Jan;65(1). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26730.

We aimed at explaining the molecular mechanism of green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) enhancement of ATRA-induced APL cell line differentiation. Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was found downregulated in NB4 cells and rescued by proteases inhibitor MG132. A significant increase of PTEN levels was found in NB4, HL-60 and THP-1 cells upon ATRA combined with EGCG treatment, paralleled by increased myeloid differentiation marker CD11b. EGCG in synergy with ATRA promote degradation of PML/RARalpha and restores PML expression, and increase the level of nuclear PTEN. Pretreatment of PTEN inhibitor SF1670 enhances the PI3K signaling pathway and represses NB4 cell differentiation. Moreover, the induction of PTEN attenuated the Akt phosphorylation levels, pretreatment of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in NB4 cells, significantly augmented the cell differentiation and increased the expression of PTEN. These results therefore indicate that EGCG targets PML/RARalpha oncoprotein for degradation and potentiates differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia cells in combination with ATRA via PTEN.","['Yao, Shifei', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Chen, Min', 'Zhao, Yi', 'Li, Lianwen', 'Liu, Lu', 'Xu, Ting', 'Xiao, Chunlan', 'Gan, Liugen', 'Shan, Zhiling', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Yao S', 'Zhong L', 'Chen M', 'Zhao Y', 'Li L', 'Liu L', 'Xu T', 'Xiao C', 'Gan L', 'Shan Z', 'Liu B']","['Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, P.R.

The combination of HCL and pregnancy was observed in 5 patients. The patients' median age was 35 years (range, 28-42 years). The diagnosis of HCL was based on a conventional examination protocol: clinical blood analysis with the morphological assessment of lymphocytes, a myelogram and trepanobiopsy, immunophenotypic analysis of lymphocytes or bone marrow (in all the patients), cytochemical determination of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase in 3 patients, and identification of BRAFV600E mutation in 3 patients. Three pregnant women were treated for HCL in the postpartum period. In one patient with HCL, pregnancy was seen in remission after treatment with cladribine. In one patient with HCL detected at 11 weeks' gestation, interferon-alpha therapy during the second trimester of pregnancy was performed for increased cytopenia, which was followed by cladribine therapy after delivery. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated in all the patients; 3 patients had vaginal delivery and 2 patients underwent cesarean section. All infants were healthy, with no developmental abnormalities during a follow-up period of 6-140 months (median 30 months). All the patients with HCL are currently in remission: 4 patients in first remission at a follow-up of 10 to 48 months (median 15 months) and one patient in second remission at a follow-up of 88 months. Possible observational tactics is possible when HCL is detected during pregnancy. Treatment of HCL during pregnancy is necessary in cases of deep or progressive cytopenia and/or splenomegaly. The use of interferon-alpha or splenectomy is preferable.","['Al-Radi, L S', 'Moiseeva, T N', 'Smirnova, S Yu', 'Shmakov, R G']","['Al-Radi LS', 'Moiseeva TN', 'Smirnova SY', 'Shmakov RG']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Acad.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The results of the Russian prospective observational multicenter study BEN-001 (2012-2015) covering 196 CLL patients from 34 centers of the Russian Federation were analyzed. The diagnosis was confirmed by the results of peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotyping. A centralized approach was employed to make IGHV gene mutational status analysis, FISH examination, and minimal residual disease according to standardized methods. Quality-of-life (QOL) indicators were estimated using the EQ-5D and FACT-Leu questionnaires. Survival rates were calculated applying by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 61 years. 41% of patients had a decline in estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m2. The combination of bendamustine and rituximab could achieve a common response in 83.2% of the patients, including complete remission in 59.7%. Eradication of minimal residual disease was achieved in 23 (27.4%) of 84 patients. Two-year progression-free survival rates were 85.9%. The QOL indicators were noted to be improved during the treatment. CONCLUSION: The investigation shows the good tolerability of bendamustine when it is used in clinical practice. Due to the high cost of new drugs (ibrutinib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, etc.) and toxicity of the FCR regimen, the combination including bendamustine can be the best first-line therapy option for all CLL patients, regardless of their age and comorbidity.","['Stadnik, E A', 'Strugov, V V', 'Andreeva, T O', 'Virts, Yu V', 'Rumyantsev, A M', 'Mirolyubova, Yu V', 'Butylin, P A', 'Zaritsky, A Yu']","['Stadnik EA', 'Strugov VV', 'Andreeva TO', 'Virts YV', 'Rumyantsev AM', 'Mirolyubova YV', 'Butylin PA', 'Zaritsky AY']","['Institute of Hematology, V.A.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to investigate the gene expression of VEGF-A, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 in the mononuclear cell fractions obtained from 24 patients with MDS. RESULTS: The expression of the 3 genes was identified in all the patients examined. There was the highest expression level of the VEGF-A gene (p<0.0001), whereas the expression of the VEGFR1 gene was higher than that of the VEGFR2 gene (p<0.001). The expression of the VEGF-A gene proved to be higher in patients at a higher risk of acute leukemia and positively correlated with the expression levels of the VEGFR1 gene (p<0.05) rather than that of the VEGFR2 gene. At the same time, patients with higher VEGFR1 gene expression had significantly lower overall survival rates (r=-0.5; p<0.05). Patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk acute leukemia showed an increase in the average expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR1 and a reduction in VEGFR2 expression.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The ALL-2009 (NCT01193933) study conducted in April 2009 to December 2016 included 194 patients (95 males and 99 females) aged 15 to 55 years (median age 28 years) with Ph-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). There was early pre-B-cell ALL in 54 patients, common ALL in 101, pre-B ALL in 39, initial leukocytosis in 9.4.109/l (0.4-899.0), lactate dehydrogenase in 901 IU (31-13 059), an initial central nervous system lesion in 17 (8.7%), mediastinal injury in 3 (1.5%), and splenomegaly in 111 (57.2%). The results of standard cytogenetic analysis are known in 113 (60.4%) patients. Normal karyotypes were detected in 49 (54.5%) out of the patients; t(4;11) in 9 (5.4%), t(1;19) in 2 (1.2%), and other karyotypic abnormalities in 53 (46.9%). Thirteen (7.8%) patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission (CR); their proportion did not differ in the federal and regional centers. RESULTS: The frequency of CR achievement was the same in the federal and regional centers and generally amounted to 87.5%. Early (8.8%) and CR (9.6%) mortality rates remained high despite the low aggressiveness of cytotoxic action, necessitating the improvement of auxiliary treatment. The five-year overall survival (OS) rates vary considerably in the federal and regional centers (72.6 and 43.8%), the relapse-free survival (RFS) (70.2 and 53.4%) and recurrence risk (23.1 and 36.5%) are comparable. This suggests that the non-intensive, but continuous exposure principle built in the ALL-2009 protocol makes it possible to reproduce the envisaged treatment program and to achieve satisfactory results. CONCLUSION: The ALL-2009 protocol allows both the federal and regional centers to obtain the long-term results comparable with those of current foreign studies: OS (54.2%), RFS (56.5%); and relapse risk (35.4%). Multivariate analysis has identified age (over 30 years), initial leukocytosis (30.109/l and more) and t(4;11) among the main clinical prognostic factors.

Global rates of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and RA are increasing, with a concomitant rise in individual and overall treatment costs. As such, biosimilar development may help facilitate greater access to treatment. The rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 (Truxima(R)) has recently received approval in Europe and South Korea for all indications held by reference rituximab (RTX). Areas covered: Here, the unmet needs and current market in the treatment of NHL, CLL and RA are outlined, followed by a comprehensive examination of the analytical, pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrating the equivalence and similarity of CT-P10 to RTX including with respect to pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Expert commentary: The rising treatment costs of NHL, CLL and RA pose a challenge to constrained healthcare budgets worldwide. Biosimilars may provide an effective solution to this conundrum. CT-P10 is equivalent to RTX in terms of efficacy and pharmacokinetics, and has a similar safety and immunogenicity profile. Approved in all indications held by RTX, CT-P10 has the potential to reduce treatment costs and thereby increase patient access to rituximab therapy.","['Coiffier, Bertrand']",['Coiffier B'],"['a Department of Hematology , Hospices Civils de Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud , Pierre-Benite , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170802,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Biosimilar', 'CT-P10', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'efficacy', ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'rituximab', 'safety']",2017/08/03 06:00,2017/09/05 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2017.1359537 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2017 Sep;10(9):923-933. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2017.1359537.

Our recent studies have uncovered that in pancreatic cancer, the KRAS mutation decreased FBW7 expression through phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination. Moreover, FBW7 inhibited aerobic glycolysis in pancreatic cancer via induction of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a mitochondrial localized tumor suppressor. The roles of FBW7 in anti-apoptosis and drug resistance via proteosomal degradation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), which is an anti-apoptotic factor have been reported. However, the role of FBW7 in the chemotherapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine has seldom been reported. In the present study, we demonstrated that overexpression of FBW7 in pancreatic cancer cells rendered increased sensitivity to gemcitabine. Mechanistically, FBW7 promoted gemcitabine sensitivity via upregulation of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) at the protein level rather than the transcriptional level. In depth analysis demonstrated that the ENT1 protein level could be increased by lysosome inhibition. Taken together, our results demonstrated that FBW7 could be a target for improving the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine by induction of ENT1.","['Hu, Qiangsheng', 'Qin, Yi', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Liang, Chen', 'Ji, Shunrong', 'Shi, Si', 'Xu, Wenyan', 'Xiang, Jinfeng', 'Liang, Dingkong', 'Ni, Quanxing', 'Yu, Xianjun', 'Xu, Jin']","['Hu Q', 'Qin Y', 'Zhang B', 'Liang C', 'Ji S', 'Shi S', 'Xu W', 'Xiang J', 'Liang D', 'Ni Q', 'Yu X', 'Xu J']","['Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai 200032, P.R.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve an important role in regulating gene expression through chromatin modification, transcription and posttranscriptional processing. LncRNA H19 was considered as an independent prognostic marker for patients with tumors. The expression of lncRNA H19 was identified to be significantly upregulated in bone marrow samples from patients with AMLM2. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the knockdown of lncRNA H19 resulted in increased expression of hsamicroRNA (miR)19a/b and decreased expression of inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2) in AML cells. The knockdown of lncRNA H19 inhibited the proliferation of AML cells in vitro, which could be partially reversed by ID2 overexpression. Furthermore, the results of the bioinformatic analysis revealed potential hsamiR19a/b3p binding sites in lncRNA H19 and ID2.

We previously identified a novel gene, namely lung cancer metastasis related protein 1 (LCMR1; GenBank accession no. AY148462), which was demonstrated to be overexpressed in nonsmallcell lung cancer. LCMR1 expression was significantly associated with clinical stage. To further understand the mechanism of LCMR1 in lung cancer, the present study screened a cDNA library from the lung cancer cell line 95D for proteins interacting with LCMR1 by yeast twohybrid assay, and the protein DEK was identified. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione Stransferase pulldown assays were performed to confirm the interaction between LCMR1 and DEK in vivo and in vitro. The results demonstrated that the interaction was mediated primarily by the Nterminal region of DEK, suggesting that LCMR1 may be involved in the regulation of cell apoptosis. Using RNA interference, DEK and LCMR1 were demonstrated to cooperate in the inhibition of apoptosis in lung cancer cells, and this effect was associated with the induced myeloid leukemia protein cell differentiation protein 1 pathway. The present findings suggest that LCMR1 might serve as a potential molecular target for lung cancer therapy.","['Xu, Yang', 'Liang, Zhixin', 'Li, Chunsun', 'Yang, Zhen', 'Chen, Liangan']","['Xu Y', 'Liang Z', 'Li C', 'Yang Z', 'Chen L']","['Department of Respiratory Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, P.R.

The expression of TEs is considered potentially hazardous, as it can lead to insertional mutagenesis and genomic instability. However, recent studies have revealed that TEs are involved in immune-mediated cell clearance. Hypomethylating agents can increase the expression of TEs in cancer cells, inducing 'viral mimicry', causing interferon signalling and cancer cell killing. To investigate the role of TEs in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we studied TE expression in several cell fractions of AML while tracking its development (pre-leukemic haematopoietic stem cells, leukemic stem cells [LSCs], and leukemic blasts). LSCs, which are resistant to chemotherapy and serve as reservoirs for relapse, showed significant suppression of TEs and interferon pathways. Similarly, high-risk cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) showed far greater suppression of TEs than low-risk cases. We propose TE suppression as a mechanism for immune escape in AML and MDS. Repression of TEs co-occurred with the upregulation of several genes known to modulate TE expression, such as RNA helicases and autophagy genes. Thus, we have identified potential pathways that can be targeted to activate cancer immunogenicity via TEs in AML and MDS.","['Colombo, Anthony R', 'Zubair, Asif', 'Thiagarajan, Devi', 'Nuzhdin, Sergey', 'Triche, Timothy J', 'Ramsingh, Giridharan']","['Colombo AR', 'Zubair A', 'Thiagarajan D', 'Nuzhdin S', 'Triche TJ', 'Ramsingh G']","['Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Los Angeles, California, 90033, USA.', 'University of Southern California, Department of Molecular and Computational Biology, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-2910, USA.', 'Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Los Angeles, California, 90033, USA.', 'Langone Medical Center of New York University School of Medicine, Endocrinology Division for the Study of Diabetes, 550 1st Avenue, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', 'University of Southern California, Department of Molecular and Computational Biology, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-2910, USA.', 'Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Los Angeles, California, 90033, USA. tim.triche@gmail.com.', 'Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Los Angeles, California, 90033, USA. ramsingh@med.usc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170801,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)'],IM,"['*DNA Transposable Elements', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immune Evasion', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology']",,,2017/08/03 06:00,2019/02/28 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-07356-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-07356-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Aug 1;7(1):7029. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-07356-9.,,,,PMC5539300,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2018 Mar 6;8(1):4240.

Protein alterations were detected with Western blotting. Apoptosis was measured with annexin V/flow cytometry. Growth-inhibitory effects of tested drugs were evaluated in vitro with cell number estimation and colony formation assay and in vivo with mouse xenograft models. Protein degradation was determined by comparing protein half-lives and inhibiting proteasome. Gene knockdown were achieved with siRNA or shRNA.Results: AZD9291 potently induced apoptosis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, in which ERK phosphorylation was suppressed accompanied with Bim elevation and Mcl-1 reduction likely due to enhanced Mcl-1 degradation and increased Bim stability. Blocking Bim elevation by gene knockdown or enforcing Mcl-1 expression attenuated or abolished AZD9291-induced apoptosis. Moreover, AZD9291 lost its ability to modulate Bim and Mcl-1 levels in AZD9291-resistant cell lines. The combination of a MEK inhibitor with AZD9291 restores the sensitivity of AZD9291-resistant cells including those with C797S mutation to undergo apoptosis and growth regression in vitro and in vivoConclusions: Modulation of MEK/ERK-dependent Bim and Mcl-1 degradation critically mediates sensitivity and resistance of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to AZD9291 and hence is an effective strategy to overcome acquired resistance to AZD9291.

Co-administration of histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as vorinostat (VOR), is reported to improve the clinical activity of AZA, but this has not been prospectively studied in patients with AML.Experimental Design: We compared outcomes in 259 adults with AML (n = 217) and MDS (n = 42) randomized to receive either AZA monotherapy (75 mg/m(2) x 7 days every 28 days) or AZA combined with VOR 300 mg twice a day on days 3 to 9 orally. Next-generation sequencing was performed in 250 patients on 41 genes commonly mutated in AML. Serial immunophenotyping of progenitor cells was performed in 47 patients.Results: Co-administration of VOR did not increase the overall response rate (P = 0.84) or overall survival (OS; P = 0.32). Specifically, no benefit was identified in either de novo or relapsed AML. Mutations in the genes CDKN2A (P = 0.0001), IDH1 (P = 0.004), and TP53 (P = 0.003) were associated with reduced OS. Lymphoid multipotential progenitor populations were greatly expanded at diagnosis and although reduced in size in responding patients remained detectable throughout treatment.Conclusions: This study demonstrates no benefit of concurrent administration of VOR with AZA but identifies a mutational signature predictive of outcome after AZA-based therapy. The correlation between heterozygous loss of function CDKN2A mutations and decreased OS implicates induction of cell-cycle arrest as a mechanism by which AZA exerts its clinical activity.

Tregs also respond during immune reactions to infectious agents in order to limit immunopathological damage from potent effectors such as CD8(+) cytolytic T lymphocytes. We have used the Friend virus (FV) model of retroviral infection in mice to investigate how viral infections induce Tregs. During acute FV infection, there is significant activation and expansion of thymus-derived (natural) Tregs that suppress virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. Unlike conventional T cells, the responding Tregs are not virus specific, so the mechanisms that induce their expansion are of great interest. We now show that B cells provide essential signals for Treg expansion during FV infection. Treg responses are greatly diminished in B cell-deficient mice but can be restored by adoptive transfers of B cells at the time of infection. The feeble Treg responses in B cell-deficient mice are associated with enhanced virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and accelerated virus control during the first 2 weeks of infection. In vitro experiments demonstrated that B cells promote Treg activation and proliferation through a glucocorticoid-induced receptor superfamily member 18 (GITR) ligand-dependent mechanism. Thus, B cells play paradoxically opposing roles during FV infection. They provide proliferative signals to immunsosuppressive Tregs, which slows early virus control, and they also produce virus-specific antibodies, which are essential for long-term virus control.IMPORTANCE When infectious agents invade a host, numerous immunological mechanisms are deployed to limit their replication, neutralize their spread, and destroy the host cells harboring the infection. Since immune responses also have a strong capacity to damage host cells and tissues, their magnitude, potency, and duration are under regulatory control. Regulatory T cells are an important component of this control, and the mechanisms that induce them to respond and exert immunosuppressive regulation are of great interest. In the current report, we show that B cells, the cells responsible for making pathogen-specific antibodies, are also involved in promoting the expansion of regulatory T cells during a retroviral infection. In vitro studies demonstrated that they do so via stimulation of the Tregs through interactions between cell surface molecules: GITR interactions with its ligand (GITRL) on B cells and GITR on regulatory T cells. These findings point the way toward therapeutics to better treat infections and autoimmune diseases.","['Moore, Tyler C', 'Gonzaga, Lorena M', 'Mather, Jennifer M', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J']","['Moore TC', 'Gonzaga LM', 'Mather JM', 'Messer RJ', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA khasenkrug@nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20170801,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tnfrsf18 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*regulatory T cells', '*retroviruses', '*tumor necrosis factor receptors']",2017/08/03 06:00,2018/04/04 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.01122-17 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.01122-17 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2017 Aug 1;8(4). pii: mBio.01122-17. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01122-17.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8523-4911'],PMC5539430,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical trials performed so far worldwide and analyze parameters such as targeted antigen and indication, CAR molecular design, CAR T cell manufacturing, anti-tumor activities, and related toxicities. More than 200 CAR T cell clinical trials have been initiated so far, most of which aim to treat lymphoma or leukemia patients using CD19-specific CARs. An increasing number of studies address solid tumors as well. Notably, not all clinical trials conducted so far have shown promising results. Indeed, in a few patients CAR T cell therapy resulted in severe adverse events with fatal outcome. Of note, less than 10% of the ongoing CAR T cell clinical trials are performed in Europe. Taking lead from our analysis, we discuss the problems and general hurdles preventing efficient clinical development of CAR T cells as well as opportunities, with a special focus on the European stage.","['Hartmann, Jessica', 'Schussler-Lenz, Martina', 'Bondanza, Attilio', 'Buchholz, Christian J']","['Hartmann J', 'Schussler-Lenz M', 'Bondanza A', 'Buchholz CJ']","['Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany jessica.hartmann@pei.de christian.buchholz@pei.de.', 'Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Innovative immunotherapies, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany jessica.hartmann@pei.de christian.buchholz@pei.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,EMBO Mol Med,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATMPs', '*cancer', '*immunotherapy', '*regulatory issues', '*toxicities']",2017/08/03 06:00,2018/06/07 06:00,['2017/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['emmm.201607485 [pii]', '10.15252/emmm.201607485 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Mol Med. 2017 Sep;9(9):1183-1197. doi: 10.15252/emmm.201607485.,,['(c) 2017 The Authors.

However, given the strong preclinical evidence of anti-neoplastic activity and the epidemiological associations suggesting that vitamin D compounds may have a place in cancer therapy, attempts are continuing to devise new approaches to their therapeutic use. This laboratory has developed a strategy to enhance the effectiveness of the currently standard therapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) by the immediate addition of the vitamin D2 analog Doxercalciferol combined with the plant polyphenol-derived Carnosic acid to AML cells previously treated with Cytarabine (AraC). Enhancement of AML cell death was noted to be dependent on VDR and BRAF kinase. Here we document that the stress-related kinase JNK is an important additional component of cell death enhancement in this protocol. Either the Knock-down or the inhibition of JNK activity reduced the enhancement of AraC-induced cell death, and we show that JNK signaling to the apoptosis regulator BIM and Caspase executioners of cell death are downstream of VDR and BRAF. A clear understanding of the molecular basis for the increased efficacy of AraC in the therapy of AML is expected to bring this regimen to a clinical trial.","['Wang, Xuening', 'Beute, William K', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang X', 'Beute WK', 'Harrison JS', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA.

This study was aimed to investigate the potential roles of miR-203 in the development and progression of OA, as well as to illustrate the possible molecular mechanism. OA was simulated in human cartilage C28/I2 cells with treatments of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced cell injury was evaluated according to cell viability, apoptosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Expression of miR-203 after LPS treatment was assessed. Then, miR-203 was aberrantly expressed, followed by evaluation of LPS-induced cell injury. The target gene of miR-203 was virtually screened by bioinformatics method and verified by luciferase assay. Moreover, the potential associated signaling pathways were also investigated. Results showed that LPS induced decrease of cell viability and increases of cell apoptosis, release of inflammatory cytokines and expression of miR-203. LPS-induced alterations were aggravated by miR-203 overexpression but were alleviated by miR-203 inhibition. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) was hypothesized and subsequently verified to be a target of miR-203, and miR-203 inhibition affected C28/I2 cells through up-regulating MCL-1. In addition, LPS-induced down-regulations of key kinases as well as phosphorylated kinases were further down-regulated by miR-203 overexpression but were abrogated by miR-203 inhibition. In conclusion, this study suggests that miR-203 suppression may inhibit the progression of OA by targeting MCL-1 and activating the Wnt/beta-Catenin and JAK/STAT signal pathways.","['Zhao, Changfu', 'Wang, Yang', 'Jin, Hui', 'Yu, Tao']","['Zhao C', 'Wang Y', 'Jin H', 'Yu T']","['Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130041, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.

Studies have confirmed that aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling occurs in various forms of leukemia, and is crucial for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of maltotriose (M3) modified fourth generation poly(propylene imine) dendrimers (PPI-G4) on Wnt/beta-catenin pathway gene expression in CLL (MEC-1) cells and to compare these findings with those obtained with fludarabine (FA). Microarray data analysis reveals seven of 19 Wnt/beta-catenin pathway genes whose expression changes significantly during dendrimer and FA treatment: WNT10A, WNT6, and CDH1 among others. PPI-G4-M3 is already known to influence MEC-1 cell apoptosis and proliferation. The obtained results suggest that the reduction in cell survival under the influence of glycodendrimers and FA may be due to loss of Wnt signaling.","['Franiak-Pietryga, Ida', 'Maciejewski, Henryk', 'Ziemba, Barbara', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Voit, Brigitte', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Jander, Magdalena', 'Trelinski, Jacek', 'Bryszewska, Maria', 'Borowiec, Maciej']","['Franiak-Pietryga I', 'Maciejewski H', 'Ziemba B', 'Appelhans D', 'Voit B', 'Robak T', 'Jander M', 'Trelinski J', 'Bryszewska M', 'Borowiec M']","['Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska Str. 251, 92-213, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical and Transplant Immunology and Genetics, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Pabianicka Str. 62, 93-513, Lodz, Poland.', 'GeneaMed LTD, Kopcinskiego Str. 16/18/904, 90-232, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Wroclaw University of Technology, Janiszewskiego Str. 11/17, 50-372, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska Str. 251, 92-213, Lodz, Poland.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Hohe Str. 6, D-01069, Dresden, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Hohe Str. 6, D-01069, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Pabianicka Str. 62, 93-513, Lodz, Poland.', 'GeneaMed LTD, Kopcinskiego Str. 16/18/904, 90-232, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Pabianicka Str. 62, 93-513, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska Str. 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska Str. 251, 92-213, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170801,Germany,Macromol Biosci,Macromolecular bioscience,101135941,"['0 (Dendrimers)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dendrimers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Wnt signaling pathway', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', '*fludarabine', '*microarray', '*poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimer']",2017/08/02 06:00,2018/07/22 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mabi.201700130 [doi]'],ppublish,Macromol Biosci. 2017 Nov;17(11). doi: 10.1002/mabi.201700130.

MicroRNA-144 (miR-144) participates in the regulation of the growth of many cancer cells. This study investigated the interaction between lncRNA UCA1 and miR-144 in lung cancer cells. The potential downstream protein of miR-144 was also assessed. Our results found that lncRNA UCA1 was highly expressed in human lung cancer A549, H517, H4006, H1299, and H1650 cells compared to normal embryonic lung WI-38 and HEL-1 cells. Knockdown of lncRNA UCA1 significantly inhibited lung cancer A549 cell viability, migration, invasion, and cell cycle progression, but promoted cell apoptosis. Besides, we found that lncRNA UCA1 was bound to miR-144. miR-144 participated in the regulation effects of lncRNA UCA1 on A549 cell viability, migration, invasion, cell cycle transition, and cell apoptosis. In addition, Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) was found to be a direct target gene of miR-144. Overexpression of PBX3 promoted A549 cell proliferation and metastasis.

OBJECTIVE: In this report, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of CAR-T on refractory and/or relapsed B-cell malignancies, including leukemia and lymphoma. METHODS: Clinical studies investigating efficacy and safety of CAR-T in acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE. Outcomes of efficacy subjected to analysis were the rates of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR). The safety parameters were the prevalence of adverse effects including fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. Meta analyses were performed using R software. Weighted hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for each outcome. Fixed or random-effects models were employed depending on the heterogeneity across the included studies. RESULTS: Nineteen published clinical studies with a total of 391 patients were included for the meta-analysis. The pooled rate of complete remission was 55% (95% CI 41%-69%); the pooled rate of partial remission was 25% (95% CI: 19%-33%). The prevalence of fever was 62% (95% CI: 41%-79%), the hypotension was 22% (95% CI: 15%-31%), and the acute renal failure was 24% (95% CI: 16%-34%). All adverse effects were manageable and no death was reported due to toxicity. CONCLUSION: CD19-targeted CAR-T is an effective modality in treating refractory B-cell malignancies including leukemia and lymphoma. However, there is still a need to develop strategies to improve the safety in its clinical use.","['Hao, Lu', 'Li, Tongtong', 'Chang, Lung-Ji', 'Chen, Xiaochuan']","['Hao L', 'Li T', 'Chang LJ', 'Chen X']","['Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, Shenzhen 518057, China.', 'Institute of Cancer Stem Cells, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China.', 'Clinical Medicine Program, Nanchang University Medical College, Nanchang 330006, China.', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Anfu People's Hospital, Jiangxi Province 343200, China."", 'Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, Shenzhen 518057, China.', 'Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, United States.', 'Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, Shenzhen 518057, China.', 'Department of Oriental Medicine, New York College of Health Professions, New York, NY 10016, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'Chimeric antigen receptor', 'adoptive T cell therapy', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'safety.']",2017/08/02 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-85096 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867324666170801101842 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2019;26(17):3068-3079. doi: 10.2174/0929867324666170801101842.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of patients harbor somatic mutations of CSF3R gene and are potentially amenable to targeted therapy with JAK inhibitors. The incidence and clinical significance of additional mutations requires clarification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A next-generation sequencing approach for myeloid malignancy-associated mutations was applied to diagnostic and matched blast crisis samples from four chronic neutrophilic leukemia patients. RESULTS: Next-generation sequencing confirmed the CSF3R T618I in all patients with identification of concurrent SRSF2, SETBP1, NRAS and CBL mutations at diagnosis. At blast crisis, clonal evolution was evidenced by an increased CSF3R T618I allele frequency and by loss or acquisition of CBL and NRAS mutations. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic utility of a targeted next-generation sequencing approach was clearly demonstrated with the identification of additional mutations providing the potential for therapeutic stratification of chronic neutrophilic leukemia patients.","['Langabeer, S E', 'Haslam, K', 'Kelly, J', 'Quinn, J', 'Morrell, R', 'Conneally, E']","['Langabeer SE', 'Haslam K', 'Kelly J', 'Quinn J', 'Morrell R', 'Conneally E']","[""Central Pathology Laboratory, Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland. slangabeer@stjames.ie."", ""Central Pathology Laboratory, Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Clinical Genetics, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."", 'Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Letterkenny University Hospital, Letterkenny, Ireland.', ""Department of Haematology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170731,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation']",['NOTNLM'],"['CSF3R', 'Chronic neutrophilic leukemia', 'Next-generation sequencing']",2017/08/02 06:00,2018/08/29 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2017/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-017-1722-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-017-1722-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2018 Mar;20(3):420-423. doi: 10.1007/s12094-017-1722-2.

The adjusted HR of ibrutinib versus the previous standard-of-care cohort was 0.15 (p < 0.0001) for progression-free survival (PFS) and 0.36 (p < 0.0001) for overall survival (OS). A similar difference was observed also when patients treated late in the period (2012-) were compared separately. Multivariate analysis showed that later line of therapy, male gender, older age and poor performance status were significant independent risk factors for worse PFS and OS. Our results suggest that PFS and OS with ibrutinib in the RESONATE study were significantly longer than with previous standard-of-care regimens used in second or later lines in routine healthcare. The approach used, which must be interpreted with caution, compares patient-level data from a clinical trial with outcomes observed in a daily clinical practice and may complement results from randomised trials or provide preliminary wider comparative information until phase 3 data exist.","['Hansson, Lotta', 'Asklid, Anna', 'Diels, Joris', 'Eketorp-Sylvan, Sandra', 'Repits, Johanna', 'Soltoft, Frans', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Osterborg, Anders']","['Hansson L', 'Asklid A', 'Diels J', 'Eketorp-Sylvan S', 'Repits J', 'Soltoft F', 'Jager U', 'Osterborg A']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. lotta.hansson@karolinska.se.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. lotta.hansson@karolinska.se.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Janssen EMEA, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Janssen Nordic, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Janssen Nordic, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20170731,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'Ibrutinib', 'Previous standard of care', 'Relapsed refractory']",2017/08/02 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3061-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3061-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Oct;96(10):1681-1691. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3061-3.

In the present study, we analyzed the prognostic significance of each KIT mutation (D816, N822K, and other mutations) in Japanese patients with CBF-AML. We retrospectively analyzed 136 cases of CBF-AML that had gone into complete remission (CR). KIT mutations were found in 61 (45%) of the patients with CBF-AML. D816, N822K, D816 and N822K, and other mutations of the KIT gene were detected in 29 cases (21%), 20 cases (15%), 7 cases (5%), and 5 cases (4%), respectively. The rate of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with D816 and with both D816 and N822K mutations was significantly lower than in patients with other or with no KIT mutations (RFS: p < 0.001, OS: p < 0.001). Moreover, stratified analysis of the chromosomal abnormalities t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13.1q22), t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) showed that D816 mutation was associated with a significantly worse prognosis. In a further multivariate analysis of RFS and OS, D816 mutation was found to be an independent risk factor for significantly poorer prognosis. In the present study, we were able to establish that, of all KIT mutations, D816 mutation alone is an unfavorable prognostic factor.","['Yui, Shunsuke', 'Kurosawa, Saiko', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Ueki, Toshimitsu', 'Uoshima, Nobuhiko', 'Mizuno, Ishikazu', 'Shono, Katsuhiro', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Nakamura, Yukinori', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Tajika, Kenji', 'Gomi, Seiji', 'Fukunaga, Keiko', 'Wakita, Satoshi', 'Ryotokuji, Takeshi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Inokuchi, Koiti']","['Yui S', 'Kurosawa S', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Kanamori H', 'Ueki T', 'Uoshima N', 'Mizuno I', 'Shono K', 'Usuki K', 'Chiba S', 'Nakamura Y', 'Yanada M', 'Kanda J', 'Tajika K', 'Gomi S', 'Fukunaga K', 'Wakita S', 'Ryotokuji T', 'Fukuda T', 'Inokuchi K']","['Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan. y-hiroki@fd6.so-net.ne.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagano Red Cross Hospital, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross, Kyoto dai-ni Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hyogo Cancer Center, Akashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba, Kasama, Japan.', 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170731,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia', 'D816 mutation', 'KIT', 'Prognostic factor']",2017/08/02 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3074-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3074-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Oct;96(10):1641-1652. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3074-y.

In particular, understanding of immune-mediated control of cancer has created opportunities to develop new forms of therapies based on engineered T cells. Unlike conventional drugs or biologics, the source material for these new therapies is collected from the patient or donor. The next step is commonly either enrichment to deplete unwanted cells, or methods to positively select T cells prior to polyclonal expansion or antigen-specific expansion.

However, the use of expensive targeted therapies can impact on the cost effectiveness of these tests. This study presents an economic evaluation of genomic testing in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the context of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses (using life-years and quality-adjusted life-years) were undertaken from a National Health Service and societal perspective. Five strategies were evaluated across several age groups using Markov modelling: three strategies that reflected varying current genetic testing practice and two configurations of genomic testing (including ibrutinib treatment). RESULTS: Genomic testing strategies yielded the most life-years/quality-adjusted life-years per patient, but were not cost effective compared with a threshold of pound30,000 per life-year/quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that there was some uncertainty surrounding this result. A genomic testing strategy becomes the most cost-effective option if a higher end-of-life cost-effectiveness threshold of pound50,000 is applied, if a societal costing perspective is considered in 25-year-old patients or if the cost of ibrutinib treatment falls. CONCLUSION: Stratifying patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to targeted treatment using genomic testing improves health outcomes, but will likely only represent a cost-effective use of limited National Health Service resources if a higher cost-effectiveness threshold or societal costing perspective is applied, or if the price of ibrutinib treatment is reduced. This result may be broadly indicative of the likely cost effectiveness of other genomic tests that inform the stratification of patients to high cost-targeted therapies.","['Buchanan, James', 'Wordsworth, Sarah', 'Clifford, Ruth', 'Robbe, Pauline', 'Taylor, Jenny C', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Knight, Samantha J L']","['Buchanan J', 'Wordsworth S', 'Clifford R', 'Robbe P', 'Taylor JC', 'Schuh A', 'Knight SJL']","['Health Economics Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK. james.buchanan@dph.ox.ac.uk.', 'Health Economics Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Oxford Cancer and Haematology Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Oxford Cancer and Haematology Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/economics/genetics', 'Markov Chains', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Uncertainty', 'United Kingdom']",,,2017/08/02 06:00,2018/07/14 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40273-017-0519-z [doi]', '10.1007/s40273-017-0519-z [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2017 Aug;35(8):845-858. doi: 10.1007/s40273-017-0519-z.,"['HICF-1009-026/Health Innovation Challenge Fund', '090532/Z/09/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'DRF-2011-04-021/National Institute for Health Research', 'DRF-2011-04-021/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'WT091989/Z/10/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2528-0638'],PMC5548825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it was reported that the methylene chloride fraction of E. kansui radix (EKC) regulated the differentiation of Th17 cells and alleviated the symptoms of Th17-related inflammatory bowel disease. Imiquimod (IMQ), a TLR7/8 agonist, has been used to induce psoriasis in a mouse model. In this study, we evaluated the effect of EKC in an IMQ-induced psoriasis model. EKC effectively inhibited the production of interleukin-17A and interferon-gamma in vitro. On this basis, EKC was administered to an animal model of psoriasis. Acanthosis and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the dermis were significantly reduced by EKC. EKC also inhibited the expression of IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23, IL-12, and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORgammat) in the spleen, skin-draining lymph nodes, and the skin. Additionally, EKC inhibited the activity of dendritic cells but not that of keratinocytes. In conclusion, EKC ameliorated the symptoms of psoriasis through inhibition of Th17 differentiation and activation of dendritic cells. These effects are expected to be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of psoriasis.","['Kim, Soo Jeong', 'Jang, Ye Won', 'Hyung, Kyung Eun', 'Lee, Da Kyoung', 'Hyun, Kee Hyeob', 'Park, So-Young', 'Park, Eon-Sub', 'Hwang, Kwang Woo']","['Kim SJ', 'Jang YW', 'Hyung KE', 'Lee DK', 'Hyun KH', 'Park SY', 'Park ES', 'Hwang KW']","['College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Dankook University, 119 Dandae-ro, Dongnam-gu, Cheonan-si, Chungnam 31116, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170702,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects', 'Euphorbia/*chemistry', 'Imiquimod', 'Interferon-gamma/drug effects', 'Interleukin-17/metabolism', 'Japan', 'Keratinocytes/drug effects', 'Medicine, East Asian Traditional', 'Methanol/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Psoriasis/chemically induced/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2017/08/02 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/7052560 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol Res. 2017;2017:7052560. doi: 10.1155/2017/7052560.

Although a few studies have attempted to elucidate the anticancer activities of C. militaris, the precise mechanism of C. militaris therapeutic effects is not fully understood. We examined the anticancer activities of C. militaris ethanolic extract (Cm-EE) and its cellular and molecular mechanisms. For this purpose, a xenograft mouse model bearing murine T cell lymphoma (RMA) cell-derived cancers was established to investigate in vivo anticancer mechanisms. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay, immunoblotting analysis, and flow cytometric assay were employed to check in vitro cytotoxicity, molecular targets, and proapoptotic action of Cm-EE. Interestingly, cancer sizes and mass were reduced in a C. militaris-administered group. Levels of the phosphorylated forms of p85 and AKT were clearly decreased in the group administered with Cm-EE. This result indicated that levels of phosphoglycogen synthase kinase 3beta (p-GSK3beta) and cleaved caspase-3 were increased with orally administered Cm-EE. In addition, Cm-EE directly inhibited the viability of cultured RMA cells and C6 glioma cells. The number of proapoptotic cells was significantly increased in a Cm-EE treated group compared with a control group.

A total of 121 newly diagnosed and untreated CML patients in chronic phase with complete clinical information from the First Hospital of Jilin University, from January 2010 to December 2014 were retrospectively recruited. Based on the platelet (PLT) count, 22 patients were assigned into CML with thrombocytosis (CML-T) group (PLT >1,000x10(9)/L) and 65 patients were classified into CML without extreme thrombocytosis (CML-N) group (PLT </=1,000x10(9)/L). Fifty-four point five percent of patients in the CML-T group were female, which was higher than that in the CML-N group (27.7%) (P=0.022). Except for gender, there was no significant difference for clinical information of patients between the two groups. For Sokal and Hasford scoring systems, the percentage of patients at high risk in the CML-T group were higher than those in the CML-N group, 95.5% vs 52.3% (P=0.000) and 68.2% vs 41.5% (P=0.031), respectively; however, there was no significant difference for European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) score system between the two groups (P=0.213). In terms of major molecular response (MMR) rate, the percent of patients with MMR in CML-T group was lower than that in CML-N group at 36 months after tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (P=0.037). Up until December 2016, the median of event-free survival was 21 months in the CML-T group, however, that was not reached in the CML-N group (P=0.027). The majority of CML patients with extreme thrombocytosis were females, and compared to patients in the CML-N group, the percentage of high risk patients based on the Sokal and Hasford scoring systems was higher in the CML-T group, and the median event-free survival of patients was shorter.","['Liu, Zhihe', 'Fan, Hongqiong', 'Li, Yuying', 'Liu, Chunshui']","['Liu Z', 'Fan H', 'Li Y', 'Liu C']","[""Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170717,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL1', 'EFS', 'MPNs', 'bone marrow', 'chronic phase']",2017/08/02 06:00,2017/08/02 06:01,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S142587 [doi]', 'ott-10-3515 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Jul 17;10:3515-3520. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S142587. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5522826,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the long-term follow-up and data on second primary malignancies (SPM) are presented. After a median follow-up of 96 months, progression-free survival (censored at allogeneic transplantation, PFS) remained significantly prolonged in the PAD versus VAD arm (hazard ratio (HR)=0.76, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.65-0.89, P=0.001). Overall survival (OS) was similar in the PAD versus VAD arm (HR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.74-1.08, P=0.24). The incidence of SPM were similar between the two arms (7% each, P=0.73). The negative prognostic effects of the cytogenetic aberration deletion 17p13 (clone size 10%) and renal impairment at baseline (serum creatinine >2 mg dl(-1)) on PFS and OS remained abrogated in the PAD but not VAD arm.

Recent publications indicate that patients with acute leukaemia are prone to symptoms, an indication for which a close collaboration between the patient's haematologist and a palliative care team might result in improved symptom management. The object of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical research trial to assess the effect of early palliative care in patients with acute leukaemia after one relapse. METHODS: This project is a multicentre, non-blinded, randomised, controlled trial. Patients in group 1 will receive standard haematological care associated with palliative care (intervention group). Patients in group 2 will receive standard haematological care with palliative care only if requested by the haematologist (control group). In order to measure an accurate sample size, patients who participate will complete a standardised questionnaire to assess their quality of life, as well as their psychological and physical symptoms, before being randomised to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio without stratified randomisation. RESULTS: The aim of this study is to analyse causes of dropout, non-adherence and missing data in order to refine the protocol for the subsequent clinical research trial. CONCLUSION: The ultimate objective of this project is to develop collaboration between haematologists and palliative care teams in order to improve patients' quality of life.","['Barbaret, Cecile', 'Berthiller, Julien', 'Schott Pethelaz, Anne-Marie', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Sanchez, Stephane', 'Filbet, Marilene']","['Barbaret C', 'Berthiller J', 'Schott Pethelaz AM', 'Michallet M', 'Salles G', 'Sanchez S', 'Filbet M']","['Palliative Care, Clinique de Soins Palliatifs et Coordination de Soins de Support, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Grenoble, Grenoble, Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, France.', 'Medical department, Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.', 'Clinical Research, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, HESPER unit EA 7425, Lyon, France.', 'Clinical Research, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pole IMER, Lyon, France.', 'Clinical Research, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, HESPER unit EA 7425, Lyon, France.', 'Clinical Research, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pole IMER, Lyon, France.', ""Hematology, Service d'Hematologie du centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France."", ""Hematology, Service d'Hematologie du centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France."", 'Medical department, Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.', 'Palliative Care, Centre de Soins Palliatifs, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Clinical Research, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, HESPER unit EA 7425, Lyon, France.', 'Palliative Care, Centre de Soins Palliatifs, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20170731,England,BMJ Support Palliat Care,BMJ supportive & palliative care,101565123,,IM,"['Feasibility Studies', 'Hematology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Patient Compliance', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Research Design']",['NOTNLM'],"['collaboration', 'haematology', 'palliative care', 'quality of life', 'symptom management']",2017/08/02 06:00,2018/09/19 06:00,['2017/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmjspcare-2016-001173 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjspcare-2016-001173 [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2017 Dec;7(4):480-484. doi: 10.1136/bmjspcare-2016-001173.

A series of previous studies emphasized the importance of three C-terminal tyrosines in Syk for kinase activity regulation, as docking sites for downstream effector molecules, and for Ca(2+) mobilization. Here, we investigated the roles of these C-terminal tyrosines in the mouse. Surprisingly, expression of a triple tyrosine-to-phenylalanine human Syk mutant, SYK(Y3F), was not associated with discernible signaling defects either in reconstituted DT40 cells or in B or mast cells from mice expressing SYK(Y3F) instead of wild-type Syk. Remarkably, lymphocyte differentiation, calcium mobilization, and 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP)-specific immune responses were unperturbed in SYK(Y3F) mice. These results emphasize the capacity of immune cells to compensate for specific molecular defects, likely using redundant intermolecular interactions, and highlight the importance of in vivo analyses for understanding cellular signaling mechanisms.","['Weis, Vanessa', 'Konigsberger, Sebastian', 'Amler, Susanne', 'Wienands, Jurgen', 'Kiefer, Friedemann']","['Weis V', 'Konigsberger S', 'Amler S', 'Wienands J', 'Kiefer F']","['Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Mammalian Cell Signaling Laboratory, Munster, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Mammalian Cell Signaling Laboratory, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, Westfalischen Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Georg-August-Universitat, Abt.

Oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) was reported to be differentially methylated and associated with prognosis in AML and, as reported for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant glioma, may play a role in malignant transformation. We report that DNA methylation of OLIG2 is associated with decreased expression of mRNA in AML cell lines and patients. Moreover, in cell lines, decreased mRNA expression also translated into decreased OLIG2 protein expression. Treatment of non-expressing cell lines PL-21 and U-937 with the demethylating agent decitabine resulted in robust re-expression of OLIG2 on mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, stable overexpression of OLIG2 in non-expressing cell lines Kasumi-1 and U-937, using a lentiviral vector system, led to moderate growth inhibition after 4 days and resulted in signs of differentiation in U-937 cells. Interestingly, although CD34 + cells from healthy donors and 10 of 12 AML patients exhibited no protein expression, OLIG2 was expressed in two patients, both bearing the translocation t(15;17), corresponding to OLIG2 expression in NB-4 cells, also harboring t(15;17). In conclusion, we provide first evidence that OLIG2 is epigenetically regulated via DNA methylation and expressed in a subset of AML patients. OLIG2 may exert antiproliferative activity in leukemia cell lines, and its potential leukemia-suppressing role in AML warrants further investigation.","['Yalcin, Arzu', 'Kovarbasic, Marlon', 'Wehrle, Julius', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Abdelkarim, Mahmoud', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Schmidts, Andrea', 'Wasch, Ralph', 'Pahl, Heike L', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Hackanson, Bjorn']","['Yalcin A', 'Kovarbasic M', 'Wehrle J', 'Claus R', 'Becker H', 'Abdelkarim M', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Schmidts A', 'Wasch R', 'Pahl HL', 'Dohner K', 'Bullinger L', 'Duyster J', 'Lubbert M', 'Hackanson B']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany; Berta-Ottenstein-Programm, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany; Department of Hematology/Oncology, Medical Center Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.

Recent reports suggest that NCTD targeting ROS/AMPK and DNA replication signaling pathway could be an effective strategy for the treatment of PCa cells. However, supportive evidence is limited to the effect of NCTD that induction of apoptosis through suppression of the Mcl-1. Here, we show that NCTD induced PCa cell apoptosis and triggered caspase activation, which was associated with mitochondria dysfunction. Mechanistic investigations suggested that NCTD modulated the Akt signaling via increased nuclear translocation and interaction with the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) promoter by FOXO4, resulting in an apoptotic effect. Moreover, miR-320d, which targets Mcl-1, was significantly upregulated after NCTD treatment. Overexpression of miR-320d by NCTD induced mitochondria dysfunction and apoptosis, which was notably attenuated with a miR-320d inhibitor. In vivo xenograft analysis revealed that NCTD significantly reduced tumor growth in mice with PC3 tumor xenografts. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the critical role of NCTD in suppressing Mcl-1 via epigenetic upregulation of miR-320d, resulting in PCa cell apoptosis.","['Lin, Chu-Liang', 'Chen, Chien-Min', 'Lin, Chia-Liang', 'Cheng, Chun-Wen', 'Lee, Chien-Hsing', 'Hsieh, Yi-Hsien']","['Lin CL', 'Chen CM', 'Lin CL', 'Cheng CW', 'Lee CH', 'Hsieh YH']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""School of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital of China Medical University, Taichung.

Our continuous interest to reveal the secrecies of the mysterious Pim-1 kinase binding pocket has led us to employ a structure based drug design procedure based on receptor-ligand pharmacophore generation protocol implemented in Discovery Studio 4.5 (DS 4.5). Subsequently, we collected 104 crystal structures of Pim-1 kinase from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and used them to generate pharmacophores based on the anticipated co-crystallized ligand-Pim 1 kinase receptor interactions. All selected pharmacophoric features were enumerated and only those that had corresponding valuable receptor-ligand interactions were retained. This was followed by modeling all pharmacophore combinations and scoring them according to their Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis parameters as well as a DS.4.5 built-in Genetic Function Algorithm (GFA) validating model. Accordingly, 111 pharmacophores resulted with acceptable ROC performances; 1XWS_2_04, 2BIK_2_06, and 1XWS_2_06 (ROC AUC value of: 0.770, 0.743 and 0.741 respectively) were the best pharmacophores.

The aim of this retrospective study was to describe nutritional status of newly diagnosed adult patients with AML at admission and during induction chemotherapy. METHODS: We included consecutive newly diagnosed adult patients with AML who were admitted to the Department of Hematology (Limoges University Hospital) from April 2010 to January 2014. Nutritional assessment included body mass index (BMI) and weight loss to diagnose undernutrition. Weekly laboratory tests were collected and total energy expenditure was calculated to adapt food intake. RESULTS: Of 95 patients, 14 (15%) presented with undernutrition at admission: low BMI values (P < 0.001) and weight loss >5% for 9.5% patients. After chemotherapy induction, 17 patients (18%) were undernutrition (P = 0.05). Patients without undernutrition had a significantly lower median weight, BMI, and serum albumin level at discharge compared with their admission values (P < 0.05); whereas their serum transthyretin levels were higher (P = 0.03).

In conjunction with the use of high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, these newer antimyeloma agents facilitated the augmentation of deeper responses and as a result, enhanced survival outcomes. Despite mounting clinical evidence that novel therapies may mitigate the poor prognostic impact of some predictors historically considered ""harbingers of doom"" in myeloma such as t(4;14), the benefit of these advances is less evident in patients who present with genetically defined high-risk features such as presence of chromosomal abnormalities del17p, t(14;16), or t(14;20), or among patients presenting with plasma cell leukemia. With better understanding of the biology of the disease and further recognition of the genomic instability of the high-risk clonal plasma cell influencing both inherent and acquired therapeutic resistance, newer targeted treatment strategies will hopefully improve prognosis in future among this subset of patients with poorer outcomes. In this review, we not only focus on how to identify the genetically defined high-risk patients with myeloma but also describe the most optimal antimyeloma combination strategies that so far have shown to demonstrate long-term benefits for these patients.","['Joseph, Nisha S', 'Gentili, Silvia', 'Kaufman, Jonathan L', 'Lonial, Sagar', 'Nooka, Ajay K']","['Joseph NS', 'Gentili S', 'Kaufman JL', 'Lonial S', 'Nooka AK']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.', 'Clinica di Ematologia Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 73 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome who had been treated at the inpatient and outpatient malignant hematology at Moffitt Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center, were included. Two paired measurements of self-reported quality of life were used, 1 before treatment and 1 at 1 month after treatment to compare intensive versus nonintensive treatment. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia version for the quality-of-life measurement. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of treatment and time and the interaction of treatment and time. The main research variables were intensive versus nonintensive treatment as the independent variable and quality of life measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia version as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Physical function and leukemia symptoms improved for patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. A trend was found for improved quality of life for the intensive treatment compared with nonintensive treatment, for which the quality of life was stable at 1 month. CONCLUSION: The study participants treated with inpatient, induction chemotherapy experienced statistically significant improvement in their quality of life at 1 month.

The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of ibrutinib therapy in various B-cell malignancies in the general community. The secondary objectives included studying the adverse effects, ibrutinib-induced peripheral lymphocytosis, and effect on immunoglobulin levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study was a retrospective observational cohort analysis conducted at Abington Jefferson Health. The clinical response was determined from the hematologist's assessment and evaluated independently using the response criteria for each B-cell malignancy. Adverse effects were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare immunoglobulin levels before and after ibrutinib. Forty five patients with B-cell malignancies and receiving ibrutinib therapy were eligible. RESULTS: The median age was 73 years (range, 49-96 years), and 84.4% of the patients had received >/= 1 previous therapy. The best overall response rate of all cohorts combined was 63.8%. The greatest overall response rate was observed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (76.1%), followed by those with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (75%). Of the 45 patients, 88.9% experienced adverse effects. Antiplatelet activity of ibrutinib was most commonly observed (30.5%). Of note, 5 patients (11%) developed new-onset atrial fibrillation after drug initiation. Peripheral lymphocytosis after drug initiation was observed in most patients, with a peak level at 1 month (median lymphocyte count, 2.7 x 10(3) cells/muL). Although the IgG levels at 3, 6, and 12 months had decreased (P = .01 for all) compared with the levels before ibrutinib, the IgA levels had not increased at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (P = .6, P = .5, P = .3, and P = .9, respectively). CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib is a highly effective and tolerable drug for B-cell malignancies in the general community. In contrast to the previously reported rate of 5% to 7%, we observed a higher rate (11%) of atrial fibrillation, which might have resulted from the smaller sample size in the present study and the multiple comorbidities. Nonetheless, this treatment-limiting side effect requires further elucidation. Paradoxical lymphocytosis at the outset of therapy was a common and benign finding. In conjunction with the reported trials, the IgG levels decreased in the first year of continued therapy. However, the IgA levels did not increase, even after 2 years of therapy.","['Ali, Naveed', 'Malik, Faizan', 'Jafri, Syed Imran Mustafa', 'Naglak, Mary', 'Sundermeyer, Mark', 'Pickens, Peter V']","['Ali N', 'Malik F', 'Jafri SIM', 'Naglak M', 'Sundermeyer M', 'Pickens PV']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Abington Jefferson Health, Abington, PA.

The survival benefit conferred by this agent, along with its marked efficacy with regard to spleen volume and symptom reduction, have made ruxolitinib the cornerstone of drug therapy in MF. However, there remain significant unmet needs in the treatment of patients with MF, and many novel classes of agents continue to be investigated in efforts to build on the progress made with ruxolitinib. These include inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase isoforms, heat shock protein 90, cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6, and Hedgehog signaling, among others. In parallel, other JAK inhibitors with potential for less myelosuppression or even improvement of anemia, greater selectivity for JAK1 or JAK2, and the ability to overcome JAK inhibitor persistence are in various stages of development. First-in-class agents such as the activin receptor IIA ligand trap sotatercept (for anemia of MF), the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat, and the antifibrotic agent PRM-151 (recombinant human pentraxin-2) are also in clinical trials. In polycythemia vera, a novel interferon administered every 2 weeks is being developed for front-line therapy in high-risk individuals, and inhibitors of human double minute 2 (HDM2) have shown promise in preclinical studies, as have HDAC inhibitors such as givinostat (both in the laboratory and in the clinic).

Using case-specific sensitive molecular probes or multiparametric flow cytometry on marrow samples obtained from the end of induction until midconsolidation, MRD assays can detect up to 1 leukemic cell of 10,000 total mononuclear cells (sensitivity, 0.01%; ie, >/=10(4)). This cutoff, presently bound to technical limitations and subject to improvement, reflects the individual chemosensitivity and is strongly correlated with treatment outcome. The chance for cure is approximately 70% in the MRD-negative subset but only 20% to 30% in MRD-positive patients, in any diagnostic and risk subset. As shown by prospective trials from Germany, Italy, Spain, and France-Switzerland-Belgium, approximately 50% to 70% of unselected adult patients with Philadelphia-negative ALL achieve and maintain an early MRD response, whereas the remainder do not, including a substantial proportion of clinically standard-risk patients, and require an HCT to avert at least partially the risk of relapse. Along with the diffusion of more effective ""pediatric-inspired"" chemotherapy programs, the MRD analysis is an integral part of a modern management strategy, guiding the decision process to transplant or not, in which case nonrelapse mortality using HCT in first remission-still 10% to 20%-is totally abolished. The use of new agents such as monoclonal antibodies, small inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells is opening a new era of MRD-directed therapies, that will further increase survival rates.","['Bassan, Renato', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Scattolin, Annamaria', 'Viero, Piera', 'Maino, Elena', 'Sancetta, Rosaria', 'Carobolante, Francesca', 'Gianni, Francesca', 'Stefanoni, Paola', 'Tosi, Manuela', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Bassan R', 'Intermesoli T', 'Scattolin A', 'Viero P', 'Maino E', 'Sancetta R', 'Carobolante F', 'Gianni F', 'Stefanoni P', 'Tosi M', 'Spinelli O', 'Rambaldi A']","[""Hematology Unit, Ospedale dell'Angelo and Ospedale Ss Giovanni e Paolo, Mestre Venezia, Italy.

Hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy is one of the mainstays of MDS therapy. Failure of HMA therapy is related to poor outcome; hence, new therapeutic approaches are warranted in these patients. In MDS, the immune system has a pivotal role in modulation of hematopoiesis and clonal expansion. In neoplastic conditions, immune checkpoint (PD-1 and CTLA4 molecules) hide tumor cells from immune surveillance. Identification of the pattern of expression of these molecules in MDS provides an interesting alternative within clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the clinicopathologic correlations by morphology, immunohistochemistry (PD-L1) and flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis in an MDS patient treated with immune checkpoint PD-1 inhibitor. RESULTS: Bone marrow (BM) morphology, differential counts and aberrant flow markers were assessed before and after anti PD-1 inhibitor therapy. At baseline, BM showed severe trilineage dysplasia with decreased granulopoiesis; after therapy, BM showed normal trilineage hematopoiesis. A decrease in PD-L1 expression, by manual and automatic analysis, was also noted from 15% to 5% after 26 months of treatment. The findings correlated with the recovery of peripheral blood counts and transfusion independency. CONCLUSION: BM morphology and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry can be used to assess treatment response in immune checkpoints therapy.","['Hidalgo-Lopez, Juliana E', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Quesada, Andres E', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Hu, Zhihong', 'Mitsuhashi, Takayuki', 'Yabe, Mariko', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Hidalgo-Lopez JE', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Quesada AE', 'Thakral B', 'Hu Z', 'Mitsuhashi T', 'Yabe M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

In Lebanon, we rapidly adopted this treatment strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the survival rates of Lebanese CML patients. We examined the rates of major molecular response (MMR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and analyzed the overall survival, progression-free survival, and event-free survival of CML patients treated with front-line imatinib in 3 university hospitals in Lebanon. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 46 patients diagnosed with CML and treated with front-line imatinib 400 mg/day from 2000 and followed up to 2015. In all patients, initially, 2 diagnostic tests were performed: cytogenetic analysis and qualitative molecular testing of the BCR-ABL transcript. The male-to-female sex ratio was 3:1. The median age at diagnosis was 49 years, and the mean age was 44.52 years. At diagnosis, 46 patients were in the chronic phase. All patients started imatinib 400 mg/day. Of the 46 patients, 35 had a typical karyotype, 8 an atypical karyotype, and 3 hypoploidism. RESULTS: The MMR rate at 18 months was 58.69%. The cumulative CCyR rate at 18 months of therapy with imatinib at the standard dose was 67.39%. The event-free survival rate was 75.86% and 74.14% at 5 and 8 years, respectively. The progression-free survival rate was 77.59% and 75.86% at 5 and 8 years, respectively. The overall survival rate was 98.27% and 98.27% at 5 and 8 years, respectively. Of the 46 patients, 12 developed disease progression and were salvaged by second-generation TKIs. These 12 patients were still alive with a MMR. CONCLUSION: In our study population, the achievement of a MMR and CCyR and overall survival, progression-free survival, and event-free survival were similar to previous published data. Reaching high survival rates with a first-generation TKI in a country with limited resources is a reasonable treatment approach for CML patients.","['Massoud, Marcel', 'Sakr, Riwa', 'Kerbage, Fouad', 'Makdissi, Joseph', 'Hawi, Jenny', 'Rached, Layale', 'Nasr, Fady', 'Chahine, Georges']","['Massoud M', 'Sakr R', 'Kerbage F', 'Makdissi J', 'Hawi J', 'Rached L', 'Nasr F', 'Chahine G']","['Department of Medicine, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Medical School, Kaslik, Lebanon; Department of Medicine, University Hospital Center Notre Dame de Secours, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Department of Medicine, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Medical School, Kaslik, Lebanon; Department of Medicine, University Hospital Center Notre Dame de Secours, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Department of Medicine, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Medical School, Kaslik, Lebanon; Department of Medicine, University Hospital Center Notre Dame de Secours, Byblos, Lebanon.

Patients usually present with high fever, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and hepatosplenomegaly, and their disease process ranges from mild to fatal multiorgan failure. HLH is a heterogeneous group of disorders that can be triggered by infections, neoplasms, or autoimmune diseases. The HLH diagnosis can be difficult to confidently confirm in critically ill patients while waiting for pathology or reference laboratory results to return, delaying the diagnosis with significantly worsened outcomes. The current HLH-2004 diagnostic guidelines were originally developed for pediatric cases and were not validated to diagnose secondary HLH, whether in children or adults. In addition, some laboratory findings that are common among HLH patients such as hypoalbuminemia and elevated liver enzymes are not represented in the HLH-2004 guidelines. Even more challenging for clinicians is that many of the diagnostic features of this syndrome are nonspecific. For example, the clinical presentation of HLH can meet the diagnostic criteria of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, viral infections, or neoplastic diseases. It is necessary to revisit the diagnostic criteria for HLH by validating the clinical and laboratory findings in large prospective HLH prospective clinical trials or by establishing registries. This will improve our understanding of HLH, help validate and develop newer, more specific, and more rapidly obtainable diagnostic criteria, and, eventually, result in earlier therapy with more consistent monitoring of the response.","['Otrock, Zaher K', 'Daver, Naval', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Eby, Charles S']","['Otrock ZK', 'Daver N', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Eby CS']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.

We demonstrate that CLL derived CD4(+)CD25(-)CD127(-) and CD4(+)CD25(low)CD127(-) subpopulations share a common immunophenotypic profile with conventional Tregs and are associated with advanced stage disease. We further provide evidence that the increased number of Tregs contributes indirectly to the proliferation of the CLL clone, by suppressing the proliferation of Teffs which in turn suppress CLL cells. These data are further supported by our observations that CLL derived Tregs appear rather incapable of inducing apoptosis of both normal B cells and CLL cells, in contrast to normal Tregs, suggesting an immunoediting effect of CLL cells on Tregs which negatively affects the functionality of the latter and contributes to the failure of Tregs in CLL to efficiently eliminate the abnormal clone.","['Mpakou, Vassiliki E', 'Ioannidou, Heleni-Dikaia', 'Konsta, Eugene', 'Vikentiou, Myrofora', 'Spathis, Aris', 'Kontsioti, Frieda', 'Kontos, Christos K', 'Velentzas, Athanassios D', 'Papageorgiou, Sotiris', 'Vasilatou, Diamantina', 'Gkontopoulos, Konstantinos', 'Glezou, Irene', 'Stavroulaki, Georgia', 'Mpazani, Efthimia', 'Kokkori, Stella', 'Kyriakou, Elias', 'Karakitsos, Petros', 'Dimitriadis, George', 'Pappa, Vasiliki']","['Mpakou VE', 'Ioannidou HD', 'Konsta E', 'Vikentiou M', 'Spathis A', 'Kontsioti F', 'Kontos CK', 'Velentzas AD', 'Papageorgiou S', 'Vasilatou D', 'Gkontopoulos K', 'Glezou I', 'Stavroulaki G', 'Mpazani E', 'Kokkori S', 'Kyriakou E', 'Karakitsos P', 'Dimitriadis G', 'Pappa V']","['Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Department of Cytopathology, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, Section of Cell Biology and Biophysics, School of Science, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Attikon University General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Attikon University General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Cytopathology, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Dept. of Internal Medicine and Research Institute, Attikon University Hospital, 1 Rimini st., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.

Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) is a life-threatening complication of HCT that belongs to a group of diseases increasingly identified as transplant-related, systemic endothelial diseases. In most cases, SOS/VOD resolves within weeks; however, severe SOS/VOD results in multi-organ dysfunction/failure with a mortality rate >80%. A timely diagnosis of SOS/VOD is of critical importance, given the availability of therapeutic options with favorable tolerability. Current diagnostic criteria are used for adults and children. However, over the last decade it has become clear that SOS/VOD is significantly different between the age groups in terms of incidence, genetic predisposition, clinical presentation, prevention, treatment and outcome. Improved understanding of SOS/VOD and the availability of effective treatment questions the use of the Baltimore and Seattle criteria for diagnosing SOS/VOD in children. The aim of this position paper is to propose new diagnostic and severity criteria for SOS/VOD in children on behalf of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.","['Corbacioglu, S', 'Carreras, E', 'Ansari, M', 'Balduzzi, A', 'Cesaro, S', 'Dalle, J-H', 'Dignan, F', 'Gibson, B', 'Guengoer, T', 'Gruhn, B', 'Lankester, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Peters, C', 'Richardson, P G', 'Schulz, A S', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Stein, J', 'Sykora, K-W', 'Toporski, J', 'Trigoso, E', 'Vetteranta, K', 'Wachowiak, J', 'Wallhult, E', 'Wynn, R', 'Yaniv, I', 'Yesilipek, A', 'Mohty, M', 'Bader, P']","['Corbacioglu S', 'Carreras E', 'Ansari M', 'Balduzzi A', 'Cesaro S', 'Dalle JH', 'Dignan F', 'Gibson B', 'Guengoer T', 'Gruhn B', 'Lankester A', 'Locatelli F', 'Pagliuca A', 'Peters C', 'Richardson PG', 'Schulz AS', 'Sedlacek P', 'Stein J', 'Sykora KW', 'Toporski J', 'Trigoso E', 'Vetteranta K', 'Wachowiak J', 'Wallhult E', 'Wynn R', 'Yaniv I', 'Yesilipek A', 'Mohty M', 'Bader P']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, Josep Carreras Foundation & Leukemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hemato-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Clinic, University of Milano-Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncohematology, Giambattista Rossi University Hospital, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris 7-Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK.', 'Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK.', ""Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Pavia, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Haematology, King's College Hospital, London, UK."", 'Department of Pediatrics, St Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancy, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, University of Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv, Israel."", ""Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Medical School, Hannover, Germany."", 'Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'University Hospital and Polytechnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Section of Hematology and Coagulation, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK."", ""Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, University of Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv, Israel."", 'Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Bahcesehir University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Hopital Saint-Antoine, APHP, Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, INSERM UMRS 938, Paris, France.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170731,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Europe', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/08/02 06:00,2019/03/09 06:00,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2017161 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2017.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2018 Feb;53(2):138-145. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2017.161.

Although this approach leads to remissions in the majority of patients, long-term disease control remains unsatisfactory as mirrored by overall survival rates of approximately 30%. The reason for this poor outcome is, in part, due to various toxicities associated with traditional AML therapy and the limited ability of most patients to tolerate such treatment. More effective and less toxic therapies therefore represent an unmet need in the management of AML, a disease for which therapeutic progress has been traditionally slow when compared to other cancers. Several studies have shown that leukemic blasts elicit immune responses that could be exploited for the development of novel treatment concepts. To this end, early phase studies of immune-based therapies in AML have delivered encouraging results and demonstrated safety and feasibility. In this review, we discuss opportunities for immunotherapeutic interventions to enhance the potential to achieve a cure in AML, thereby focusing on the role of monoclonal antibodies, hypomethylating agents and the leukemic microenvironment.","['Gbolahan, Olumide Babajide', 'Zeidan, Amer M', 'Stahl, Maximilian', 'Abu Zaid, Mohammad', 'Farag, Sherif', 'Paczesny, Sophie', 'Konig, Heiko']","['Gbolahan OB', 'Zeidan AM', 'Stahl M', 'Abu Zaid M', 'Farag S', 'Paczesny S', 'Konig H']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. obgbolah@iu.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA. amer.zeidan@yale.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA. maximilian.stahl@yale.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. mabuzaid@iu.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. ssfarag@iu.edu.', 'Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. sophpacz@iu.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. hkonig@iupui.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170731,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'hypomethylating agents', 'immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies', 'microenvironment']",2017/08/02 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18081660 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18081660 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Jul 31;18(8). pii: ijms18081660. doi: 10.3390/ijms18081660.,['UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC5578050,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anticancer effect of tricetin in nonsolid tumors remains unclear. Herein, the molecular mechanisms by which tricetin exerts its anticancer effects on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were investigated. Results showed that tricetin inhibited cell viability in various types of AML cell lines. Tricetin induced morphological features of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, and significantly activated proapoptotic signaling including caspase-8, -9, and -3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in HL-60 AML cells. Of note, tricetin-induced cell growth inhibition was dramatically reversed by a pan caspase and caspase-8- and -9-specific inhibitors, suggesting that this compound mainly acts through a caspase-dependent pathway. Moreover, treatment of HL-60 cells with tricetin induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and inhibition of ERK and JNK by their specific inhibitors respectively promoted and abolished tricetin-induced cell apoptosis. Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) staining showed that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were higher in tricetin-treated HL-60 cells compared to the control group. Moreover, an ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), reversed tricetin-induced JNK activation and subsequent cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our results indicated that tricetin induced cell death of leukemic HL-60 cells through induction of intracellular oxidative stress following activation of a JNK-mediated apoptosis pathway. A combination of tricetin and an ERK inhibitor may be a better strategy to enhance the anticancer activities of tricetin in AML.","['Chien, Ming-Hsien', 'Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Lee, Wei-Jiunn', 'Chen, Hui-Yu', 'Tan, Peng', 'Wen, Yu-Ching', 'Lin, Yung-Wei', 'Hsiao, Pei-Ching', 'Yang, Shun-Fa']","['Chien MH', 'Chow JM', 'Lee WJ', 'Chen HY', 'Tan P', 'Wen YC', 'Lin YW', 'Hsiao PC', 'Yang SF']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan. mhchien1976@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan. mhchien1976@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan. chow0803@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan. lwj5905@gmail.com.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan. lwj5905@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 402, Taiwan. albee55@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan. cancercute@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan. s811007@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan. s811007@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan. highwei168@gmail.com.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan. highwei168@gmail.com.', 'School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 402, Taiwan. cshy046@csh.org.tw.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 402, Taiwan. cshy046@csh.org.tw.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 402, Taiwan. ysf@csmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 402, Taiwan. ysf@csmu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170731,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5627PY99ZO (tricetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase', 'reactive oxygen species', 'tricetin']",2017/08/02 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18081667 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18081667 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Jul 31;18(8). pii: ijms18081667. doi: 10.3390/ijms18081667.,,,,PMC5578057,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of AML patients with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors results in global hypomethylation of genes and, thereby, can lead to a reactivation of the differentiation capability. Unfortunately, after termination of treatment both hypermethylation and differentiation block return in most cases. Here, we apply, for the first time, a computational model of epigenetic regulation of transcription to: i) provide a mechanistic understanding of the DNA (de-) methylation process in AML and; ii) improve DNA demethylation treatment strategies. By in silico simulation, we analyze promoter hypermethylation scenarios referring to DNMT dysfunction, decreased H3K4me3 and increased H3K27me3 modification activity, and accelerated cell proliferation. We quantify differences between these scenarios with respect to gene repression and activation. Moreover, we compare the scenarios regarding their response to DNMT inhibitor treatment alone and in combination with inhibitors of H3K27me3 histone methyltransferases and of H3K4me3 histone demethylases. We find that the different hypermethylation scenarios respond specifically to therapy, suggesting that failure of remission originates in patient-specific deregulation. We observe that inappropriate demethylation therapy can result even in enforced deregulation. As an example, our results suggest that application of high DNMT inhibitor concentration can induce unwanted global gene activation if hypermethylation originates in increased H3K27me3 modification. Our results underline the importance of a personalized therapy requiring knowledge about the patient-specific mechanism of epigenetic deregulation.","['Przybilla, Jens', 'Hopp, Lydia', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Loeffler, Markus', 'Galle, Joerg']","['Przybilla J', 'Hopp L', 'Lubbert M', 'Loeffler M', 'Galle J']","['a Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics, University of Leipzig , Leipzig , Germany.', 'd Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig , Leipzig , Germany.', 'a Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics, University of Leipzig , Leipzig , Germany.', 'b Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'c German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) , Freiburg , Germany.', 'd Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig , Leipzig , Germany.', 'a Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics, University of Leipzig , Leipzig , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171006,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Demethylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Demethylases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"[""*5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine"", '*5-azacytidine', '*DNA methylation', '*DNMT inhibitors', '*Decitabine', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*computational modeling', '*demethylation therapy', '*histone modification', '*mathematical modeling']",2017/08/02 06:00,2018/10/27 06:00,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15592294.2017.1361090 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2017;12(10):886-896. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2017.1361090.

Previous studies analyzing relapse samples have shown a high degree of heterogeneity regarding gene alterations without an evident relapse signature. Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 31 adult B-cell precursor ALL patients at first relapse, and 21 paired diagnostic samples were analyzed by multiplex ligation probe-dependent amplification (MLPA). Nineteen paired diagnostic and relapse samples of these 21 patients were also analyzed by SNP arrays. A trend to acquire homozygous CDKN2A/B deletions and a significant increase in the number of copy number alterations (CNA) was observed from diagnosis to first relapse. Evolution from an ancestral clone was the main pattern of clonal evolution. Relapse samples were extremely heterogeneous regarding CNA frequencies. However, CDKN2A/B, PAX5, ETV6, ATM, IKZF1, VPREB1, and TP53 deletions and duplications of 1q, 8q, 17q, 21, X/Y PAR1, and Xp were frequently detected at relapse. Duplications of genes involved in cell proliferation, drug resistance and stem cell homeostasis regulation, as well as deletions of KDM6A and STAG2 genes emerged as specific alterations at relapse. Genomics of relapsed adult B-cell precursor ALL is highly heterogeneous, although some recurrent lesions involved in essential pathways deregulation were frequently observed. Selective and simultaneous targeting of these deregulated pathways may improve the results of current salvage therapies.","['Ribera, Jordi', 'Zamora, Lurdes', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Mallo, Mar',

Human cancer represents highly diverse genetics, as well as inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity, where cellular model systems capable of capturing this disease complexity would be invaluable. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents one of most heterogeneous cancers and has been divided into genetic subtypes correlated with unique risk stratification over the decades. Here, we report our efforts to induce pluripotency from the heterogeneous population of human patients that represents this disease in the clinic. Using robust optimized reprogramming methods, we demonstrate that reprogramming of AML cells harboring leukemic genomic aberrations is a rare event with the exception of those with de novo mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) mutations that can be reprogrammed and model drug responses in vitro. Our findings indicate that unlike hematopoietic cells devoid of genomic aberrations, AML cells harboring driver mutations are refractory to reprogramming. Expression of MLL fusion proteins in AML cells did not contribute to induced reprogramming success, which continued to select for patient derived cells devoid of AML patient-specific aberrations. Our study reveals that unanticipated blockades to achieving pluripotency reside within the majority of transformed AML patient cells.

Moreover, LIF has also been shown significantly to enhance the blastocyst formation rates of bovine embryos, a finding that remains controversial. Our purpose was to investigate time-dependent effect of LIF on bovine embryo culture, especially in terms of addition timing. Presumptive zygotes were cultured in five different groups. In this study, 100 ng/ml LIF was added to the culture medium were as follows; control: SOF alone, group A: at day 0 (fertilization day), group B: at day 4 post-insemination (p.i.), group C: at day 4 to 7 (p.i. before vitrification) and group D: at day 8 (p.i. after thawing). Addition of LIF to the culture medium at day 4 significantly increased the percentage of blastocyst rate when compared day 0, day 4 at 6/7 and control group (41.8% versus 24.3%, 19.7%, 34.6%). In conclusion, the addition of LIF only on day 4 (p.i.) to the culture medium was found to be beneficial for bovine embryonic development based on several measures, including blastocysts rate, re-expansion rate and cellular cryotolerance after vitrification.","['Kocyigit, A', 'Cevik, M']","['Kocyigit A', 'Cevik M']","['Departments of Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey.', 'Departments of Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170730,Germany,Reprod Domest Anim,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,9015668,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*cytology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival', 'Cryopreservation/veterinary', 'Culture Media', 'Embryo Culture Techniques/veterinary', 'Embryonic Development/*drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', '*Vitrification']",['NOTNLM'],"['Leucemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', 'cryotolerance', 'embryo culture', 'time-dependent effect']",2017/08/02 06:00,2018/08/25 06:00,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/rda.13040 [doi]'],ppublish,Reprod Domest Anim. 2017 Dec;52(6):1113-1119. doi: 10.1111/rda.13040.

METHODS: Leukemia patients with histologically confirmed hematologic malignancies were reviewed. We evaluated for CPET, between receiving chemotherapy and undergoing stem cell transplantation after 2 weeks. We recorded exercise testing and physiologic parameters during CPET between January 2013 to May 2015. All patients were subjected to symptoms limited to exercise testing, according to the Modified Bruce Protocol. We considered that if respiratory exchange ratio achieved was over 1.10, participants had successfully completed CPET. We dichotomized all participants into two groups (normal group, normal range of resting heart rate; higher group, over 100 per minute of heart rate). RESULTS: 30 patients were finally enrolled. All participants had no adverse effects during the exercise test. Mean peak double product was 26,998.60 mmHg.beats/min (range, 15,481-41,004), and mean peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) was 22.52+/-4.56 mL/kg/min. Significant differences were observed in the normal group with VO2 peak (mean, 24.21 mL/kg/min; p=0.027) and number of prior intensive chemotherapy, compared to the higher group (mean, 1.95; p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that CPET in leukemia patients before stem cell transplantation was very safe, and is an efficient method to screen for patients with poor cardiac functions. As CPET presents the parameters which reveal the cardiopulmonary functions, including VO2 peak, double product and exercise capacity, this exercise test would help to predict the physical performance or general condition of the leukemia patients.","['Kim, Soojae', 'Song, Ik-Chan', 'Jee, Sungju']","['Kim S', 'Song IC', 'Jee S']","['Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170629,Korea (South),Ann Rehabil Med,Annals of rehabilitation medicine,101573065,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Exercise test', 'Feasibility studies', 'Leukemia', 'Rehabilitation', 'Tachycardia']",2017/08/02 06:00,2017/08/02 06:01,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5535/arm.2017.41.3.456 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Rehabil Med. 2017 Jun;41(3):456-464. doi: 10.5535/arm.2017.41.3.456.

In contrast to Imatinib, Nilotinib was found to upregulate pro-atherogenic adhesion-proteins (ICAM-1, E-selectin, VCAM-1) on human endothelial cells. Nilotinib also suppressed endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube-formation and bound to a distinct set of target-kinases, relevant to angiogenesis and atherosclerosis, including angiopoietin receptor-1 TEK, ABL-2, JAK1 and MAP-kinases. Nilotinib and siRNA against ABL-2 also suppressed KDR expression. In addition, Nilotinib augmented atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice and blocked reperfusion and angiogenesis in a hindlimb-ischemia model of arterial occlusion, whereas Imatinib showed no comparable effects. Clinically overt AOD-events were found to accumulate over time in Nilotinib-treated patients. After a median observation-time of 2.0 years, the AOD-frequency was higher in these patients (29.4%) compared to risk factor- and age-matched controls (<5%). Together, Nilotinib exerts direct pro-atherogenic and anti-angiogenic effects on vascular endothelial cells, which may contribute to development of AOD in patients with CML.","['Hadzijusufovic, E', 'Albrecht-Schgoer, K', 'Huber, K', 'Hoermann, G', 'Grebien, F', 'Eisenwort, G', 'Schgoer, W', 'Herndlhofer, S', 'Kaun, C', 'Theurl, M', 'Sperr, W R', 'Rix, U', 'Sadovnik, I', 'Jilma, B', 'Schernthaner, G H', 'Wojta, J', 'Wolf, D', 'Superti-Furga, G', 'Kirchmair, R', 'Valent, P']","['Hadzijusufovic E', 'Albrecht-Schgoer K', 'Huber K', 'Hoermann G', 'Grebien F', 'Eisenwort G', 'Schgoer W', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Kaun C', 'Theurl M', 'Sperr WR', 'Rix U', 'Sadovnik I', 'Jilma B', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Wojta J', 'Wolf D', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Kirchmair R', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department/Clinic for Companion Animals and Horses, Clinic for Small Animals, Clinical Unit of Internal Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Cardiology and Angiology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department for Pharmacology and Genetics, Division of Translational Cell Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Cardiology and Angiology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Cardiology and Angiology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Angiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical Clinic 3, Oncology, Hematology and Rheumatology, University Clinic Bonn (UKB), Bonn, Germany.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Cardiology and Angiology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170731,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/genetics', 'Atherosclerosis/chemically induced', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Vascular Diseases/*chemically induced']",,,2017/08/02 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017245 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.245 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2388-2397. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.245.

An unweighted genetic risk score (uGRS) for the prediction of insulin resistance, consisting of 10 multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms, has been proposed. We evaluated uGRS predictivity in 61 CML patients treated with nilotinib. Patients were genotyped for IRS1, GRB14, ARL15, PPARG, PEPD, ANKRD55/MAP3K1, PDGFC, LYPLAL1, RSPO3, and FAM13A1 genes. The uGRS was based on the sum of the risk alleles within the set of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Molecular response (MR)(3.0) and MR(4.0) were achieved in 90% and 79% of patients, respectively. Before treatment, none of the patients had abnormal blood glucose. During treatment and subsequent follow-up at 80.2 months (range: 1-298), seven patients (11.5%) had developed diabetes that required oral treatment, a median of 14 months (range: 3-98) after starting nilotinib treatment. Twelve patients (19.7%) had developed prediabetes. Prediabetes/diabetes-free survival was significantly higher in patients with a uGRS <10 than in those with higher scores (100% vs. 22.8 +/- 12.4%, p <0.001). Each increment of one unit in the uGRS caused a 42% increase in the prediabetes/diabetes risk (hazard ratio = 1.42, confidence interval: 1.04-1.94, p = 0.026). The presence of more than 10 allelic variants associated with insulin secretion, processing, sensitivity, and clearance is predictive of prediabetes/diabetes development in CML patients treated with nilotinib. In clinical practice, uGRS could help tailor the best tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.","['Martino, Bruno', 'Mammi, Corrado', 'Labate, Claudia', 'Rodi, Silvia', 'Ielo, Domenica', 'Priolo, Manuela', 'Postorino, Maurizio', 'Tripepi, Giovanni', 'Ronco, Francesca', 'Lagana, Carmelo', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Greco, Marianna', 'La Nasa, Giorgio', 'Caocci, Giovanni']","['Martino B', 'Mammi C', 'Labate C', 'Rodi S', 'Ielo D', 'Priolo M', 'Postorino M', 'Tripepi G', 'Ronco F', 'Lagana C', 'Musolino C', 'Greco M', 'La Nasa G', 'Caocci G']","['Operative Unit of Hematology, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Medical Genetics, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Medical Genetics, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Medical Genetics, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Hematology, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Medical Genetics, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Nephrology, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'CNR-IBIM, Epidemiology Research Unit and Clinical Pathophysiology of Renal Disease and Hypertension, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Hematology, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Medical Genetics, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.

This study examined the cecal microbiome of chickens infected with avian leukosis virus (ALV) using 16S rRNA genes Illumina sequencing. One-day-old specific pathogen free chicks were inoculated in the abdomen with subgroup J or K of ALV. At 21-day-old, chickens positive for ALV viremia were selected and their cecal contents were extracted and examined for the composition of gut microflora by illumina sequencing of the V3+V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes. The results showed that there is a clear association with loss of important bacterial populations in concert with an enrichment of potentially pathogenic populations and ALV infections, despite of the virus subgroups. In addition, ALV-K infected chickens revealed a preference for opportunistic pathogens in Firmicutes such as Staphylococcus and Weissella and some genus from Bacillales. Whereas, ALV-J infected chickens were characterized by a larger number of notable pathogens like Escherichia-Shigella from Proteobacteria, and other condition pathogens including Enterococcus and members of Erysipelotrichaceae from Firmicutes, and members of Helicobacteraceae from Bacteroidetes. Collectively, our results suggest that relative abundance data from the cecal microbiome differentiates healthy chickens from those infected with ALVs. Most importantly, there was a significant difference in the gut microbiome of chickens infected with ALV-K compared to those with ALV-J infected ones. This strongly suggests that ALV infection may be associated with the microbiome and there may be multiple underlying mechanisms by which the microbiome is involved in the pathogenisis of different subgroup of ALV infections.","['Ma, Xinxin', 'Wang, Qi', 'Li, Hongmei', 'Xu, Chuantian', 'Cui, Ning', 'Zhao, Xiaomin']","['Ma X', 'Wang Q', 'Li H', 'Xu C', 'Cui N', 'Zhao X']","['Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control & Breeding, Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China; Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province, 271018, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province, 271018, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province, 271018, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control & Breeding, Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China; Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province, 271018, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control & Breeding, Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China; Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province, 271018, China.

Caspofungin is the first approved inhibitor of fungal beta-1,3-glucan synthesis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of caspofungin in the treatment of IFD in patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data from the electronic medical records of 1118 inpatients who were admitted to 10 hospitals in China between 2013 and 2014 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were hematologic disorder and IFD diagnosed during the hospitalization, based on clinical manifestations or evidence of pulmonary invasion, as well as caspofungin treatment for at least 7 days. The primary end point was the favorable response rate at the end of caspofungin as initial therapy for proven/probable/possible pulmonary IFD. The secondary end point was the survival rate after the completion of the caspofungin treatments. FINDINGS: A total of 704 patients were included, of whom 122 had IFD classified as probable/possible and 582 had unclassified IFD. The most frequent hematologic diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (42.8%), followed by acute lymphatic leukemia (18.8%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (8.8%), aplastic anemia (7.1%), and others (22.5%). The rates of favorable caspofungin response were 57.2% in all patients, 58.2% in the probable/possible IFD group, and 57.0% in the unclassified IFD group. Caspofungin as initial monotherapy led to a favorable response rate of 62.2% in the probable/possible IFD group. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed that not recovering from neutropenia during antifungal treatment, and advanced age, were significant factors for unfavorable outcomes. The overall IFD-related mortality rate was 4.1%. IMPLICATIONS: The results of our study show that caspofungin treatment of IFD in hematology patients was reasonable, with an overall rate of favorable response of 57.2% with each caspofungin treatment strategy.","['Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Hu, Jiong', 'Hu, Yu', 'Huang, He', 'Jin, Jie', 'Li, Juan', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Shao, Zonghong', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Quanshun', 'Wu, Depei', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Zhang X', 'Hu J', 'Hu Y', 'Huang H', 'Jin J', 'Li J', 'Liu Q', 'Shao Z', 'Wang J', 'Wang Q', 'Wu D', 'Huang X']","[""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.

By means of these catabolic end-products and by removal of pro-oxidant heme, HO-1 exerts antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and immune-modulating effects, leading to overall cytoprotective and beneficial functions in mammalian cells. Therefore, HO-1 is considered a survival molecule in various stress-related conditions. By contrast, growing evidence suggests that HO-1 is a survival-enhancing molecule also in various solid and blood cancers, such as various types of leukemia, promoting carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and chemo-resistance. Among leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is currently therapeutically well treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Imatinib (IM) and its congeners; nevertheless, resistance to all kinds of current drugs persist in a number of patients. Moreover, treatment outcomes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unsatisfactory, despite progress in chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therefore, identification of new eligible targets that may improve leukemias therapy is of general interest. Several recent papers prove that inhibition of HO-1 through HO-1 inhibitors as well as modulation of other pathways involving HO-1 by a number of different new or known molecules, are critical for leukemia treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pro-tumorigenic role of HO-1 and its potential as a molecular target for the treatment of leukemias.","['Salerno, Loredana', 'Romeo, Giuseppe', 'Modica, Maria N', 'Amata, Emanuele', 'Sorrenti, Valeria', 'Barbagallo, Ignazio', 'Pittala, Valeria']","['Salerno L', 'Romeo G', 'Modica MN', 'Amata E', 'Sorrenti V', 'Barbagallo I', 'Pittala V']","['Dipartimento di Scienze del Farmaco, Sezione di Chimica Farmaceutica, Universita di Catania, viale A.

Despite aggressive treatment with multidrug combination chemotherapies, ATL confers a poor prognosis and commonly develops resistance to conventional treatments. Areas covered: Mogamulizumab is a humanized, defucosylated monoclonal antibody that acts by targeting the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) on malignant cells of ATL. In phase I and II clinical trials, it has achieved overall response rates of 31-50% in CCR4+ malignancies. The most commonly observed hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events included lymphocytopenia, neutropenia, leukocytopenia, infusion reaction, rash, and pyrexia. Expert commentary: Mogamulizumab has shown significant efficacy in treating ATL with moderately high response rates and has been approved in Japan for use in ATL. It may serve as a bridge therapy to achieve disease control prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It also offers potential for use in combination with conventional chemotherapy. Determining the optimal combination of mogamulizumab with conventional and novel therapies remains an important strategy to improve the prognosis of patients with ATL.","['Winsett, Frank T', 'Lewis, Daniel J', 'Duvic, Madeleine']","['Winsett FT', 'Lewis DJ', 'Duvic M']","['a University of Texas McGovern Medical School at Houston , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b School of Medicine , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c Department of Dermatology , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c Department of Dermatology , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170821,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Receptors, CCR4/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', '*CC Chemokine receptor 4', '*Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1', '*Peripheral T-cell lymphoma']",2017/08/02 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1361819 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Sep;10(9):757-760. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1361819.

Underlying mechanisms are explained and an overview of clinical experience with phase 1-3 studies is given. Immunotherapies discussed are antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs). Most of the clinical studies reviewed are in ALL patients, usually in the relapse setting, but where available, studies on AML patients were also considered.

Previous studies indicated that ErbB4 (EGFR family member v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4) is essential for normal development and maintenance of the nervous system. In this study, we explored the neuroprotective effects of ErbB4 and its downstream YAP (yes-associated protein)/PIK3CB signaling pathway in early brain injury after SAH in a rat model using the endovascular perforation method. Rats were neurologically evaluated with the Modified Garcia Scale and beam balance test at 24h and 72h after SAH. An ErbB4 activator Neuregulin 1beta1 (Nrg 1beta1), ErbB4 siRNA and YAP siRNA were used to explore this pathway. The expression of p-ErbB4 and YAP was significantly increased after SAH. Multiple immunofluorescence labeling experiments demonstrated that ErbB4 is mainly expressed in neurons. Activation of ErbB4 and its downstream signals improved the neurological deficits after SAH and significantly reduced neuronal cell death. Inhibition of ErbB4 reduced YAP and PIK3CB expression, and aggravated cell apoptosis. YAP knockdown reduced the PIK3CB level and eliminated the anti-apoptotic effects of ErbB4 activation. These findings indicated that ErbB4 plays a neuroprotective role in early brain injury after SAH, possibly via the YAP/PIK3CB signaling pathway.","['Yan, Feng', 'Tan, Xiaoxiao', 'Wan, Weifeng', 'Dixon, Brandon J', 'Fan, Ruiming', 'Enkhjargal, Budbazar', 'Li, Qian', 'Zhang, Jianmin', 'Chen, Gao', 'Zhang, John H']","['Yan F', 'Tan X', 'Wan W', 'Dixon BJ', 'Fan R', 'Enkhjargal B', 'Li Q', 'Zhang J', 'Chen G', 'Zhang JH']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Loma Linda University, School of Medicine, CA, USA; Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Loma Linda University, School of Medicine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Loma Linda University, School of Medicine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Loma Linda University, School of Medicine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Loma Linda University, School of Medicine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Loma Linda University, School of Medicine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.

Under hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are stabilized and they coordinate the process of hypoxia-induced gene expression and cell signaling leading to increased tumor growth. Recent studies indicate that non-coding RNAs which are closely associated with cancer are abnormally expressed under hypoxia. Here, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of a cancer associated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), HOTAIR, under hypoxic conditions. Our studies demonstrate that HOTAIR expression is upregulated under hypoxia in colon cancer and several other types of cancer cells. HOTAIR transcription is regulated by HIF1alpha which binds to the hypoxia response elements (HRE) present in the HOTAIR promoter under hypoxia. HIF1alpha knockdown results in decreased HOTAIR expression under hypoxia. Along with HIF1alpha, histone methylases MLL1 and histone acetylase p300 are enriched at the HOTAIR promoter under hypoxia. The levels of H3K4-trimethylation and histone acetylation are also enriched at the HOTAIR promoter. Furthermore, knockdown of MLL1 downregulated the hypoxia-induced HOTAIR expression, indicating key roles of MLL1 in hypoxia-induced HOTAIR expression. Overall, our studies demonstrate that histone methyl-transferase MLL1 coordinates with HIF1alpha and histone acetyltransferase p300 and regulate hypoxia-induced HOTAIR expression. The hypoxia-induced upregulation of HOTAIR expression may contribute to its roles in tumorigenesis.","['Bhan, Arunoday', 'Deb, Paromita', 'Shihabeddin, Nadine', 'Ansari, Khairul I', 'Brotto, Marco', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Bhan A', 'Deb P', 'Shihabeddin N', 'Ansari KI', 'Brotto M', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, United States.', 'College of Nursing and Health Innovation, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, United States.

Although current treatment protocols for T-ALL have improved overall survival, a portion of T-ALL patients still experiences treatment failure. Thus, the development of novel therapies is needed. In this study, we used several patient-derived T-ALL cell lines to screen for an effective drug for T-ALL. Using a panel of 378 inhibitors against different kinases, we identified the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib as a potential drug for T-ALL. Dinaciclib treatment significantly reduced cell viability and completely blocked colony formation. Furthermore, cells treated with dinaciclib showed decreased expression of several pro-survival proteins including survivin, cyclin T1 and c-MYC. Dinaciclib treatment also increased accumulation of cells in G2/M phase and significantly induced apoptosis. Finally, dinaciclib extended survival of mice in a T-ALL cell xenograft model. Collectively, these data suggest that the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib is an active drug for T-ALL in the preclinical settings.","['Moharram, Sausan A', 'Shah, Kinjal', 'Khanum, Fatima', 'Marhall, Alissa', 'Gazi, Mohiuddin', 'Kazi, Julhash U']","['Moharram SA', 'Shah K', 'Khanum F', 'Marhall A', 'Gazi M', 'Kazi JU']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Besides the abundance in multiple organs, the molecular mechanism underlying the LIF interactions for cell survival and polarity is poorly understood. In the present study, high-resolution LC-MS/MS based LFQ approach identified 2083 proteins with the overall PSM as 16,032. This proteomics data reviles that LIF promotes the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. It induces cell growth arrest by an intracellular pathways loop to increase the half-life of the cell. Bioinformatics-based enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of LIF interacting partners in cell survival through increasing the cell cycle length. The anti-proliferative effect of LIF was confirmed by BrdU, MTT and Caspase 3/7 assays and further validated by RT-qPCR. Till date to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that elucidates LIF-mediated cascade of activation of MEK/ERK, Ras, mTOR, Hippo, and RAP1 pathways. This study further expands the repertoire of signaling pathways known to be subject to activation by LIF. These multiple involvements of pathways through autocrine-paracrine mediated cell cycle arrest additionally suggests a novel means for amplification of a growth arrest stimulus from LIF and its homolog's receptors. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is the polyfunctional cytokine and highly pleiotropic member of the interleukin-6 family. It utilizes a receptor that consists of the LIF receptor b and gp130 and displays diverse effects on target cells. Despite well-known signal transduction mechanisms (JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K) LIF also contains paradoxically opposing influences in several cell types which includes cellular stimulation, inhibition, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. LIF1 is also undergoing clinical trials as a driving force for the embryo implantation in the uterus in women who fail to become pregnant. As LIF can act on the broad spectrum of cell types, it is necessary to understand the basic response mechanism. The available non-canonical regulatory pathways and molecular mechanism associated with LIF are poorly explained. Therefore, we have performed the global proteome analysis of LIF-mediated autocrine-paracrine signaling. The obtained data were examined through advanced bioinformatics tools and LIF inducible changes in terms of pathways were elucidated. The result showed the involvement of cluster of proteins maintaining the Ras/Rap1/STAT3/Hippo pathways which modify the protein component machinery of core histone complexes. This report describes the involvement of proteins responsible for cell growth and progression and defines the LIF-mediated novel autocrine-paracrine signaling loop for cell growth arrest.","['Ali, Syed Azmal', 'Kaur, Gurjeet', 'Kaushik, Jai Kumar', 'Malakar, Dhruba', 'Mohanty, Ashok Kumar', 'Kumar, Sudarshan']","['Ali SA', 'Kaur G', 'Kaushik JK', 'Malakar D', 'Mohanty AK', 'Kumar S']","['Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.

Unrecognized cases of abuse may lead to insufficient child protection, whereas, on the other hand, over-diagnosis could be the cause of various problems for the family and their potentially accused members. Regarding child abuse, numerous cases of false diagnoses with undetected causes of bleeding are described in the scientific literature, but, specifically concerning leukemia in childhood, only very few case reports exist. Here, for the first time, we report a case of a 2-year-old boy who got hospitalized twice because of suspicious injuries and psychosocial conspicuities, in a family situation known for repeated endangerment of the child's well-being. After his first hospitalization with injuries typical for child abuse, but without paraclinical abnormalities, medical inspections were arranged periodically. The child was hospitalized with signs of repeated child abuse again five months later. During second admission, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia was revealed by intermittent laboratory examination, ordered due to new bruises with changes in morphology, identifiable as petechial hemorrhages. This case elucidates the discussion of known cases of leukemia in childhood associated with suspected child abuse in order to provide an overview of possible diseases mimicking maltreatment. To arrange necessary supportive examinations, a skillful interaction between pediatrician and forensic pathologist is crucial in the differentiation between accidental and non-accidental injury.","['Woydt, L', 'Konig, C', 'Bernhard, M K', 'Nickel, P', 'Dressler, J', 'Ondruschka, B']","['Woydt L', 'Konig C', 'Bernhard MK', 'Nickel P', 'Dressler J', 'Ondruschka B']","['Institute of Legal Medicine, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Legal Medicine, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Centre for Paediatric Research, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Centre for Paediatric Research, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Legal Medicine, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Legal Medicine, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Germany.

Although this is a short series, MoM resurfaced hips with appropriate case selection can yield satisfactory short-term to intermediate-term results in the young and active patients with abnormal hip anatomy.","['Sharma, H', 'Campbell, A C', 'Thajam, S', 'Singh, B J']","['Sharma H', 'Campbell AC', 'Thajam S', 'Singh BJ']","['Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Monklands Hospital, ML6 0JS, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, UK. hksharma1@aol.com.', ', 44 Abercorn Road, Newton Mearns, Glasgow, G77 6NA, UK. hksharma1@aol.com.', 'Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Monklands Hospital, ML6 0JS, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, UK.', 'Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Monklands Hospital, ML6 0JS, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, UK.', 'Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Monklands Hospital, ML6 0JS, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20051213,France,Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol,European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,9518037,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anatomy', 'Arthroplasty', 'Hip', 'Metal-on-metal']",2006/06/01 00:00,2006/06/01 00:01,['2017/07/30 06:00'],"['2005/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00590-005-0061-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00590-005-0061-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol. 2006 Jun;16(2):135-139. doi: 10.1007/s00590-005-0061-0.

Integrative models for risk assessment are lacking. We sought to develop a scoring system for prediction of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years following UCBT in AL patients.Experimental Design: The study cohort included 3,140 pediatric and adult AL UCBT patients from the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Eurocord registries. Patients received single or double cord blood units. The dataset was geographically split into a derivation (n = 2,362, 65%) and validation set (n = 778, 35%). Top predictors of OS were identified using the Random Survival Forest algorithm and introduced into a Cox regression model, which served for the construction of the UCBT risk score.Results: The score includes nine variables: disease status, diagnosis, cell dose, age, center experience, cytomegalovirus serostatus, degree of HLA mismatch, previous autograft, and anti-thymocyte globulin administration. Over the validation set an increasing score was associated with decreasing probabilities for 2 years OS and LFS, ranging from 70.21% [68.89-70.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)] and 64.76% (64.33-65.86, 95% CI) to 14.78% (10.91-17.41) and 18.11% (14.40-22.30), respectively. It stratified patients into six distinct risk groups. The score's discrimination (AUC) over multiple imputations of the validation set was 68.76 (68.19-69.04, range) and 65.78 (65.20-66.28) for 2 years OS and LFS, respectively.Conclusions: The UCBT score is a simple tool for risk stratification of AL patients undergoing UCBT. Widespread application of the score will require further independent validation. Clin Cancer Res; 23(21); 6478-86.

Recent progress has advanced our knowledge of this scarring process, but the detailed mechanism of liver fibrosis is far from clear. METHODS: The fibrotic specimens of patients and HLF (hepatic leukemia factor)(PB/PB) mice were used to assess the expression and role of HLF in liver fibrosis. Primary murine hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and human HSC line Lx2 were used to investigate the impact of HLF on HSC activation and the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Expression of HLF was detected in fibrotic livers of patients, but it was absent in the livers of healthy individuals. Intriguingly, HLF expression was confined to activated HSCs rather than other cell types in the liver. The loss of HLF impaired primary HSC activation and attenuated liver fibrosis in HLF(PB/PB) mice. Consistently, ectopic HLF expression significantly facilitated the activation of human HSCs. Mechanistic studies revealed that upregulated HLF transcriptionally enhanced interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression and intensified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, thus promoting HSC activation. Coincidentally, IL-6/STAT3 signalling in turn activated HLF expression in HSCs, thus completing a feedforward regulatory circuit in HSC activation. Moreover, correlation between HLF expression and alpha-smooth muscle actin, IL-6 and p-STAT3 levels was observed in patient fibrotic livers, supporting the role of HLF/IL-6/STAT3 cascade in liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, we delineate a paradigm of HLF/IL-6/STAT3 regulatory circuit in liver fibrosis and propose that HLF is a novel biomarker for activated HSCs and a potential target for antifibrotic therapy.","['Xiang, Dai-Min', 'Sun, Wen', 'Ning, Bei-Fang', 'Zhou, Teng-Fei', 'Li, Xiao-Feng', 'Zhong, Wei', 'Cheng, Zhuo', 'Xia, Ming-Yang', 'Wang, Xue', 'Deng, Xing', 'Wang, Wei', 'Li,

To understand the mechanism driving protumorigenic skewing in CLL, we evaluated the role of tumor cell-derived exosomes in the cross-talk with monocytes. We carried out RNA sequencing and proteome analyses of CLL-derived exosomes and identified noncoding Y RNA hY4 as a highly abundant RNA species that is enriched in exosomes from plasma of CLL patients compared with healthy donor samples. Transfer of CLL-derived exosomes or hY4 alone to monocytes resulted in key CLL-associated phenotypes, including the release of cytokines, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL4, and interleukin-6, and the expression of PD-L1. These responses were abolished in Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-deficient monocytes, suggesting exosomal hY4 as a driver of TLR7 signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of endosomal TLR signaling resulted in a substantially reduced activation of monocytes in vitro and attenuated CLL development in vivo. Our results indicate that exosome-mediated transfer of noncoding RNAs to monocytes contributes to cancer-related inflammation and concurrent immune escape via PD-L1 expression.","['Haderk, Franziska', 'Schulz, Ralph', 'Iskar, Murat', 'Cid, Laura Llao', 'Worst, Thomas', 'Willmund, Karolin V', 'Schulz, Angela', 'Warnken, Uwe', 'Seiler, Jana', 'Benner, Axel', 'Nessling, Michelle', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Gobel, Maria', 'Durig, Jan', 'Diederichs, Sven', 'Paggetti, Jerome', 'Moussay, Etienne', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Zapatka, Marc', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['Haderk F', 'Schulz R', 'Iskar M', 'Cid LL', 'Worst T', 'Willmund KV', 'Schulz A', 'Warnken U', 'Seiler J', 'Benner A', 'Nessling M', 'Zenz T', 'Gobel M', 'Durig J', 'Diederichs S', 'Paggetti J', 'Moussay E', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Zapatka M', 'Lichter P', 'Seiffert M']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Signaling and Functional Genomics, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of RNA Biology and Cancer (B150), DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Central Unit Electron Microscopy, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Hematology and Oncology and Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT); DKFZ; and Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of RNA Biology and Cancer (B150), DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Department of Thoracic Surgery, Medical Center-Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. m.seiffert@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Sci Immunol,Science immunology,101688624,,,,,,2017/07/30 06:00,2017/07/30 06:01,['2017/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['2/13/eaah5509 [pii]', '10.1126/sciimmunol.aah5509 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Immunol. 2017 Jul 28;2(13). pii: 2/13/eaah5509. doi: 10.1126/sciimmunol.aah5509.,,"['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

As HLA disparity may contribute to the graft-versus-tumor effect, utilizing new mismatched haplotype donors may potentially improve the antitumor activity for relapsed hematologic malignancies despite a previous alloBMT. Data from patients who received a second alloBMT for relapsed hematologic malignancies at Johns Hopkins were analyzed. Outcomes were compared between patients who received a second allograft with the same MHC composition and those who received an allograft with a new mismatched haplotype. Loss of heterozygosity analysis was performed for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose first allograft was haploidentical. Between 2005 and 2015, 40 patients received a second BMT for a relapsed hematologic malignancy. The median follow-up is 750 (range, 26 to 2950) days. The median overall survival (OS) in the cohort is 928 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 602 to not reached [NR]); median event-free survival (EFS) for the cohort is 500 days (95% CI, 355 to NR). The 4-year OS is 40% (95% CI, 25% to 64%), and the 4-year EFS is 36% (95% CI, 24% to 55%). The cumulative incidence of nonrelapsed mortality by 2 years was 27% (95% CI, 13% to 42%). The cumulative incidence of grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 15% (95% CI, 4% to 26%); the cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD at 2 years was 22% (95% CI, 9% to 36%). The median survival was 552 days (95% CI, 376 to 2950+) in the group who underwent transplantation with a second allograft that did not harbor a new mismatched haplotype, while it was not reached in the group whose allograft contained a new mismatched haplotype (hazard ratio [HR], .36; 95% CI, .14 to .9; P = .02). EFS was also longer in the group who received an allograft containing a new mismatched haplotype, (NR versus 401 days; HR, .50; 95% CI, .22 to 1.14; P = .09). Although the allograft for this patient's second BMT contained a new mismatched haplotype, AML nevertheless relapsed a second time. Second BMTs are feasible and provide a reasonable chance of long-term survival.

We aimed to confirm these findings in patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation using a tablet formulation of olaparib. METHODS: This international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial evaluated olaparib tablet maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation who had received at least two lines of previous chemotherapy. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at baseline of 0-1 and histologically confirmed, relapsed, high-grade serous ovarian cancer or high-grade endometrioid cancer, including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to olaparib (300 mg in two 150 mg tablets, twice daily) or matching placebo tablets using an interactive voice and web response system. Randomisation was stratified by response to previous platinum chemotherapy (complete vs partial) and length of platinum-free interval (6-12 months vs >/=12 months) and treatment assignment was masked for patients, those giving the interventions, data collectors, and data analysers. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival and we report the primary analysis from this ongoing study. The efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01874353, and is ongoing and no longer recruiting patients. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2013, and Nov 21, 2014, we enrolled 295 eligible patients who were randomly assigned to receive olaparib (n=196) or placebo (n=99). One patient in the olaparib group was randomised in error and did not receive study treatment. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was significantly longer with olaparib (19.1 months [95% CI 16.3-25.7]) than with placebo (5.5 months [5.2-5.8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.30 [95% CI 0.22-0.41], p<0.0001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity were anaemia (38 [19%] of 195 patients in the olaparib group vs two [2%] of 99 patients in the placebo group), fatigue or asthenia (eight [4%] vs two [2%]), and neutropenia (ten [5%] vs four [4%]). Serious adverse events were experienced by 35 (18%) patients in the olaparib group and eight (8%) patients in the placebo group. The most common in the olaparib group were anaemia (seven [4%] patients), abdominal pain (three [2%] patients), and intestinal obstruction (three [2%] patients). The most common in the placebo group were constipation (two [2%] patients) and intestinal obstruction (two [2%] patients). One (1%) patient in the olaparib group had a treatment-related adverse event (acute myeloid leukaemia) with an outcome of death. INTERPRETATION: Olaparib tablet maintenance treatment provided a significant progression-free survival improvement with no detrimental effect on quality of life in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation. Apart from anaemia, toxicities with olaparib were low grade and manageable.

In this study, we have investigated the acute bio-activation of NSAIDs and their metabolites via myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly-expressed peroxidase enzyme in acute myeloid leukemia. As bio-activation involves the formation of reactive metabolites, we hypothesized that NSAIDs which produced reactive metabolites would be correlated with leukemia cell toxicity. We tested the enzymatic peroxidation of three NSAIDs, namely diclofenac, indomethacin, and naproxen in comparison with their hepatic metabolites, 4'- hydroxydiclofenac (4'-OHD), 5-hydroxydiclofenac (5-OHD), O-desmethyl-N-deschlorobenzoylindomethacin (DMBI), O-desmethylindomethacin (DMI) and O-desmethylnaproxen (ODN). Firstly, we used purified peroxidases in kinetic UV-vis kinetic spectrophotometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments to determine oxidation of ascorbic acid and glutathione (GSH), respectively. We then used HL-60 cells, as a model of acute myelogenous leukemia to carry out trypan blue exclusion, cellular ATP analysis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cytofluorometric GSH assays. Our results present evidence that diclofenac, 4'-OHD, 5-OHD, DMBI and DMI demonstrated significant cytotoxic effect in the leukemic cells through oxidation by intracellular MPO. In the same vein, only diclofenac and its two metabolites caused a significant drop in the MMP and cellular ATP level; however, the cell death induced by indomethacin metabolites reflected a subtle effect on MMP or GSH content. Interestingly, only diclofenac and 4'-OHD (and not 5- OHD) caused a significant drop in HL-60 cells' GSH content. Among diclofenac compounds, only 4'-OHD also generated GS radical and caused a significant increase in ascorbate co-oxidation rate. Lastly, even though ODN also generated GS radical and potently cooxidized ascorbate, it showed no significant cytotoxicity. These results provide evidence of a correlation between acute cytotoxicity and MPO-bioactivated NSAIDs, though this was not correlated for all compounds (e.g., ODN). Further studies are required to determine both the MPO-dependent and MPO-independent mechanisms of cytotoxicity.","['Morgan, Andrew G M', 'Babu, Dinesh', 'Michail, Karim', 'Siraki, Arno G']","['Morgan AGM', 'Babu D', 'Michail K', 'Siraki AG']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada; Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

Herein, we evaluated the impact of steviol, steviol glycosides, and a Greek-derived stevia extract on a number of key steps of GR signaling cascade in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in Jurkat leukemia cells. Our results revealed that none of the tested compounds altered the expression of primary GR-target genes (GILZ, FKPB5), GR protein levels or GR subcellular localization in PBMCs; those compounds increased GILZ and FKPB5 mRNA levels as well as GRE-mediated luciferase activity, inducing in parallel GR nuclear translocation in Jurkat cells. The GR-modulatory activity demonstrated by stevia-compounds in Jurkat cells but not in PBMCs may be due to a cell-type specific effect.","['Panagiotou, Christina', 'Mihailidou, Chrysovalantou', 'Brauhli, George', 'Katsarou, Olga', 'Moutsatsou, Paraskevi']","['Panagiotou C', 'Mihailidou C', 'Brauhli G', 'Katsarou O', 'Moutsatsou P']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, University General Hospital ""ATTIKO"", Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'ANTHIR S.A.

Many aspects of HTLV-1 replication, including virus particle structure and assembly, are poorly understood. Group-specific antigen (Gag) proteins labeled at the carboxy terminus with a fluorophore protein have been used extensively as a surrogate for fluorescence studies of retroviral assembly. How these tags affect Gag stoichiometry and particle morphology has not been reported in detail. In this study, we used an HTLV-1 Gag expression construct with the yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) fused to the carboxy-terminus as a surrogate for the HTLV-1 Gag-Pol to assess the effects of co-packaging of Gag and a Gag-YFP on virus-like particle (VLP) morphology and analyzed particles by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) were also used to determine the Gag stoichiometry. We found that ratios of 3:1 (Gag:Gag-YFP) or greater resulted in a particle morphology indistinguishable from that of VLPs produced with the untagged HTLV-1 Gag, i.e., a mean diameter of ~113 nm and a mass of 220 MDa as determined by cryo-TEM and STEM, respectively. Furthermore, FFS analysis indicated that HTLV-1 Gag-YFP was incorporated into VLPs in a predictable manner at the 3:1 Gag:Gag-YFP ratio. Both STEM and FFS analyses found that the Gag copy number in VLPs produced with a 3:1 ratio of Gag:Gag-YFP was is in the range of 1500-2000 molecules per VLP. The observations made in this study indicate that biologically relevant Gag-Gag interactions occur between Gag and Gag-YFP at ratios of 3:1 or higher and create a Gag lattice structure in VLPs that is morphologically indistinguishable from that of VLPs produced with just untagged Gag. This information is useful for the quantitative analysis of Gag-Gag interactions that occur during virus particle assembly and in released immature particles.","['Maldonado, Jose O', 'Angert, Isaac', 'Cao, Sheng', 'Berk, Serkan', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Mueller, Joachim D', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Maldonado JO', 'Angert I', 'Cao S', 'Berk S', 'Zhang W', 'Mueller JD', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, D.D.S.-Ph.D. Dual Degree Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. jmaldo@umn.edu.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Institute for Molecular Virology Training Program, School of Physics & Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. ange0079@umn.edu.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Department of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. caosheng@wh.iov.cn.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. sberk@umn.edu.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Department of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, Characterization Facility, College of Science and Engineering, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. zhangwei@umn.edu.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, School of Physics & Astronomy, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mueller@physics.umn.edu.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mansky@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170719,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Virion/chemistry/ultrastructure', '*Virus Assembly']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gag stoichiometry', '*cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)', '*fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS)', '*human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', '*scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)']",2017/07/30 06:00,2018/03/29 06:00,['2017/07/30 06:00'],"['2017/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['v9070191 [pii]', '10.3390/v9070191 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2017 Jul 19;9(7). pii: v9070191. doi: 10.3390/v9070191.,"['F30 DE022286/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM098550/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI083196/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5537683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However the eradication of leukemia initiating cells remains a challenge. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the cytokine microenvironment may play a role in BCR-ABL mediated leukemogenesis and in imatinib resistance. Gene expression analyses of BCR-ABL positive ALL long-term cultured cells revealed strong reduction of SOCS mRNA expression after imatinib treatment, thereby demonstrating a strong inhibition of cytokine signaling. In this study we employed SOCS1-a strong inhibitor of cytokine signaling-as a tool to terminate external cytokine signals in BCR-ABL transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. In colony formation assays with primary bone marrow cells, expression of SOCS1 decreased colony numbers under pro-proliferative cytokines, while it conferred growth resistance to anti-proliferative cytokines. Importantly, co-expression of SOCS1 with BCR-ABL led to the development of a MPD phenotype with a prolonged disease latency compared to BCR-ABL alone in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Interestingly, SOCS1 co-expression protected 20% of mice from MPD development. In summary, we conclude that under pro-proliferative cytokine stimulation at the onset of myeloproliferative diseases SOCS1 acts as a tumor suppressor, while under anti-proliferative conditions it exerts oncogenic function. Therefore SOCS1 can promote opposing functions depending on the cytokine environment.","['Demirel, Ozlem', 'Ballo, Olivier', 'Reddy, Pavankumar N G', 'Vakhrusheva, Olesya', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Eichler, Astrid', 'Fernandes, Ramona', 'Badura, Susanne', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Brandts, Christian']","['Demirel O', 'Ballo O', 'Reddy PNG', 'Vakhrusheva O', 'Zhang J', 'Eichler A', 'Fernandes R', 'Badura S', 'Serve H', 'Brandts C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', ""Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States of America."", 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170728,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/07/29 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0180401 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-30216 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jul 28;12(7):e0180401. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0180401. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5533340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of SOCS1 in tumor carcinogenesis is complex and there have been no studies concerning the clinic-biologic implication of SOCS1 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we first identified that higher bone marrow (BM) SOCS1 expression was closely associated with older age, FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations, but negatively correlated with CEBPA mutation in patients with de novo AML. Compared to patients with lower SOCS1 expression, those with higher expression had lower complete remission rates and shorter overall survival. Further, higher expression of SOCS1 in the BM was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor irrespective of age, white blood cell, cytogenetics and gene mutations. Next, we generated zebrafish model overexpressing SOCS1 by spi1 promoter, which showed kidney marrow from adult SOCS1 zebrafish had increased myelopoiesis, myeloid progenitors and the kidney or spleen structure were effaced and distorted, mimicking leukemia phenotype. The SOCS1/FLT3-ITD double transgenic fish could further facilitate the leukemic process. The results indicate SOCS1 plays an important role in AML and its higher expression serves as a new biomarker to risk-stratify AML patients.","['Hou, H-A', 'Lu, J-W', 'Lin, T-Y', 'Tsai, C-H', 'Chou, W-C', 'Lin, C-C', 'Kuo, Y-Y', 'Liu, C-Y', 'Tseng, M-H', 'Chiang, Y-C', 'Peng, Y-L', 'Tang, J-L', 'Gong, Z', 'Lin, L-I', 'Tien, H-F']","['Hou HA', 'Lu JW', 'Lin TY', 'Tsai CH', 'Chou WC', 'Lin CC', 'Kuo YY', 'Liu CY', 'Tseng MH', 'Chiang YC', 'Peng YL', 'Tang JL', 'Gong Z', 'Lin LI', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Nursing, Biostatistics Consulting Laboratory, National Taipei College of Nursing, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170728,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (socs1a protein, zebrafish)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2017/07/29 06:00,2018/08/31 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201767 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2017.67 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2017 Jul 28;7(7):e588. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2017.67.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4174-8766'],PMC5549259,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanisms of oncogenesis are still largely unknown, there is clear experimental evidence showing that BLV infection drastically modifies the pattern of gene expression of the host cell. This alteration of the transcriptome in infected B-lymphocytes results first, from a direct activity of viral proteins (i.e. transactivation of gene promoters, protein-protein interactions), second, from insertional mutagenesis by proviral integration (cis-activation) and third, from gene silencing by microRNAs. Expression of viral proteins stimulates a vigorous immune response that indirectly modifies gene transcription in other cell types (e.g. cytotoxic T-cells, auxiliary T-cells, macrophages). In principle, insertional mutagenesis and microRNA-associated RNA interference can modify the cell fate without inducing an antiviral immunity. Despite a tight control by the immune response, the permanent attempts of the virus to replicate ultimately induce mutations in the infected cell. Accumulation of these genomic lesions and Darwinian selection of tumor clones are predicted to lead to cancer.","['Safari, Roghaiyeh', 'Hamaidia, Malik', 'de Brogniez, Alix', 'Gillet, Nicolas', 'Willems, Luc']","['Safari R', 'Hamaidia M', 'de Brogniez A', 'Gillet N', 'Willems L']","[""Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), 1 allee de l'Hopital, B34 Sart-Tilman, 4000 Liege, Belgium; Molecular Biology, Gemboux Agro-Bio Tech, 13 Avenue Marechal Juin, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium."", ""Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), 1 allee de l'Hopital, B34 Sart-Tilman, 4000 Liege, Belgium; Molecular Biology, Gemboux Agro-Bio Tech, 13 Avenue Marechal Juin, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium."", ""Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), 1 allee de l'Hopital, B34 Sart-Tilman, 4000 Liege, Belgium; Molecular Biology, Gemboux Agro-Bio Tech, 13 Avenue Marechal Juin, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium."", ""Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), 1 allee de l'Hopital, B34 Sart-Tilman, 4000 Liege, Belgium; Molecular Biology, Gemboux Agro-Bio Tech, 13 Avenue Marechal Juin, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium."", ""Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), 1 allee de l'Hopital, B34 Sart-Tilman, 4000 Liege, Belgium; Molecular Biology, Gemboux Agro-Bio Tech, 13 Avenue Marechal Juin, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium.

The INNA makes use of quantitative instruments, arising from the natural sciences as well as of qualitative ones, arising from the human achieving results of standardization and reproducibility, as well as of customization and uniqueness. Accordingly, the purpose of this work is to exemplify the thinking process of and the method adopted by a nurse adopting an integrated narrative assessment in the evaluation of a patient. METHOD: The patient suffered from acute myeloid leukaemia, treated with chemotherapy. Her nurse worked in a haematology ward in a North Italy Hospital. The nurse had previous experience in conducting the assessment according to INNA. Based on patient's characteristics, the nurse chose to use the narration (to explore needs from their subjective perception) and the scales (to measure them objectively) among the various assessment instruments provided by the INNA. RESULTS: The resultant integrated outcomes helped the nurse to have a comprehensive overview of the person's health-care needs and their connections. These outcomes derive from the integration of narrative information with those obtained from the scales, which in this paper have shown consistent results. CONCLUSION: It is very difficult to reach this complexity by considering qualitative and quantitative assessment strategies as mutually foreclosing, given that both emerged as being very useful in identifying, understanding and measuring the needs of the assisted person. Then they both could be used to design a customized intervention, encouraging new connections between disease, illness, sickness and everyday life.","['Artioli, Giovanna', 'Foa, Chiara', 'Cosentino, Chiara', 'Sollami, Alfonso', 'Taffurelli, Chiara']","['Artioli G', 'Foa C', 'Cosentino C', 'Sollami A', 'Taffurelli C']","['IRCCS (Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care), Santa Maria Nuova Hospital, Reggio Emilia, Italy.

Over the years, the interest of physicians, nurses, patients and caregivers has increasingly focused on the aspects of the humanization of care, the management of side effects and on the full and constant therapeutic adherence. The aim of the project was to define patient-oriented care processes, based on a proactive approach that can fully respond to the new health needs of CML patients. METHODS: A nursing expert Working Group (WG) was established. WG reviewed literature about CML patients assistance and then it was conducted a survey on organizational models for the treatment of CML patients, adopted by Italian haematologic and transplant centers. Finally, the main issues regarding CML patients care were identified and discussed on a multiprofessional basis. RESULTS: Euriclea Project for care of CML patients with the description of a new and expanded nurse role was defined. The Nurse Case Manager or Nursing Clinical Experts were identified as key people for the management of the side effects of treatment, the promotion of the therapeutic adherence and the evaluation of efficacy and effectiveness of the process through the identification of specific indicators for structure, process and outcome. DISCUSSION: The focal areas of the care process were identified so as to define a different approach to the CML patient, through a holistic view of care and the multidisciplinary interventions.","['Botti, Stefano', 'Gargiulo, Gianpaolo', 'Bombaci, Felice', 'Artioli, Giovanna', 'Cosentino, Chiara', 'Pignatelli, Adriana Concetta', 'Torino, Daniela', 'Lionetti, Maria Marcella', 'Samarani, Emanuela', 'Cappucciati, Lorella', 'Bordiga, Paola', 'Diodati, Antonella', 'Caffarri, Cristiana', 'Rosini, Irene', 'Pane, Fabrizio']","['Botti S', 'Gargiulo G', 'Bombaci F', 'Artioli G', 'Cosentino C', 'Pignatelli AC', 'Torino D', 'Lionetti MM', 'Samarani E', 'Cappucciati L', 'Bordiga P', 'Diodati A', 'Caffarri C', 'Rosini I', 'Pane F']","['Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy. stefano.botti@asmn.re.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170718,Italy,Acta Biomed,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,101295064,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Critical Pathways', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*nursing', 'Medication Adherence', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Nursing Assessment', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*clinical pathways, chronic myeloid leukaemia, tirosine chinase inhibitors,', 'nursing, proactive care, adherence, patient empowerment, side effects, adverse', 'events']",2017/07/29 06:00,2018/05/18 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.23750/abm.v88i3 -S.6608 [doi]'],epublish,Acta Biomed. 2017 Jul 18;88(3S):5-12. doi: 10.23750/abm.v88i3 -S.6608.,,,,PMC6357587,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Female ICR mice were randomly allocated into 2 groups: in curettage group, a blunt 20G needle was inserted in one uterine horn with 0.05 megapascals negative pressure; in coagulation group, one uterine horn was coagulated using a monopolar electric needle with 0.5 watts power. In both groups the contra-lateral uterine horn was used as control. The morphological changes and thickness of endometrium were evaluated 1 week after operation. The endometrial samples were taken on d4 of pregnancy, and the expressions of endometrial receptivity-related cytokines were examined. The number of implanted embryos on each side of uterus was calculated on d10 of pregnancy. Results: There was no difference in operation time between 2 groups. In both groups, the endometrial glands and stroma were significantly reduced, and the endometrial thickness was also significantly decreased on injury side compared to contra-lateral horn. However, local injury was more severe in coagulation group, uterine obliteration and hydrops were developed in 2 mice of coagulation group, and none in curettage group. The expressions of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM) were significantly reduced on injured side in both groups compared to opposite side; however, the expression of LIF and OSM in curettage group was higher than that in coagulation group. The numbers of implanted embryos were decreased in both groups on injured side compared to opposite side, and fetal death was only observed in coagulation group. Conclusion: Both curettage and coagulation can make injury on mouse endometrium, impair endometrial receptivity and reduce fertility. Curettage can cause moderate injury, and coagulation may lead to more severe injury.","['Yanpeng, Wang', 'Qiongxiao, Huang', 'Sheng, X U', 'Jing, Shu']","['Yanpeng W', 'Qiongxiao H', 'Sheng XU', 'Jing S']","[""Department of Gynecology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China; Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China. shujingone@aliyun.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

There have been studies involving small cohorts with conflicting results regarding the spectrum of B-CLPDs in China, and the types and immunophenotyping of B-CLPDs in China remain largely unexplored. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 653 cases of B-CLPDs seen in our centre from 2011 to 2015. Four-colour flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of each immunological marker, and the diagnostic values of the immunological markers were also investigated. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was the most common type of B-CLPD, which was consistent with that in west countries. However, the proportions of CLL (55.9%), follicular lymphoma (2.6%), and hairy cell leukaemia (0.2%) were lower, while the proportion of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/WaldenstrOm macroglobulinaemia (5.4%) was higher in China, as compared with western countries. With respect to immunophenotypic characteristics, CD23 (31.7%) was more frequently expressed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in our cohort than that in western countries. Immunophenotyping was useful in differentiating MCL from CLL or B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/WaldenstrOm macroglobulinaemia from splenic marginal zone lymphoma. CD200 was of better diagnostic performance (accuracy: 94.6%) in differentiating CLL from MCL compared with CD23 (accuracy: 93.3%). Some cases of B-CPLDs, however, had no definite diagnoses, which were diagnosed as CD5(+) B-CPLDs unclassified (7.7%) and CD5(-) B-CPLDs unclassified (15.8%). This is the largest study that systematically explores the spectrum and immunophenotyping of B-CLPDs in Asia, confirming that spectrum of B-CLPDs in China was different from that in western countries. The immunophenotypic features of B-CLPDs were similar between China and western countries, although a few disparities exist. Cases with no definite diagnoses warrant further studies in the future.","['Miao, Yi', 'Cao, Lei', 'Sun, Qian', 'Li, Xiao-Tong', 'Wang, Yan', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Wang, Li', 'Wang, Rong', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Wu, Yu-Jie', 'Fan, Lei']","['Miao Y', 'Cao L', 'Sun Q', 'Li XT', 'Wang Y', 'Qiao C', 'Wang L', 'Wang R', 'Qiu HR', 'Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Wu YJ', 'Fan L']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170728,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Aged', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'flow cytometry', 'immunophenotyping', 'spectrum']",2017/07/29 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2461 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2018 Feb;36(1):121-127. doi: 10.1002/hon.2461.

We observed a significant reduction in surface expression of CD5 (sCD5) on leukaemic T cells compared to autologous non-leukaemic T cells. In this study, we have shown the molecular mechanism regulating the expression and function of CD5 on leukaemic T cells. A total of 250 patients suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma were immunophenotyped. Final diagnosis was based on their clinical presentation, morphological data and flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping. Thirty-nine patients were found to be of ALL-T origin. Amplification of early region of E1A and E1B transcripts of CD5 was correlated with the levels of surface and intracellular expression of CD5 protein. Functional studies were performed to show the effect of CD5 blocking on interleukin IL-2 production and survival of leukaemic and non-leukaemic cells. Lack of expression of sCD5 on T-ALL blasts was correlated closely with predominant transcription of exon E1B and significant loss of exon E1A of the CD5 gene, which is associated with surface expression of CD5 on lymphocytes. High expression of E1B also correlates with increased expression of cytoplasmic CD5 (cCD5) among leukaemic T cells. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in the production of IL-2 by non-leukaemic T cells upon CD5 blocking, leading possibly to their increased survival at 48 h. Our study provides understanding of the regulation of CD5 expression on leukaemic T cells, and may help in understanding the molecular mechanism of CD5 down-regulation.","['Rai, A K', 'Singh, A', 'Saxena, A', 'Seth, T', 'Raina, V', 'Mitra, D K']","['Rai AK', 'Singh A', 'Saxena A', 'Seth T', 'Raina V', 'Mitra DK']","['Cellular Immunology Division, Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, Allahabad, India.', 'Cellular Immunology Division, Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Cellular Immunology Division, Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, BRAIRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Cellular Immunology Division, Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170905,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', '*Blast Crisis/genetics/immunology/pathology', '*CD5 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation/*immunology', 'Exons/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/immunology', 'Male', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD5', '*T cell', '*acute leukaemia', '*down-regulation', '*immune suppression']",2017/07/29 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cei.13019 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2017 Dec;190(3):340-350. doi: 10.1111/cei.13019.

This fusion induces down-regulation of miR-155. Upregulation of miR-155 can influence cell fate via the effect on p27kip1 and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to induce apoptosis in K562 CML cell line by overexpression of miR-155. Methods: The K562 cell line was transfected with pLenti-III-pre mir155-GFP constructs through electroporation. Then, overexpression of miR-155 as well as the expression level of p27kip1 and c-Myc was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The level of p27 (Kip1) protein expression was measured by Western blot and the Annexin V method was carried out to investigate apoptosis. Results: Flow cytometric analysis results of K562 cells transfected with pLenti-III-pre mir155-GFP construct showed a significant increase in cell apoptosis. Gene expression and protein level of p27kip1 were upregulated. However, there was no change in c-Myc expression profile. Conclusion: miR-155 could be a promising approach to aid in the treatment of CML. However, further studies are required in this respect.","['Edalati Fathabad, Mahdi', 'Karimipoor, Morteza', 'Alizadeh, Shaban', 'Abdoli, Asghar', 'Atashi, Amir', 'Sayadi, Mahtab']","['Edalati Fathabad M', 'Karimipoor M', 'Alizadeh S', 'Abdoli A', 'Atashi A', 'Sayadi M']","['Hematology Department, School of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Department, Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, School of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hepatitis and AIDS, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Prevention Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.', 'Cancer Prevention Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170426,Iran,Bioimpacts,BioImpacts : BI,101558125,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'K562', 'Philadelphia', 'miR-155', 'p27kip1']",2017/07/29 06:00,2017/07/29 06:01,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15171/bi.2017.14 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioimpacts. 2017;7(2):109-114. doi: 10.15171/bi.2017.14.

This effect is based on the interaction of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) of donor NK cells with ligands of the major histocompatibility complex found on the surface of the target cells. HLA-C1 subtypes provide the ligand for KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 and the HLA-C2 subtypes for KIR2DL1. We have studied the probability of relapse (PR) after single-unit unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in relation to the potential graft-vs.-leukemia effect mediated by NK cells present in the umbilical cord blood (UCB) by analyzing KIR-ligand and HLA-C typing of the receptor. Data from 33 consecutive patients given a single unit UCBT were included. We have considered two groups of patients based on the absence or the presence of one of the C-ligands for inhibitory KIR and the incompatibility HLA-C1/2 between UCB and patients. Group 1 (n = 21): the patient lacks a C-ligand for inhibitory KIR present in UCB NK cells, i.e., patients homozygous C1/C1 or C2/C2. Group 2 (n = 12): patients heterozygous C1/C2 in which KIR-mediated graft-vs.-leukemia effect is not expected (presence of both C ligands for inhibitory KIR in the receptor). With a median follow-up post-UCBT of 93 months, patients with absence of a C-ligand for inhibitory KIRs (Group 1) showed a lower actuarial PR than patients with both C-ligands (group 2): 21 +/- 10 vs. 68 +/- 18% at 2 year and 36 +/- 13 vs. 84 +/- 14% at 5 years (p = 0.025), respectively. In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the 2-year PR was 36 +/- 21% for group 1 and 66 +/- 26% for 2 (p = 0.038). Furthermore, group 1 had a lower incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (p = 0.04). In the setting of UCBT, the absence of a C-ligand (C1 or C2) of inhibitory KIR in the patient is associated with lower PR, which is probably due to the graft-vs.-host leukemia effect caused by UCB NK cells that lack a ligand for the inhibitory KIR 2DL1/2DL2/2DL3.","['Martinez-Losada, Carmen', 'Martin, Carmen', 'Gonzalez, Rafael', 'Manzanares, Barbara', 'Garcia-Torres, Estefania', 'Herrera, Concha']","['Martinez-Losada C', 'Martin C', 'Gonzalez R', 'Manzanares B', 'Garcia-Torres E', 'Herrera C']","['Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia University Hospital/Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica (IMIBIC), University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia University Hospital/Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica (IMIBIC), University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Inmunology, Reina Sofia University Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Inmunology, Reina Sofia University Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia University Hospital/Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica (IMIBIC), University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia University Hospital/Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica (IMIBIC), University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170713,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['KIR', 'KIR-ligand', 'UCB-transplantion', 'leukemia', 'relapse']",2017/07/29 06:00,2017/07/29 06:01,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00810 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Jul 13;8:810. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00810. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5507950,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the therapeutic efficacies of DLI for other types of leukemia, including acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), have been limited thus far. Therefore, we examined whether increasing the reactivity of donor T cells by gene modification could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of DLI in a murine model of ALL. When a CTLA4-CD28 chimera gene (CTC28) in which the intracellular signaling domain of CTLA4 was replaced with the CD28 signaling domain was introduced into CD4 and CD8 T cells in DLI, the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect was significantly increased. This effect was correlated with an increased expansion of donor CD8 T cells in vivo, and the depletion of CD8 T cells abolished this effect. The CD8 T cell expansion and the enhanced GVT effect were dependent on the transduction of both CD4 and CD8 T cells with CTC28, which emphasizes the role of dual modification in this therapeutic effect. The CTC28-transduced T cells that expanded in vivo also exhibited enhanced functionality. Although the potentiation of the GVT effect mediated by the CTC28 gene modification of T cells was accompanied by an increase of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the GVHD was not lethal and was mitigated by treatment with IL-10 gene-modified third-party mesenchymal stem cells. Thus, the combined genetic modification of CD4 and CD8 donor T cells with CTC28 could be a promising strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of DLI.","['Park, Hyung Bae', 'Lee, Ji Eun', 'Oh, Yu Mi', 'Lee, Sang Jin', 'Eom, Hyeon-Seok', 'Choi, Kyungho']","['Park HB', 'Lee JE', 'Oh YM', 'Lee SJ', 'Eom HS', 'Choi K']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Hematologic Malignancy Branch, Research Institute National Cancer Center, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Hematologic Malignancy Branch, Research Institute National Cancer Center, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Hematologic Malignancy Branch, Research Institute National Cancer Center, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Genitourinary Cancer Branch, Research Institute National Cancer Center, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Hematologic Malignancy Branch, Research Institute National Cancer Center, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Center for Hematologic Malignancy, National Cancer Center, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170728,United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD28 Antigens/*genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/07/29 06:00,2018/04/14 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['emm2017104 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2017.104 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Mol Med. 2017 Jul 28;49(7):e360. doi: 10.1038/emm.2017.104.,,,,PMC5565951,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the impact of multiple RUNX1 mutations and RUNX1 wild-type (WT) loss in 467 AML with RUNX1 mutations (mut): (1) RUNX1 WT loss (n=53), (2) >1 RUNX1mut (n=94) and (3) 1 RUNX1mut (n=323). In 1 RUNX1mut, +8 was most frequent, whereas in WT loss +13 was the most abundant trisomy (+8: 66% vs 31%, P=0.022; +13: 15% vs 62%, P<0.001). Analyses of 28 genes in 163 selected cases revealed SRSF2 (39%), ASXL1 (36%), DNMT3A (19%), IDH2 (17%) and SF3B1 (17%) as most frequently mutated genes. RUNX1 WT loss showed a higher frequency of ASXL1mut compared with the other cases (50% vs 29%, P=0.009). Median overall survival (OS) in the total cohort was 14 months. WT loss (OS: 5 months) and >1 RUNX1mut (14 months) showed an adverse impact on prognosis compared with 1 RUNX1mut (22 months; P=0.002 and 0.048, respectively). Mutations in ASXL1 and 2 additional mutations correlated with shorter OS (10 vs 18 months, P=0.028; 12 vs 20 months, P=0.017). Thus, the number of RUNX1mut, RUNX1 WT loss and the number and type of additional mutations is biologically and clinically relevant.","['Stengel, A', 'Kern, W', 'Meggendorfer, M', 'Nadarajah, N', 'Perglerova, K', 'Haferlach, T', 'Haferlach, C']","['Stengel A', 'Kern W', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Nadarajah N', 'Perglerova K', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL2, Praha, Czech Republic.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170728,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/07/29 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017239 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.239 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Feb;32(2):295-302. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.239.

Targeting the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins is an attractive option to combat chemoresistance in leukemia. Preclinical and clinical studies indicate modest single-agent activity with selective BCL-2 inhibitors (for example, venetoclax). We show that venetoclax synergizes with cytarabine and idarubicin to increase antileukemic efficacy in a TP53-dependent manner. Although TP53 deficiency impaired sensitivity to combined venetoclax and chemotherapy, higher-dose idarubicin was able to suppress MCL1 and induce cell death independently of TP53. Consistent with an MCL1-specific effect, cell death from high-dose idarubicin was dependent on pro-apoptotic Bak. Combining higher-dose idarubicin with venetoclax was able to partially overcome resistance in Bak-deficient cells. Using inducible vectors and venetoclax to differentially target anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, BCL-2 and MCL1 emerged as critical and complementary proteins regulating cell survival in acute myeloid leukemia. Dual targeting of BCL-2 and MCL1, but not either alone, prolonged survival of leukemia-bearing mice. In conclusion, our findings support the further investigation of venetoclax in combination with standard chemotherapy, including intensified doses of idarubicin. Venetoclax should also be investigated in combination with direct inhibitors of MCL1 as a chemotherapy-free approach in the future.","['Teh, T-C', 'Nguyen, N-Y', 'Moujalled, D M', 'Segal, D', 'Pomilio, G', 'Rijal, S', 'Jabbour, A', 'Cummins, K', 'Lackovic, K', 'Blombery, P', 'Thompson, E', 'Ekert, P G', 'Lessene, G', 'Glaser, S P', 'Huang, D C S', 'Roberts, A W', 'Guthridge, M A', 'Wei, A H']","['Teh TC', 'Nguyen NY', 'Moujalled DM', 'Segal D', 'Pomilio G', 'Rijal S', 'Jabbour A', 'Cummins K', 'Lackovic K', 'Blombery P', 'Thompson E', 'Ekert PG', 'Lessene G', 'Glaser SP', 'Huang DCS', 'Roberts AW', 'Guthridge MA', 'Wei AH']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Departments of Medicine and Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria.

Two recurrent cytogenetic aberrations, namely del(17p), affecting TP53, and del(11q), affecting ATM, are associated with resistance against genotoxic chemotherapy (del17p) and poor outcome (del11q and del17p). Both del(17p) and del(11q) are also associated with inferior outcome to the novel targeted agents, such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Thus, even in the era of targeted therapies, CLL with alterations in the ATM/p53 pathway remains a clinical challenge. Here we generated two mouse models of Atm- and Trp53-deficient CLL. These animals display a significantly earlier disease onset and reduced overall survival, compared to controls. We employed these models in conjunction with transcriptome analyses following cyclophosphamide treatment to reveal that Atm deficiency is associated with an exquisite and genotype-specific sensitivity against PARP inhibition. Thus, we generate two aggressive CLL models and provide a preclinical rational for the use of PARP inhibitors in ATM-affected human CLL.ATM and TP53 mutations are associated with poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Here the authors generate mouse models of Tp53- and Atm-defective CLL mimicking the high-risk form of human disease and show that Atm-deficient CLL is sensitive to PARP1 inhibition.","['Knittel,

The value of asparaginase was further addressed in a group of non-very high-risk patients by comparing prolonged (long-asparaginase) versus standard (short-asparaginase) native E. coli asparaginase treatment in a randomized part of the phase III 58951 trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children's Leukemia Group. The main endpoint was disease-free survival. Overall, 1,552 patients were randomly assigned to long-asparaginase (775 patients) or short-asparaginase (777 patients). Patients with grade >/=2 allergy to native E. coli asparaginase were switched to equivalent doses of Erwinia or pegylated E. coli asparaginase. The 8-year disease-free survival rate (+/-standard error) was 87.0+/-1.3% in the long-asparaginase group and 84.4+/-1.4% in the short-asparaginase group (hazard ratio: 0.87; P=0.33) and the 8-year overall survival rate was 92.6+/-1.0% and 91.3+/-1.2% respectively (hazard ratio: 0.89; P=0.53). An exploratory analysis suggested that the impact of long-asparaginase was beneficial in the National Cancer Institute standard-risk group with regards to disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.70; P=0.057), but far less so with regards to overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.89). The incidences of grade 3-4 infection during consolidation (25.2% versus 14.4%) and late intensification (22.6% versus 15.9%) and the incidence of grade 2-4 allergy were higher in the long-asparaginase arm (30% versus 21%). Prolonged native E. coli asparaginase therapy in consolidation and late intensification for our non-very high-risk patients did not improve overall outcome but led to an increase in infections and allergy.

Its precise relationship to other related splenic B-cell lymphomas with frequent leukemic involvement or other lymphoproliferative disorders remains undetermined. We performed whole-exome sequencing to explore the genetic landscape of ten cases of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma using paired tumor and normal samples. A selection of 109 somatic mutations was then evaluated in a cohort including 42 samples of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma and compared to those identified in 46 samples of splenic marginal zone lymphoma and eight samples of hairy-cell leukemia. Recurrent mutations or losses in BCOR (the gene encoding the BCL6 corepressor) - frameshift (n=3), nonsense (n=2), splicing site (n=1), and copy number loss (n=4) - were identified in 10/42 samples of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (24%), whereas only one frameshift mutation was identified in 46 cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (2%). Inversely, KLF2, TNFAIP3 and MYD88, common mutations in splenic marginal zone lymphoma, were rare (one KLF2 mutant in 42 samples; 2%) or absent (TNFAIP3 and MYD88) in splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma. These findings define an original genetic profile of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma and suggest that the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this lymphoma are distinct from those of splenic marginal zone lymphoma and hairy-cell leukemia.","['Jallades, Laurent', 'Baseggio, Lucile', 'Sujobert, Pierre', 'Huet, Sarah', 'Chabane, Kaddour', 'Callet-Bauchu, Evelyne', 'Verney, Aurelie', 'Hayette, Sandrine',

Different types of intragenic deletions have been observed, resulting in a functionally inactivated allele (""loss-of-function"") or in ""dominant-negative"" isoforms. The prognostic impact of these alterations especially in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia is not well defined. We analyzed 482 well-characterized cases of adult BCR-ABL-negative B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia uniformly treated in the framework of the GMALL studies and detected IKZF1 alterations in 128 cases (27%). In 20%, the IKZF1 alteration was present in a large fraction of leukemic cells (""high deletion load"") while in 7% it was detected only in small subclones (""low deletion load""). Some patients showed more than one IKZF1 alteration (8%). Patients exhibiting a loss-of-function isoform with high deletion load had a shorter overall survival (OS at 5 years 28% vs. 59%; P<0.0001), also significant in a subgroup analysis of standard risk patients according to GMALL classification (OS at 5 years 37% vs. 68%; P=0.0002). Low deletion load or dominant-negative IKZF1 alterations had no prognostic impact.

We pooled data from 1505 chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma patients enrolled in four large, randomized, controlled studies to characterize AF with ibrutinib and its management. AF incidence was 6.5% [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 4.8, 8.5] for ibrutinib at 16.6-months versus 1.6% (95%CI: 0.8, 2.8) for comparator and 10.4% (95%CI: 8.4, 12.9) at the 36-month follow up; estimated cumulative incidence: 13.8% (95%CI: 11.2, 16.8). Ibrutinib treatment, prior history of AF and age 65 years or over were independent risk factors for AF. Multiple AF events were more common with ibrutinib (44.9%; comparator, 16.7%) among patients with AF. Most (85.7%) patients with AF did not discontinue ibrutinib, and more than half received common anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications on study. Low-grade bleeds were more frequent with ibrutinib, but serious bleeds were uncommon (ibrutinib, 2.9%; comparator, 2.0%). Although the AF rate among older non-trial patients with comorbidities is likely underestimated by this dataset, these results suggest that AF among clinical trial patients is generally manageable without ibrutinib discontinuation (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 01578707, 01722487, 01611090, 01646021).","['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Moslehi, Javid', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Fraser, Graeme', 'Rule, Simon', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Coutre, Steven', 'Dilhuydy, Marie-Sarah', 'Cramer, Paula', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Dreyling, Martin', 'Byrd, John C', 'Howes, Angela', 'Todd, Michael', 'Vermeulen, Jessica', 'James, Danelle F', 'Clow, Fong', 'Styles, Lori', 'Valentino, Rudy', 'Wildgust, Mark', 'Mahler, Michelle', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Brown JR', 'Moslehi J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ghia P', 'Hillmen P', 'Cymbalista F', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Fraser G', 'Rule S', 'Kipps TJ', 'Coutre S', 'Dilhuydy MS', 'Cramer P', 'Tedeschi A', 'Jaeger U', 'Dreyling M', 'Byrd JC', 'Howes A', 'Todd M', 'Vermeulen J', 'James DF', 'Clow F', 'Styles L', 'Valentino R', 'Wildgust M', 'Mahler M', 'Burger JA']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA jbrown2@partners.org.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine and Cardio-Oncology Program Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, Orange, CA, USA.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'CA Leeds Teaching Hospitals, St. James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK.', 'Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP, UMR Paris13/INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Juravinski Cancer Centre, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Haematology, Plymouth University Medical School, Plymouth, UK.', 'Moores UCSD Cancer Center, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine and Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Hopital Haut-Leveque, Bordeaux, Pessac, France.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and German CLL Study Group, University of Cologne, Germany.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera Niguarda Ca Granda, Milano, Italy.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Germany.', 'Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, High Wycombe, UK.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Pharmacyclics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA.', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170727,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Atrial Fibrillation/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,,2017/07/29 06:00,2018/05/22 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.171041 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.171041 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Oct;102(10):1796-1805. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.171041.

Over the past several decades, we have learned a tremendous amount regarding the genetic aberrations that govern disease development in AML. Among these are genes that encode noncoding RNAs, including the microRNA (miRNA) family. miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs that display important physiological effects through their posttranscriptional regulation of messenger RNA targets. Over the past decade, studies have identified miRNAs as playing a role in nearly all aspects of AML disease development, including cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation. These observations have led to the study of miRNAs as biomarkers of disease, and efforts to therapeutically manipulate miRNAs to improve disease outcome in AML are ongoing. Although much has been learned regarding the importance of miRNAs in AML disease initiation and progression, there are many unanswered questions and emerging facets of miRNA biology that add complexity to their roles in AML. Moving forward, answers to these questions will provide a greater level of understanding of miRNA biology and critical insights into the many translational applications for these small regulatory RNAs in AML.","['Wallace, Jared A', ""O'Connell, Ryan M""]","['Wallace JA', ""O'Connell RM""]","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170727,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', '*Translational Research, Biomedical']",,,2017/07/29 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32869-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-10-697698 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Sep 14;130(11):1290-1301. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-10-697698.

We identified Mcl-1 as a direct Cdk5 substrate using an innovative chemical screen in mouse brain lysates. Our data demonstrate that Mcl-1 levels determine the threshold for cellular damage in response to neurotoxic insults. Mcl-1 is a disease-specific target of Cdk5, which associates with Cdk5 under basal conditions, but is not regulated by it. Neurotoxic insults hyperactivate Cdk5 causing Mcl-1 phosphorylation at T92. This phosphorylation event triggers Mcl-1 ubiquitylation, which directly correlates with mitochondrial dysfunction. Consequently, ectopic expression of phosphorylation-dead T92A-Mcl-1 fully prevents mitochondrial damage and subsequent cell death triggered by neurotoxic treatments in neuronal cells and primary cortical neurons. Notably, enhancing Mcl-1 levels offers comparable neuroprotection to that observed upon Cdk5 depletion, suggesting that Mcl-1 degradation by direct phosphorylation is a key mechanism by which Cdk5 promotes neurotoxicity in AD. The clinical significance of the Mcl-1-Cdk5 axis was investigated in human AD clinical specimens, revealing an inverse correlation between Mcl-1 levels and disease severity. These results emphasize the potential of Mcl-1 upregulation as an attractive therapeutic strategy for delaying or preventing neurodegeneration in AD.","['Nikhil, Kumar', 'Shah, Kavita']","['Nikhil K', 'Shah K']","['Department of Chemistry and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, 560 Oval Drive, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, 560 Oval Drive, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA shah23@purdue.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170727,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5)']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5/*metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nerve Degeneration/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurotoxins/toxicity', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Cdk5', 'Chemical genetic', 'Mcl-1', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Neuroprotection']",2017/07/29 06:00,2018/06/06 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.205666 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.205666 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2017 Sep 15;130(18):3023-3039. doi: 10.1242/jcs.205666.

Although multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified variants predisposing children to ALL, it remains unclear whether genetic heterogeneity affects ALL susceptibility and how interactions within and among genes containing ALL-associated variants influence ALL risk.Methods: Here, we jointly analyzed two published datasets of case-control GWA summary statistics along with germline data from ALL case-parent trios. We used the gene-level association method PEGASUS to identify genes with multiple variants associated with ALL. We then used PEGASUS gene scores as input to the network analysis algorithm HotNet2 to characterize the genomic architecture of ALL.Results: Using PEGASUS, we confirmed associations previously observed at genes such as ARID5B, IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B, and PIP4K2A, and we identified novel candidate gene associations. Using HotNet2, we uncovered significant gene subnetworks that may underlie inherited ALL risk: a subnetwork involved in B-cell differentiation containing the ALL-associated gene CEBPE, and a subnetwork of homeobox genes, including MEIS1Conclusions: Gene and network analysis uncovered loci associated with ALL that are missed by GWA studies, such as MEIS1 Furthermore, ALL-associated loci do not appear to interact directly with each other to influence ALL risk, and instead appear to influence leukemogenesis through multiple, complex pathways.Impact: We present a new pipeline for post hoc analysis of association studies that yields new insight into the etiology of ALL and can be applied in future studies to shed light on the genomic underpinnings of cancer.

Clinical and haemodynamic variables were compared from baseline to last follow-up (median (range) 24 (1-81) months).Median age was 52 years and 15 patients were female (71%). 19 patients received dasatinib for chronic myelogenous leukaemia for a median (range) duration of 42 (8-74) months before PAH diagnosis. No bone morphogenic protein receptor-2 (BMPR2) mutations were found in the 10 patients tested. Dasatinib was uniformly discontinued and 11 patients received PAH medications. Four patients died during follow-up. New York Heart Association functional class improved from 76% in class III/IV to 90% in class I/II (p<0.01). Median (range) 6-min walk distance improved from 306 (0-660) to 430 (165-635) m (p<0.01). Median (range) mean pulmonary arterial pressure improved from 45 (30-70) to 26 (17-50) mmHg (p<0.01) and pulmonary vascular resistance from 6.1 (3.2-27.3) to 2.6 (1.2-5.9) Wood units (p<0.01). Patients treated with PAH medications had worse baseline haemodynamics but similar long-term outcomes to untreated patients. PAH persisted in 37% of patients.Dasatinib-induced PAH frequently improves after discontinuation but persisted in over one-third of patients, therefore systematic follow-up is essential.","['Weatherald, Jason', 'Chaumais, Marie-Camille', 'Savale, Laurent', 'Jais, Xavier', 'Seferian, Andrei', 'Canuet, Matthieu', 'Bouvaist, Helene', 'Magro, Pascal', 'Bergeron, Anne', 'Guignabert, Christophe', 'Sitbon, Olivier', 'Simonneau, Gerald', 'Humbert, Marc', 'Montani, David']","['Weatherald J', 'Chaumais MC', 'Savale L', 'Jais X', 'Seferian A', 'Canuet M', 'Bouvaist H', 'Magro P', 'Bergeron A', 'Guignabert C', 'Sitbon O', 'Simonneau G', 'Humbert M', 'Montani D']","['Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Division of Respirology, Dept of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris-Saclay, Chatenay Malabry, France.', 'Service de Pharmacie, DHU-TORINO, Hopital Antoine Beclere, Clamart, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Nouvel Hopital Civil, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Service de Cardiologie, CHU Genoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, CHRU de Tours, Tours, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Service de Pneumologie, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 1153 CRESS, Biostatistics and Clinical Epidemiology Research Team, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France david.montani@aphp.fr.', 'Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Bicetre, AP-HP, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMR_S 999, Hopital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170727,England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*chemically induced', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vascular Resistance', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/07/29 06:00,2018/05/16 06:00,['2017/07/29 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['50/1/1700217 [pii]', '10.1183/13993003.00217-2017 [doi]']",epublish,Eur Respir J. 2017 Jul 27;50(1). pii: 50/1/1700217. doi: 10.1183/13993003.00217-2017.

Septin 6 is known as a fusion partner of mixed-lineage leukemia in infant acute myeloid leukemia. The occurrence of the fusion gene is associated with a reduced expression of septin 6 itself. The role of septin 6 in hematopoiesis and whether it is involved in scaffolds within hematopoietic cells is not known. Septin 6-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) present with an increased engraftment potential but altered lymphoid differentiation with a reduced contribution to the T-cell compartment and an increased B-cell contribution. Although multipotent progenitor cells showed a very distinct septin 6 filament organization and intracellular distribution, their function was not impaired by septin 6 deficiency. Our data therefore suggest a regulatory role for septin 6 in long-term HSC function and lymphoid lineage differentiation.","['Senger, Katharina', 'Marka, Gina', 'Soller, Karin', 'Sakk, Vadim', 'Florian, Maria Carolina', 'Geiger, Hartmut']","['Senger K', 'Marka G', 'Soller K', 'Sakk V', 'Florian MC', 'Geiger H']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', ""Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany; Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH.

The efficacy of mAb therapy can be improved when they are conjugated to a highly potent payloads, including cytotoxic drugs and radiolabeled isotopes. The Eph family of proteins has received considerable attention in recent years as therapeutic targets for treatment of both solid and hematological cancers. High expression of Eph receptors on cancer cells compared with low expression levels in normal adult tissues makes them an attractive candidate for cancer immunotherapy.

Once thought of as a death sentence, HIV infection has become a chronically manageable disease. However, it is estimated that a staggering 0.8% of the world's population is infected with HIV, with more than 1 million deaths reported in 2015 alone. Despite the development of effective anti-retroviral drugs, a permanent cure has only been documented in one patient to date. In 2007, an HIV-positive patient received a bone marrow transplant to treat his leukemia from an individual who was homozygous for a mutation in the CCR5 gene. This mutation, known as CCR5Delta32, prevents HIV replication by inhibiting the early stage of viral entry into cells, resulting in resistance to infection from the majority of HIV isolates. More than 10 years after his last dose of anti-retroviral therapy, the transplant recipient remains free of replication-competent virus. Multiple groups are now attempting to replicate this success through the use of other CCR5-negative donor cell sources. Additionally, developments in the use of lentiviral vectors and targeted nucleases have opened the doors of precision medicine and enabled new treatment methodologies to combat HIV infection through targeted ablation or down-regulation of CCR5 expression. Here, we review historical cases of CCR5-edited cell-based therapies, current clinical trials and future benefits and challenges associated with this technology.","['Haworth, Kevin G', 'Peterson, Christopher W', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter']","['Haworth KG', 'Peterson CW', 'Kiem HP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Malignant cells are capable of escaping host immune surveillance by inactivating cytotoxic lymphoid cells. In this work we discovered a fundamental molecular pathway, which includes ligand-dependent activation of ectopically expressed latrophilin 1 and possibly other G-protein coupled receptors leading to increased translation and exocytosis of the immune receptor Tim-3 and its ligand galectin-9. This occurs in a protein kinase C and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-dependent manner. Tim-3 participates in galectin-9 secretion and is also released in a free soluble form. Galectin-9 impairs the anti-cancer activity of cytotoxic lymphoid cells including natural killer (NK) cells. Soluble Tim-3 prevents secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) required for the activation of cytotoxic lymphoid cells. These results were validated in ex vivo experiments using primary samples from AML patients. This pathway provides reliable targets for both highly specific diagnosis and immune therapy of AML.","['Goncalves Silva, Isabel', 'Yasinska, Inna M', 'Sakhnevych, Svetlana S', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Bardelli, Marco', 'Varani, Luca', 'Hussain, Rohanah', 'Siligardi, Giuliano', 'Ceccone, Giacomo', 'Berger, Steffen M', 'Ushkaryov, Yuri A', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Fasler-Kan, Elizaveta', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Goncalves Silva I', 'Yasinska IM', 'Sakhnevych SS', 'Fiedler W', 'Wellbrock J', 'Bardelli M', 'Varani L', 'Hussain R', 'Siligardi G', 'Ceccone G', 'Berger SM', 'Ushkaryov YA', 'Gibbs BF', 'Fasler-Kan E', 'Sumbayev VV']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham Maritime, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham Maritime, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham Maritime, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.', ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", 'Beamline 23, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK.', 'Beamline 23, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK.', 'European Commission Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery and Department of Clinical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Switzerland."", 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham Maritime, UK.

Overall, multivariate analysis showed significant intergroup differences in terms of relapse and survival, with the difference between poor- and intermediate-risk groups being greater than that between favorable- and intermediate-risk groups. Non-relapse mortality was identical for the three groups. Significant effects of cytogenetic risk status on survival were documented irrespective of donor type (related, unrelated, and umbilical cord blood), disease status at the time of transplantation (first or second complete remission, and more advanced disease status), and conditioning intensity (myeloablative and reduced-intensity).

In the present study, we used N, N, N', N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylene-diamine (TPEN), a membrane-permeable zinc chelator, to evaluate the effect of zinc depletion on survival and apoptosis of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. METHODS: The pro-apoptotic effects of TPEN on NB4 cells were examined by flow cytometry, and observed using an optical microscope. Intracellular labile zinc, nitric oxide (NO) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) changes caused by TPEN were measured by flow cytometry. We then explored possible roles of the crosstalk between intracellular labile zinc signaling and nitric oxide signaling in TPEN-triggered apoptosis. RESULTS: we found that TPEN induced apoptosis in NB4 APL cells in a dosage-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that TPEN triggered apoptosis by attenuating intracellular zinc and nitric oxide signaling in NB4 cells. Both exogenous zinc supplement and the nitric donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) pre-incubation reversed TPEN-mediated inhibition of intracellular NO and Zn2+ signaling, and rescued NB4 cells from apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest for the first time that crosstalk between zinc signaling and nitric oxide pathway is essential for the survival of NB4 cells. TPEN induces apoptosis in NB4 cells via negatively regulating intracellular NO and Zn2+ signaling. Our in vitro data suggest that zinc depletion by TPEN may be a potential therapeutic strategy for APL.","['Zhu, Bo', 'Wang, Jiayu', 'Zhou, Feng', 'Liu, Yingting', 'Lai, Yueyang', 'Wang, Jie', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Chen, Dianhua', 'Luo, Lan', 'Hua, Zi-Chun']","['Zhu B', 'Wang J', 'Zhou F', 'Liu Y', 'Lai Y', 'Wang J', 'Chen X', 'Chen D', 'Luo L', 'Hua ZC']","['The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Changzhou High-Tech Research Institute of Nanjing University and Jiangsu Target Pharma Laboratories Inc., Changzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170727,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ethylenediamines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', ""R9PTU1U29I (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine)""]",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Caspases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chelating Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ethylenediamines/chemistry/*toxicity', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Zinc/*chemistry/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Nitric oxide', 'TPEN', 'Zinc']",2017/07/28 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['000479539 [pii]', '10.1159/000479539 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;42(5):1822-1836. doi: 10.1159/000479539.

Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) combinations have become the standard of care for most patients, and novel targeted agents are rapidly being incorporated into the front-line and relapsed settings. Minimal residual disease status has been shown to be a predictor of both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at the time of response assessment following CIT, but less is known about the relationship between MRD and outcomes after novel oral therapeutics. Herein, we review current methods for MRD testing and present relevant clinical data for MRD for current treatment regimens focusing on novel oral agents as monotherapies and in combination. Observations: Flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction are the 2 methods most frequently used to measure MRD, although high-throughput sequencing and more specific assays are being refined. Minimal residual disease status is an independent predictor of PFS and OS for patients receiving CIT, and emerging data for venetoclax suggest a relationship between MRD negativity and outcomes. The prognostic value of MRD status for kinase inhibitors remains unknown. Conclusions and Relevance: Minimal residual disease as a clinical trial end point must be validated in prospective studies prior to being used as a surrogate for survival. Given the heterogeneity of CLL biology and therapies, this validation must be regimen specific. Minimal residual disease assessments should be performed in clinical trial patients with both partial and complete responses. Following CIT, MRD status has prognostic value in all responders and this observation is important to validate with novel agents because most patients obtain partial remission. Further research is required to validate the use of MRD status as a decision point in guiding therapy in clinical practice.","['Thompson, Meghan', 'Brander, Danielle', 'Nabhan, Chadi', 'Mato, Anthony']","['Thompson M', 'Brander D', 'Nabhan C', 'Mato A']","['Center for CLL, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio.', 'Center for CLL, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/therapeutic use', 'Drugs, Investigational/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/07/28 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['2645852 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.2009 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2018 Mar 1;4(3):394-400. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.2009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study explored understanding and challenges of Malaysian CML patients in taking imatinib and nilotinib. Methods: Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 13 CML patients receiving treatment at a public tertiary care center, and were analyzed using the content analysis approach. Results: The patients generally demonstrated inadequate knowledge, particularly of the natural history and staging of CML, the function of TKIs, and the methods used for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. A number of them also had experiences of withholding, skipping or altering the treatment, mainly due to the life-disturbing adverse drug effects (ADRs), forgetfulness, and religious and social issues. Besides, most of them were found having limited skills in managing the ADRs, and not using prompts as reminders to take the medications. Furthermore, even though nilotinib was generally perceived as better tolerated as compared with imatinib, the inconvenience caused by the need to take it twice daily and on an empty stomach was constantly highlighted by the patients. Conclusion: While TKIs are widely used for CML treatment in Malaysia, the findings have revealed a lack of patient education and awareness, which warrants an integrated plan to reinforce medication adherence.","['Lim, Yik Ming', 'Eng, Wei Lerk', 'Chan, Huan Keat']","['Lim YM', 'Eng WL', 'Chan HK']","['Pharmacy Department, Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital, Alor Setar, Malaysia.

These included mice who were given melatonin 14 days prior to their successful mating (confirmed by vaginal plug) (Group A), after successful mating (Group B), and 14 days prior to and until after successful mating (Group C). Melatonin administration significantly enhanced serum as well as ovarian melatonin levels in the mice. It was observed that melatonin did not affect the natural estrous of mice. On day 0.5 of gestation (D0.5), melatonin not only elevated progesterone (P) secretion, but also upregulated expressions of StAR and Cyp11a1, the two marker genes of corpus luteum in ovaries (p < 0.05). Group A had a significantly lower estradiol (E(2)) secretion and a higher number of implantation sites as well as litter size than controls (p < 0.05) and also had an increased Ihh expression in endometrium of D7.5 gestation. Melatonin treatment after successful mating improved the progesterone (P) secretion at D7.5 of gestation (p < 0.05) and significantly induced leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression (p < 0.05). Our study indicates that melatonin treatment up-regulated the genes involved in pregnenolone synthesis in ovary and Ihh expression in uterine endometrium. The mechanisms of melatonin to improve embryo implantation related to their actions on promoting the development of corpus luteum before gestation and helping to specify uterine receptivity in early pregnant mice.","['Guan, Shengyu', 'Xie, Lu', 'Ma, Teng', 'Lv, Dongying', 'Jing, Wang', 'Tian, Xiuzhi', 'Song, Yukun', 'Liu, Zhiping', 'Xiao, Xianghong', 'Liu, Guoshi']","['Guan S', 'Xie L', 'Ma T', 'Lv D', 'Jing W', 'Tian X', 'Song Y', 'Liu Z', 'Xiao X', 'Liu G']","['College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, No. 26, Hexing Road, Xiangfang District, Harbin 150036, China. gsy729@hotmail.com.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. gsy729@hotmail.com.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. luxiecau@163.com.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. mateng7777@126.com.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. suxingdemogu@icloud.com.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. caylajing@cau.edu.cn.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. tian7550@163.com.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. songyukun@cau.edu.cn.', 'College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, No. 26, Hexing Road, Xiangfang District, Harbin 150036, China. liuzhp2000@163.com.', 'College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, No. 26, Hexing Road, Xiangfang District, Harbin 150036, China. hzy0106@gmail.com.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding of the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Genetic Improvement, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China. gshliu@cau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170727,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (ihh protein, mouse)', '0 (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 1.14.15.6 (Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme/*metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Endometrium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Estrous Cycle/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Litter Size', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Ovary/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/blood', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['E2', 'P', 'corpus luteum', 'early pregnancy', 'melatonin', 'mice']",2017/07/28 06:00,2018/04/17 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18081637 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18081637 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Jul 27;18(8). pii: ijms18081637. doi: 10.3390/ijms18081637.,,,,PMC5578027,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated HbF levels in JMML are associated with DNA hypermethylation of distinct gene promoter regions in leukemic cells. Since the regulation of globin gene transcription is known to be under epigenetic control, we set out to study the relation of DNA methylation patterns at beta-/gamma-globin promoters, mRNA and protein expression of globins, and epigenetic modifications of genes encoding the globin-regulatory transcription factors BCL11A and KLF1 in nucleated erythropoietic precursor cells of patients with JMML. We describe several altered epigenetic components resulting in disordered globin synthesis in JMML. We identify a cis-regulatory upstream KLF1 enhancer sequence as highly sensitive to DNA methylation and frequently hypermethylated in JMML. The data indicate that the dysregulation of beta-like globin genes is a genuine attribute of the leukemic cell clone in JMML and involves mechanisms not taking part in the normal fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch.","['Fluhr, Silvia', 'Krombholz, Christopher Felix', 'Meier, Angelina', 'Epting, Thomas', 'Mucke, Oliver', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Flotho, Christian']","['Fluhr S', 'Krombholz CF', 'Meier A', 'Epting T', 'Mucke O', 'Plass C', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Flotho C']","['a Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'b Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'c Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'c Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'd Multicenter Consortium, The German Cancer Consortium , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'd Multicenter Consortium, The German Cancer Consortium , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany.', 'd Multicenter Consortium, The German Cancer Consortium , Heidelberg , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170727,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics', 'beta-Globins/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetic regulation', '*KLF1', '*fetal hemoglobin', '*juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia']",2017/07/28 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15592294.2017.1356959 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2017 Aug;12(8):715-723. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2017.1356959.

The aim of our study was to assess the characteristics and outcomes of such patients and to identify factors predicting ICU mortality. Material and Methods: This retrospective chart review was conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre over a period of 5 years, from January 2010 to January 2015. Results: Characteristics :A total of 213 patients were included in this study. There were 150 (70.4%) males and 63 (29.6%) females with the median age of 36 years (18-88 years). Main diagnosis was non- Hodgkin lymphoma in 127 (59.6%) followed by Hodgkin's disease in 27 (12.7%) and acute myeloid leukemia in 16 (7.5%). Most of the patients 154 (72.3%) were on active chemotherapy at the time of admission to ICU, while 28 patients (13.1%) had newly diagnosed disease and 22 (10.3%) featured either relapsed or progressive disease. The most common reason for admission to ICU was a combination of respiratory failure with septic shock (29.6%) followed by septic shock alone (19.7%) and acute respiratory failure (13.1%). Other causes included acute renal failure, alone (7.5%) or in combination with respiratory or circulatory collapse (10.8%) and central nervous system involvement (5.6%). The majority of admissions to ICU occurred between days one and five of admission to a ward (46.5%, n=99) whereas 49 (23%) were taken directly to the ICU. Mainstay of treatment in 38.5% of patients included both invasive ventilation and vasopressor support along with other supportive care like fluids and antibiotics. 23.5% received only supportive management. Duration of stay for 150 (70.4%) patients was between one to seven days. Outcomes: A total of 119 (55.9 %) patients expired while in ICU, while 14 (6.6%) died in hospital after being transferred out of ICU. ICU survival was 44.1% whereas hospital survival was 37.5%. After discharge from hospital in a stable condition, 18 (8.5%) patients were lost to follow up and 62 (29%) patients were alive after thirty days. A total of 33 (15.4 %) of patients survived for at least one year after ICU admission. Some 21 (9.8%) are still alive and healthy after a minimum median follow up of one and a half years. Predictors of Mortality: Overall, mechanical ventilation was required in 61% of patients. Out of the patients who expired, 92.4% required intubation, in contrast to 21.3% for those who survived the ICU stay. Involvement of three or more organs was apparent in 12.8% of improved patients and 70.6% of those who died during ICU stay. Neutropenia did not appear to be a major discriminatory factor, with 33% of improved and 42.9% of expired patients being neutropenic at the time of admission to ICU. The majority of patients from both the improved and expired group required intubation and vasopressors from day one onwards. Conclusions: Admission of patients with hematological malignancies to the intensive care unit is associated with poor outcome and high mortality. Identifying the patients who can benefit from aggressive care and prolonged ICU support is important especially when it comes to countries like ours with limited resources and major financial restraints. Multi-organ damage and requirement of invasive ventilation are two main predictors of increased mortality. Neutropenia is also associated with adverse outcome; however, the difference is not as significant as for the other two factors.","['Maqsood, Shafaq', 'Badar, Farhana', 'Hameed, Abdul']","['Maqsood S', 'Badar F', 'Hameed A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan.

Plant leaves were extracted sequentially with a soxhlet apparatus, using petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol solvents. Petroleum ether and chloroform extracts exhibited antiproliferative properties against Caco-2, HeLa, THP-1, MCF-7 and Jurkat E6-1cancer cell lines tested, but methanol extracts failed to exhibit such activity. The major antiproliferative principle from petroleum ether and chloroform extracts was isolated with the help of bioassay guided column chromatography. This cytotoxic compound was further analysed by UV, TLC, HPLC, LC-MS, GC-MS and NMR analyses and was identified to be novel: (Z)-ethylidene-4,6-dimethoxycoumaran-3-one (Compound 1). The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations for proliferation (IC50) exhibited by compound 1 were 19.4, 23.1, 22.1, 35.9 and 8.32 muM against Caco-2, HeLa, THP-1, MCF-7 and Jurkat E6-1 cancer cell lines, respectively. Further experiments revealed that compound 1 triggered the apoptosis mode of cell death in cancer cell lines. Thus, the present study allowed isolation and identification of a novel cytotoxic natural compound, (Z)-ethylidene-4,6-dimethoxycoumaran-3-one, from plant leaves of P. quadrifolius (Benth.). Our pre-clinical study also indicated that compound 1 is particularly active in the acute T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat E6-1) with potential for application as a chemotherapeutic agent in the future.","['Cheriyamundath, Sanith', 'Raghavan, Rahul', 'Banerji, Asoke', 'Klika, Karel D', 'Ulrich, Cornelia', 'Owen, Robert W', 'Madassery, Joseph']","['Cheriyamundath S', 'Raghavan R', 'Banerji A', 'Klika KD', 'Ulrich C', 'Owen RW', 'Madassery J']","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Calicut, Malappuram, Kerala, India.

Public health care systems' budgets are already strained by growing and aging populations, and many private insurer's budgets are equally stretched. The current systems that most payers employ to manage their cash flow are not structured to absorb a sudden onslaught of very expensive prescriptions for a large portion of their covered population. Despite this, developers of new regenerative medicines tend to focus on the demands of regulators, not payers, in order to be compliant throughout the clinical trials phases, and to develop a product that ultimately will be approvable. It is not advisable to assume that an approved product will automatically become a reimbursed product, as examples from current practice in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the U.S. demonstrate; similarly, in Europe numerous Advanced-therapy Medicinal Products achieved market authorization but failed to secure reimbursement (e.g., Glybera, Provenge, ChondroCelect, MACI). There are however strategies and approaches that developers can employ throughout clinical development, in order to generate clinical and health economic data which will be necessary to demonstrate the value proposition of the new product and help ensure market access for patients; furthermore, performance based managed entry agreements coupled with post-launch evidence generation can help overcome challenges around product uncertainty at launch and reduce market access delays.

Thanks to risk-adapted combination chemotherapy treatments currently used, survival at 5 years has reached 90%. ALL is a heterogeneous disease from a genetic point of view: patients' lymphoblasts may harbor in fact several chromosomal alterations, some of which have prognostic and therapeutic value. Of particular importance is the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) that leads to the formation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, encoding a constitutively active chimeric tyrosine kinase (TK): BCR-ABL1 that is present in ~3% of pediatric ALL patients with B-immunophenotype and is associated with a poor outcome. This type of ALL is potentially treatable with specific TK inhibitors, such as imatinib. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a subset of BCR-ABL1 like leukemias (~10-15% of Bimmunophenotype ALL), whose blast cells have a gene expression profile similar to that of BCR-ABL1 despite the absence of t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). The precise pathogenesis of BCR-ABL1 like ALL is still to be defined, but they are mainly characterized by the activation of constitutive signal transduction pathways due to chimeric TKs different from BCR-ABL1. BCR-ABL1 like ALL patients represent a group with unfavorable outcome and are not identified by current risk criteria. In this review, we will discuss the design of targeted therapy for patients with BCR-ABL1 like ALL, which could consider TK inhibitors, and discuss innovative approaches suitable to identify the presence of patient's specific chimeric TK fusion genes, such as targeted locus amplification or proteomic biosensors.","['Franca, Raffaella', 'Kuzelicki, Natasa K', 'Sorio, Claudio', 'Toffoletti, Eleonora', 'Montecchini, Oksana', 'Poropat, Alice', 'Rabusin, Marco', 'Curci, Debora', 'Paladin, Dino', 'Stocco, Gabriele', 'Decorti, Giuliana']","['Franca R', 'Kuzelicki NK', 'Sorio C', 'Toffoletti E', 'Montecchini O', 'Poropat A', 'Rabusin M', 'Curci D', 'Paladin D', 'Stocco G', 'Decorti G']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'AB Analitica, Padova, Italy.', 'AB Analitica, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Child', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitriles', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Sirolimus/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'chemotherapy', 'hematologic malignancies', 'kinase-activating genetic lesions', 'lymphoblastic leukemia.']",2017/07/28 06:00,2018/07/20 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-85020 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867324666170727101932 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2018;25(24):2811-2825. doi: 10.2174/0929867324666170727101932.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aberrant expression and function of FLT3 are strongly related to leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemia. Its varieties of amino-acid residues mutations, such as FLT3-ITDs and -TKDs, can induce constant proliferation of hematological tumor cells with poor prognosis. Hence FLT3 serves as a promising target in AML chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This review focused on the progress of FLT3 inhibitors study including those that have entered clinical trials or were reported in numerous patents all over the world. Thus, we provided a useful reference for the development of new anti-leukemia drugs. METHOD: Through a comprehensive retrospective study, FLT3 inhibitors in several patent applications were identified and classified into five categories, including quinolone-related, indole-related, ureas, pyrimidines and other compounds. RESULTS: For each category of compounds, the structural feature, SAR, biological activity and current research status were thoroughly reviewed and analyzed. CONCLUSION: Although some of those compounds expressed potent bioactivities and have reached the advanced clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia, there are still several problems need to be faced before they enter the market eventually, especially the drug resistance issue. The improvement of therapeutic potency for FLT3 inhibitors might depend on the useful combination therapy and further refinement of the intrinsic properties of FLT3 inhibitors.","['Lan, Qing-Yuan', 'Zhi, Yan-Le', 'Heng, Hao', 'Tian, Jie-Yi', 'Guo, Xiao-Xing', 'Liu, Hai-Chun', 'Chen, Ya-Dong', 'Lu, Tao', 'Lu, Shuai']","['Lan QY', 'Zhi YL', 'Heng H', 'Tian JY', 'Guo XX', 'Liu HC', 'Chen YD', 'Lu T', 'Lu S']","['School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Design and Drug Discovery, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Design and Drug Discovery, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Design and Drug Discovery, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55414, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov,Recent patents on anti-cancer drug discovery,101266081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Patents as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3', 'clinical advance', 'drug resistance', 'patent', 'receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.']",2017/07/28 06:00,2018/07/11 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['PRA-EPUB-85045 [pii]', '10.2174/1574892812666170727154643 [doi]']",ppublish,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov. 2017 Nov 20;12(4):296-322. doi: 10.2174/1574892812666170727154643.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a relatively high risk of chemoresistant relapse even for the younger patients who can receive the most intensive antileukemic treatment. Treatment directed against the remaining leukemic and preleukemic stem cells will most likely reduce the risk of later relapse. Areas covered: Relevant publications were identified through literature searches. The authors searched for original articles and recent reviews describing (i) the characteristics of leukemic/preleukemic stem cells; (ii) the importance of the bone marrow stem cell niches in leukemogenesis; and (iii) possible therapeutic strategies to target the preleukemic/leukemic stem cells. Expert opinion: Leukemia relapse/progression seems to be derived from residual chemoresistant leukemic or preleukemic stem cells, and a more effective treatment directed against these cells will likely be important to improve survival both for patients receiving intensive treatment and leukemia-stabilizing therapy. Several possible strategies are now considered, including the targeting of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, proapoptotic intracellular signaling, cell metabolism, telomere activity and the AML-supporting effects by neighboring stromal cells. Due to disease heterogeneity, the most effective stem cell-directed therapy will probably differ between individual patients.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Tsykunova, Galina', 'Reikvam, Hakon']","['Bruserud O', 'Aasebo E', 'Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Tsykunova G', 'Reikvam H']","['a Division of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'a Division of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'c Proteomics Unit (PROBE), Department of Biomedicine , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'a Division of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'c Proteomics Unit (PROBE), Department of Biomedicine , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170727,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Recurrence']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*leukemia', '*leukemic stem cells', '*minimal residual disease', '*preleukemic stem cells', '*stabilizing treatment', '*stem cell niche', '*targeted therapy']",2017/07/28 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2017.1356818 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2017 Oct;12(10):1053-1065. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2017.1356818.

While the previously demonstrated inclined or lamellar settlers can be used for such perfusion bioreactors for microbial cells, the size and footprint requirements of such inefficiently scaled up devices can be quite large in comparison to the bioreactor size. Faced with this constraint, we have now developed novel, patent-pending compact cell settlers that can be used more efficiently with microbial perfusion bioreactors to achieve high cell densities and bioreactor productivities. Reproducible results from numerous month-long perfusion culture experiments using these devices attached to the 5 L perfusion bioreactor demonstrate very high cell densities due to substantial sedimentation of the larger live yeast cells which are returned to the bioreactor, while the harvest stream from the top of these cell settlers is a significantly clarified liquid, containing less than 30% and more typically less than 10% of the bioreactor cell concentration. Size of cells in the harvest is smaller than that of the cells in the bioreactor. Accumulated protein collected from the harvest and rate of protein accumulation is significantly (> 6x) higher than the protein produced in repeated fed-batch cultures over the same culture duration.

Recent studies have explored risk stratification and the safety of managing ""low-risk"" patients as outpatients. Few studies have directly assessed pediatric provider preferences for managing FN. PROCEDURE: We conducted a survey of practicing US and Canadian pediatric hematology/oncology (PHO) and pediatric infectious disease (PID) physicians to assess their FN management preferences using case scenarios with varying risk profiles. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent (n = 186) of PHO and 32% (n = 123) of PID physicians completed the survey. Overall, both groups of providers agreed regarding which patients with FN could be managed outpatient. For a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving maintenance chemotherapy with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 400 cells/mul, 35% (n = 66) of PHO and 49% (n = 60) of PID physicians would consider outpatient management (P = 0.02). Of those physicians selecting inpatient management, 41% (n = 49) of PHO and 52% (n = 33) of PID physicians would be willing to discharge the patient without an increase in ANC, if afebrile with a negative blood culture (P = 0.16). For a similar patient with an ANC of 100 cells/mul, only 23% (n = 35) of PHO and 42% (n = 39) of PID physicians would consider discharge without an increase in ANC (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of established guidelines for low-risk pediatric FN, a significant proportion of North American physicians report willingness to modify traditional management. This reinforces the need for evidence-based low-risk criteria and outpatient management guidelines to optimize consistency of care for these patients.","['Maxwell, Rochelle R', 'Egan-Sherry, Dana', 'Gill, Jonathan B', 'Roth, Michael E']","['Maxwell RR', 'Egan-Sherry D', 'Gill JB', 'Roth ME']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170727,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*therapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hematology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pediatrics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['outpatient management', 'pediatric febrile neutropenia', 'risk stratification']",2017/07/28 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26700 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26700.

Few epidemiologic indicators are available for the pediatric population. The objective of our study was to reliably estimate the number of AIHA cases in the French Aquitaine region and the incidence of AIHA in patients under 18 years old. PROCEDURE: In this retrospective study, the capture-recapture method and log-linear model were used for the period 2000-2008 in the Aquitaine region from the following three data sources for the diagnosis of AIHA: the OBS'CEREVANCE database cohort, positive DAT collected from the regional blood bank database, and the French medico-economic information system. RESULTS: A list of 281 different patients was obtained after cross-matching the three databases; 44 AIHA cases were identified in the period 2000-2008; and the total number of cases was estimated to be 48 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45-55). The calculated incidence of the disease was 0.81/100,000 children under 18 years old per year (95% CI 0.76-0.92). CONCLUSION: Accurate methods are required for estimating the incidence of AIHA in children. Capture-recapture analysis corrects underreporting and provides optimal completeness. This study highlights a possible under diagnosis of this potentially severe disease in various pediatric settings. AIHA incidence may now be compared with the incidences of other hematological diseases and used for clinical or research purposes.","['Aladjidi, Nathalie', 'Jutand, Marthe-Aline', 'Beaubois, Cyrielle', 'Fernandes, Helder', 'Jeanpetit, Julien', 'Coureau, Gaelle', 'Gilleron, Veronique', 'Kostrzewa, Aude', 'Lauroua, Pierre', 'Jeanne, Michel', 'Thiebaut, Rodolphe', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Perel, Yves']","['Aladjidi N', 'Jutand MA', 'Beaubois C', 'Fernandes H', 'Jeanpetit J', 'Coureau G', 'Gilleron V', 'Kostrzewa A', 'Lauroua P', 'Jeanne M', 'Thiebaut R', 'Leblanc T', 'Leverger G', 'Perel Y']","[""Pediatric Hematology Unit, Centre de Reference National des cytopenies auto-immunes de l'enfant (CEREVANCE), CIC 1401 INSERM CICP, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", 'ISPED, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'ISPED, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'The Leucegene Preclinical Laboratory and Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Research Centre, Maisonneuve-Osemont Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', ""Pediatric Hematology Unit, Centre de Reference National des cytopenies auto-immunes de l'enfant (CEREVANCE), CIC 1401 INSERM CICP, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", ""Pediatric Hematology Unit, Centre de Reference National des cytopenies auto-immunes de l'enfant (CEREVANCE), CIC 1401 INSERM CICP, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", 'ISPED, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""Service d'Information Medicale, Pole de Sante Publique, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", ""Service d'Information Medicale, Pole de Sante Publique, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", 'Aquitaine-Limousin Branch of the French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'Aquitaine-Limousin Branch of the French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'USMR and CIC-EC7, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Unit, CEREVANCE, Robert Debre Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Unit, CEREVANCE, Armand Trousseau Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', ""Pediatric Hematology Unit, Centre de Reference National des cytopenies auto-immunes de l'enfant (CEREVANCE), CIC 1401 INSERM CICP, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170727,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coombs Test', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'capture-recapture method', 'incidence estimates', 'pediatric']",2017/07/28 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26683 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26683.

Bone marrow transplants (BMTs) were performed to create genetically SCID and phenotypically immunocompetent breeding animals to establish a SCID colony for further characterization and research utilization. Of nine original BMT transfer recipients, only four achieved successful engraftment. At approximately 11 months of age, both animals homozygous for the ART16 mutation were diagnosed with T cell lymphoma. One of these ART16/ART16 recipients was a male who received a transplant from a female sibling; the tumors in this recipient consist primarily of Y chromosome-positive cells. The other ART16/ART16 animal also presented with leukemia in addition to T cell lymphoma, while one of the ART12/ART16 compound heterozygote recipients presented with a nephroblastoma at a similar age. Human Artemis SCID patients have reported cases of lymphoma associated with a ""leaky"" Artemis phenotype. The naturally occurring Artemis SCID pig offers a large animal model more similar to human SCID patients and may offer a naturally occurring cancer model and provides a valuable platform for therapy development.","['Powell, Ellis J', 'Graham, Jared', 'Ellinwood, N M', 'Hostetter, Jesse', 'Yaeger, Michael', 'Ho, Chak-Sum', 'Gault, Lynden', 'Norlin, Veronica', 'Snella, Elizabeth N', 'Jens, Jackie', 'Waide, Emily H', 'Boettcher, Adeline N', 'Kerrigan, Maureen', 'Rowland, Raymond R R', 'Ross, Jason W', 'Dekkers, Jack C M', 'Tuggle, Christopher K']","['Powell EJ', 'Graham J', 'Ellinwood NM', 'Hostetter J', 'Yaeger M', 'Ho CS', 'Gault L', 'Norlin V', 'Snella EN', 'Jens J', 'Waide EH', 'Boettcher AN', 'Kerrigan M', 'Rowland RRR', 'Ross JW', 'Dekkers JCM', 'Tuggle CK']","['Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Gift of Life Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.', 'Gift of Life Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.', 'Gift of Life Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States.', 'Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170712,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Artemis', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'pig', 'severe combined immunodeficiency']",2017/07/28 06:00,2017/07/28 06:01,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00813 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Jul 12;8:813. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00813. eCollection 2017.,['R24 OD019813/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC5506080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical manifestations range from neutropenia, lymphedema, deafness, to severe viral and mycobacterial infections, bone marrow failure, and acute myeloid leukemia. Patients also present with monocytopenia, dendritic cell, B- and natural killer (NK)-cell deficiency. We studied the T-cell and NK-cell compartments of four GATA2-deficient patients to assess if changes in these lymphocyte populations could be correlated with clinical phenotype. Patients with more severe clinical complications demonstrated a senescent T-cell phenotype whereas patients with lower clinical score had undetectable changes relative to controls. In contrast, patients' NK-cells demonstrated an immature/activated phenotype that did not correlate with clinical score, suggesting an intrinsic NK-cell defect. These studies will help us to determine the contribution of T- and NK-cell dysregulation to the clinical phenotype of GATA2 patients, and may help to establish the most accurate therapeutic options for these patients. Asymptomatic patients may be taken into consideration for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation when dysregulation of T-cell and NK-cell compartment is present.","['Ruiz-Garcia, Raquel', 'Rodriguez-Vigil, Carmen', 'Marco, Francisco Manuel', 'Gallego-Bustos, Fernando', 'Castro-Panete, Maria Jose', 'Diez-Alonso, Laura', 'Munoz-Ruiz, Carlos', 'Ruiz-Contreras, Jesus', 'Paz-Artal, Estela', 'Gonzalez-Granado, Luis Ignacio', 'Allende, Luis Miguel']","['Ruiz-Garcia R', 'Rodriguez-Vigil C', 'Marco FM', 'Gallego-Bustos F', 'Castro-Panete MJ', 'Diez-Alonso L', 'Munoz-Ruiz C', 'Ruiz-Contreras J', 'Paz-Artal E', 'Gonzalez-Granado LI', 'Allende LM']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion I+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hemato-Oncologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Seccion de Inmunologia, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion I+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Seccion de Inmunologia, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion I+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Inmunodeficiencias, Servicio de Pediatria, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion I+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Seccion de Inmunologia, Universidad de San Pablo CEU, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion I+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Inmunodeficiencias, Servicio de Pediatria, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion I+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170712,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GATA binding protein 2', 'T-cell', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'natural killer-cell', 'primary immunodeficiency']",2017/07/28 06:00,2017/07/28 06:01,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00802 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Jul 12;8:802. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00802. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5506090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of NK cells for the control of viral infections and cancer is supported among others by the findings that viruses and tumors use a multitude of mechanisms to subvert and evade the NK cell system. Infections and malignant diseases can further lead to the shaping of NK cell populations with altered reactivity. Counter measures of potential therapeutic impact include the blocking of inhibitory interactions between NK cell receptors and their cellular ligands, the enhancement of activating receptor signals, and the infusion of large numbers of ex vivo generated and selected NK cells. Moreover, the specific cross-linking of NK cells to their target cells using chimeric antigen receptors or therapeutic bi-/trispecific antibody reagents is a promising approach. In this context, NK cells stand out by their positive effects and safety demonstrated in most clinical trials so far. Based in part on results of the recent EC-sponsored project ""NATURIMMUN"" and considering additional published work in the field, we discuss below new developments and future directions that have the potential to further advance and establish NK cell-based therapies at the clinics on a broader scale.","['Hofer, Erhard', 'Koehl, Ulrike']","['Hofer E', 'Koehl U']","['Department of Vascular Biology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, IFB-Tx, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170712,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bispecific antibodies', 'cell therapy', 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'chimeric antigen receptors', 'immune evasion', 'immunotherapy', 'natural killer cells']",2017/07/28 06:00,2017/07/28 06:01,['2017/07/28 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00745 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Jul 12;8:745. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00745. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5506076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a very short in vivo half-life effectively limited its therapeutic development. We report a unique glycoengineering approach to enhance the half-life of EphA4 Fc. Progressive deletion of three demonstrated N-linked sites in EphA4 progressively increased in vivo half-life such that the triple mutant protein showed dramatically improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. Importantly, protein stability, affinity for ephrin ligands and antagonism of cell expressed EphA4 was fully preserved, enabling it to be developed as a broad spectrum Eph/ephrin antagonist for use in both acute and chronic diseases.","['Pegg, Cassandra L', 'Cooper, Leanne T', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Gerometta, Michael', 'Smith, Fiona M', 'Yeh, Michael', 'Bartlett, Perry F', 'Gorman, Jeffrey J', 'Boyd, Andrew W']","['Pegg CL', 'Cooper LT', 'Zhao J', 'Gerometta M', 'Smith FM', 'Yeh M', 'Bartlett PF', 'Gorman JJ', 'Boyd AW']","['Protein Discovery Centre, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Queensland, 4006, Australia.

Achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in CLL is an independent predictor of survival even with a variety of different treatment approaches and regardless of the line of therapy. METHODS/DESIGN: GA101 (obinutuzumab) monocLonal Antibody as Consolidation Therapy In CLL (GALACTIC) is a seamless phase II/III, multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open, parallel-group trial for patients with CLL who have recently responded to chemotherapy. Participants will be randomised to receive either obinutuzumab (GA-101) consolidation or no treatment (as is standard). The phase II trial will assess safety and short-term efficacy in order to advise on continuation to a phase III trial. The primary objective for phase III is to assess the effect of consolidation therapy on progression-free survival (PFS). One hundred eighty-eight participants are planned to be recruited from forty research centres in the United Kingdom. DISCUSSION: There is evidence that achieving MRD eradication with alemtuzumab consolidation is associated with improvements in survival and time to progression. This trial will assess whether obinutuzumab is safe in a consolidation setting and effective at eradicating MRD and improving PFS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, 64035629 .

However, to the authors' knowledge, few data exist regarding the prognostic impact of cytogenetic clonal evolution during the course of MDS. METHODS: The authors evaluated follow-up karyotype analyses in 549 patients from the Dusseldorf MDS Registry. RESULTS: Clonal evolution was detectable in 24% of the entire cohort and in 18% of 294 patients receiving best supportive care. The authors noted a clear adverse effect of clonal evolution on the risk of leukemic transformation (hazard ratio, 2.233; P = .036) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 3.677; P<.001). The authors also analyzed the prognostic influence of subclones detectable at the time of diagnosis. Again, such a finding was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival and a higher 5-year-probability of acute myeloid leukemia progression (30% vs 22%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study support the belief that follow-up karyotype analyses should be performed, especially in patients with lower-risk and intermediate-risk MDS, to identify those patients who are at higher risk of disease progression and therefore might benefit from earlier or more intensive treatment.

The presence of FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations leads to high rates of relapse and decreased overall survival. Patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplication are normally treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission. Nevertheless, the incidence of post-transplant relapse is considerable in this group of patients, and the management of this clinical condition is challenging. The report describes the outcomes of patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplication positive acute myeloid leukemia who relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and were treated with the combination of re-induction chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion, sorafenib and azacitidine. Three cases are described and all patients achieved prolonged complete remission with the combined therapy. The combination of induction chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion, and the maintenance with azacitidine and sorafenib can be effective approaches in the treatment of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant and relapsed FLT3 internal tandem duplication positive acute myeloid leukemia patients. This strategy should be further explored in the context of clinical trials.","['Campregher, Paulo Vidal', 'Mattos, Vinicius Renan Pinto de', 'Salvino, Marco Aurelio', 'Santos, Fabio Pires de Souza', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson']","['Campregher PV', 'Mattos VRP', 'Salvino MA', 'Santos FPS', 'Hamerschlak N']","['Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Sao Rafael, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']","['eng', 'por']",['Case Reports'],20170724,Brazil,Einstein (Sao Paulo),"Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101281800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Sorafenib', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2017/12/08 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1679-45082017005003102 [pii]', '10.1590/S1679-45082017RC3784 [doi]']",ppublish,Einstein (Sao Paulo). 2017 Jul-Sep;15(3):355-358. doi: 10.1590/S1679-45082017RC3784.

Several pharmacological properties have been described for different types of geopropolis, but there have been no previous studies of the geopropolis from Melipona mondury. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiproliferative activities of M. mondury geopropolis, and determined its chemical profile. The antioxidant activity was determined using in vitro ABTS.+, .DPPH, and beta-carotene/linoleic acid co-oxidation methods. The antibacterial activity was determined using a microdilution method with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The antiproliferative effect was determined in tumor cell lines using the Alamar Blue assay. The chemical profile was obtained using UHPLC-MS and UHPLC-MS/MS. The butanolic fraction had the highest concentration of phenolic compounds and more potent antioxidant properties in all assays. This fraction also had bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against all bacterial strains at low concentrations, especially S. aureus. The hexane fraction had the highest antiproliferative potential, with IC50 values ranging from 24.2 to 46.6 microg/mL in HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia cell) and K562 (human chronic myelocytic leukemia cell), respectively. Preliminary chemical analysis indicates the presence of terpenes and gallic acid in the geopropolis. Our results indicate the therapeutic potential of geopropolis from M. mondury against inflammatory, oxidative, infectious, and neoplastic diseases.","['Santos, Tassia L A Dos', 'Queiroz, Raphael F', 'Sawaya, Alexandra C H F', 'Lopez, Begona Gimenez-Cassina', 'Soares, Milena B P', 'Bezerra, Daniel P', 'Rodrigues, Ana Carolina B C', 'Paula, Vanderlucia F DE', 'Waldschmidt, Ana Maria']","['Santos TLAD', 'Queiroz RF', 'Sawaya ACHF', 'Lopez BG', 'Soares MBP', 'Bezerra DP', 'Rodrigues ACBC', 'Paula VF', 'Waldschmidt AM']","['Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia, Rua Jose Moreira Sobrinho, s/n, Jequiezinho, 45208-091 Jequie, BA, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Naturais, Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia, Estrada do Bem Querer, Km 04, s/n, 45031-900 Vitoria da Conquista, BA, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biologia e Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Rua Monteiro Lobato, 255, Cidade Universitaria, 13083-862 Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biologia e Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Rua Monteiro Lobato, 255, Cidade Universitaria, 13083-862 Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz/IGM-FIOCRUZ-BA, Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, 40296-710 Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Centro de Biotecnologia e Terapia Celular, Hospital Sao Rafael, Avenida Sao Rafael, 2152, Sao Marcos, 41253-190 Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz/IGM-FIOCRUZ-BA, Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, 40296-710 Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz/IGM-FIOCRUZ-BA, Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, 40296-710 Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Departmento de Quimica e Ciencias Exatas, Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia, Rua Jose Moreira Sobrinho, s/n, Jequiezinho, 45208-091 Jequie, BA, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia, Rua Jose Moreira Sobrinho, s/n, Jequiezinho, 45208-091 Jequie, BA, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170720,Brazil,An Acad Bras Cienc,Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,7503280,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Phenols)', '9009-62-5 (Propolis)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Bees/*chemistry', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Propolis/*chemistry', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*drug effects', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0001-37652017005012102 [pii]', '10.1590/0001-3765201720160725 [doi]']",ppublish,An Acad Bras Cienc. 2017;89(3 Suppl):2247-2259. doi: 10.1590/0001-3765201720160725.

A domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) presented intense dyspnea and died three days later. In the necropsy, the lungs were firm, without collapse and with many white areas; moderate lymphadenomegaly and splenomegaly were also observed. The histopathological examination showed severe necrotic interstitial bronchopneumonia and mild necrotic hepatitis, associated with intralesional cysts and tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii that were positive by anti-T. gondii immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation. The bone marrow showed chronic myeloid leukemia and the neoplastic cells were positive by anti-FeLV IHC evaluation. DNA extracted from lungs was positive for T. gondii by PCR targeting REP-529. T. gondii was characterized by PCR-RFLP and by the microsatellites technique. ToxoDB-PCR-RFLP #10, i.e. the archetypal type I, was identified. Microsatellite analysis showed that the strain was a variant of type I with two atypical alleles. This was the first time that a T. gondii clonal type I genotype was correlated with a case of acute toxoplasmosis in a host in Brazil.","['Pena, Hilda Fatima de Jesus', 'Evangelista, Camila Mariellen', 'Casagrande, Renata Assis', 'Biezus, Giovana', 'Wisser, Claudia Salete', 'Ferian, Paulo Eduardo', 'Moura, Anderson Barbosa de', 'Rolim, Veronica Machado', 'Driemeier, David', 'Oliveira, Solange', 'Alves, Bruna Farias', 'Gennari, Solange Maria', 'Traverso, Sandra Davi']","['Pena HFJ', 'Evangelista CM', 'Casagrande RA', 'Biezus G', 'Wisser CS', 'Ferian PE', 'Moura AB', 'Rolim VM', 'Driemeier D', 'Oliveira S', 'Alves BF', 'Gennari SM', 'Traverso SD']","['Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria Preventiva e Saude Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia - FMVZ, Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Centro de Ciencias Agroveterinarias - CAV, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, Lages, SC, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Centro de Ciencias Agroveterinarias - CAV, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, Lages, SC, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Centro de Ciencias Agroveterinarias - CAV, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, Lages, SC, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Centro de Ciencias Agroveterinarias - CAV, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, Lages, SC, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Centro de Ciencias Agroveterinarias - CAV, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, Lages, SC, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Centro de Ciencias Agroveterinarias - CAV, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, Lages, SC, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Patologia Clinica, Faculdade de Veterinaria - FaVet, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Patologia Clinica, Faculdade de Veterinaria - FaVet, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria Preventiva e Saude Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia - FMVZ, Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria Preventiva e Saude Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia - FMVZ, Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria Preventiva e Saude Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia - FMVZ, Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Centro de Ciencias Agroveterinarias - CAV, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, Lages, SC, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Rev Bras Parasitol Vet,Revista brasileira de parasitologia veterinaria = Brazilian journal of veterinary parasitology : Orgao Oficial do Colegio Brasileiro de Parasitologia Veterinaria,9440482,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brazil', 'Cat Diseases/parasitology/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Genotype', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*veterinary', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Toxoplasma/genetics', 'Toxoplasmosis, Animal/*pathology']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2017/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1984-29612017000200177 [pii]', '10.1590/S1984-29612017025 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Bras Parasitol Vet. 2017 Apr-Jun;26(2):177-184. doi: 10.1590/S1984-29612017025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the ICM exists only transiently in vivo, it remains unclear how sustained propagation of naive ES cells in vitro affects their stability and functionality. Here we show that prolonged culture of male mouse ES cells in 2i/L results in irreversible epigenetic and genomic changes that impair their developmental potential. Furthermore, we find that female ES cells cultured in conventional serum plus LIF medium phenocopy male ES cells cultured in 2i/L. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Mek1/2 is predominantly responsible for these effects, in part through the downregulation of DNA methyltransferases and their cofactors. Finally, we show that replacement of the Mek1/2 inhibitor with a Src inhibitor preserves the epigenetic and genomic integrity as well as the developmental potential of ES cells. Taken together, our data suggest that, although short-term suppression of Mek1/2 in ES cells helps to maintain an ICM-like epigenetic state, prolonged suppression results in irreversible changes that compromise their developmental potential.","['Choi, Jiho', 'Huebner, Aaron J', 'Clement, Kendell', 'Walsh, Ryan M', 'Savol, Andrej', 'Lin, Kaixuan', 'Gu, Hongcang', 'Di Stefano, Bruno', 'Brumbaugh,

Here we show that the derivation of female mouse ES cells in the presence of 2i and leukaemia inhibitory factor (2i/L ES cells) results in a widespread loss of DNA methylation, including a massive erasure of genomic imprints. Despite this global loss of DNA methylation, early-passage 2i/L ES cells efficiently differentiate into somatic cells, and this process requires genome-wide de novo DNA methylation. However, the majority of imprinting control regions (ICRs) remain unmethylated in 2i/L-ES-cell-derived differentiated cells. Consistently, 2i/L ES cells exhibit impaired autonomous embryonic and placental development by tetraploid embryo complementation or nuclear transplantation. We identified the derivation conditions of female ES cells that display 2i/L-ES-cell-like transcriptional signatures while preserving gamete-derived DNA methylation and autonomous developmental potential. Upon prolonged culture, however, female ES cells exhibited ICR demethylation regardless of culture conditions. Our results provide insights into the derivation of female ES cells reminiscent of the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos.","['Yagi, Masaki', 'Kishigami, Satoshi', 'Tanaka, Akito', 'Semi, Katsunori', 'Mizutani, Eiji', 'Wakayama, Sayaka', 'Wakayama, Teruhiko', 'Yamamoto, Takuya', 'Yamada, Yasuhiro']","['Yagi M', 'Kishigami S', 'Tanaka A', 'Semi K', 'Mizutani E', 'Wakayama S', 'Wakayama T', 'Yamamoto T', 'Yamada Y']","['Department of Life Science Frontiers, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Life Science Frontiers, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Life Science Frontiers, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.', 'Advanced Biotechnology Center, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.', 'Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.', 'Advanced Biotechnology Center, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.', 'Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.', 'Advanced Biotechnology Center, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, Yamanashi 400-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Life Science Frontiers, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'AMED-CREST, AMED 1-7-1 Otemachi, Chiyodaku, Tokyo 100-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Life Science Frontiers, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170726,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Genomic Imprinting/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['nature23286 [pii]', '10.1038/nature23286 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2017 Aug 10;548(7666):224-227. doi: 10.1038/nature23286.

RESULTS: Low-dose DAC combined with CS055 could effectively kill ALL cells by the reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis. This was also observed in primary cells from 17 ALL patients, especially for those with p16 gene deletion. Suppression of checkpoint kinase 1 phosphorylation and upregulation of gammaH2A.X expression was demonstrated to participate in DAC plus CS055-induced apoptosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expressions of LRP16, Ki67 and EGFR in breast cancer tissues of 86 cases were detected by the immunohistochemical method and the correlations between the expression of LRP16, Ki67 and EGFR and clinical pathologic factors and prognosis were investigated. RESULTS: Positive expression rates of LRP16, Ki67 and EGFR in breast cancer tissue were 52.3%, 70.9% and 16.3%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in the expression of RP16, Ki67 and EGFR between different age groups (p>0.05). The expression of LRP16 was correlated with clinical stage, histological grade, tumor size and lymphatic metastasis (p<0.05); the expression of Ki67 was correlated with clinical stage, histological grade, tumor size and lymphatic metastasis (p<0.05); the expression of EGFR was correlated with histological grade (p<0.05). Comparison of postoperative local recurrence and metastasis time between LRP 16 positive group and negative group showed statistically significant difference (p<0.05); comparison of postoperative local recurrence and metastasis time between Ki67 positive group and negative group also showed statistically significant difference (p<0.05); comparison of postoperative local recurrence and metastasis time between EGFR positive group and negative group showed no statistically significant difference (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of expression levels of LPR16, Ki67 and EGFR in breast cancer tissue improves the understanding of biological behaviors of breast cancer, which in turn provide clinical guidance in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis assessment.","['Yao, D-J', 'Qiao, S', 'Zhang, Y', 'Zhao, Y-T', 'Yuan, C-H']","['Yao DJ', 'Qiao S', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao YT', 'Yuan CH']","['The Second Affiliated Hospital of Mudanjiang Medical University, Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, China. 138048252381@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (MACROD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2018/07/11 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2017 Jul;21(3 Suppl):47-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To do this, we established four treatment groups. Group A was designed to culture hESCs in a three-dimensional system. The feeder cells and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were removed in Group B. In group C, hESCs were cultured with a variety of pro-angiogenic growth factors. In group D, hESCs were cultured with intact retinal support cells and extracellular matrix. On days 15 and 30, the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), and macrophage marker F4/80 were detected by immunofluorescence staining. ELISA was used to detect the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). RESULTS: At both 15 and 30 day timepoints, the highest PECAM1, alphaSMA, and F4/80 positive rates and SDF-1 expression levels were observed in group D, followed by group C, group B, with group A presenting the lowest expression of these proteins (p<0.05). Also, group D showed obvious angiogenesis structures. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that hESCs can differentiate into retinal vascular-like structures. The presence of intact retinal support cells, a variety of cytokines, and extracellular matrix components were essential to facilitate this differentiation.","['Pan, Y-Z', 'Wang, H', 'Gao, F']","['Pan YZ', 'Wang H', 'Gao F']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, Hubei, P.R.

ROC curves showed 1.0% MLL-PTD as the optimal diagnostic cutoff for complete remission (CR). Nineteen and 17 cases had MLL-PTD <1.0% (low-level group) and >/=1.0% (high-level group), respectively. The FAB type distribution (M2 incidence, 100% vs. 53%, p = .003) and double-CEBPA-mutation incidence (37% vs. 0%, p = .008) significantly differed between the groups, as did the CR rates after the first (78.9% vs. 35.3%, p = .008) and second chemotherapies (84.2% vs. 47.1%, p = .001). High MLL-PTD level was the only independent factor affecting the CR rate (odds ratio = 0.16, p = .024). The 24-month overall survival was significantly lower in the high-level group (52.6% vs. 29.4%, p = .043).

Compared with negative BM disease, concordant BM adversely impacted overall and progression-free survival, independent of the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and cell-of-origin classification. Once BM is concordantly involved, poor prognosis was not associated with the extent of BM involvement. Conversely, patients with discordant BM showed favorable overall survival similar to stage I-II DLBCL. A BM-adjusted IPI, using three parameters: concordant BM involvement, age >60 years, and performance status >1, improves the risk stratification for DLBCL with positive BM. Intensive immunochemotherapy seemingly rendered survival benefit for patients with concordant BM, as did rituximab maintenance for the discordant BM group. Frequently revealing adverse clinical and molecular characteristics, patients with concordant BM demonstrated gene expression signatures relevant to tumor cell proliferation, migration and immune escape. In conclusion, clinical and biological heterogeneity is seen in DLBCL with positive BM but concordant BM involvement represents a distinct subset with unfavorable gene signatures, high-risk clinicopathologic features and poor prognosis.","['Yao, Z', 'Deng, L', 'Xu-Monette, Z Y', 'Manyam, G C', 'Jain, P', 'Tzankov, A', 'Visco, C', 'Bhagat, G', 'Wang, J', 'Dybkaer, K', 'Tam, W', 'Hsi, E D', 'van Krieken, J H', 'Ponzoni, M', 'Ferreri, A J M', 'Moller, M B', 'Winter, J N', 'Piris, M A', 'Fayad, L', 'Liu, Y', 'Song, Y', 'Orlowski, R Z', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Li, Y', 'Cortes, J', 'Young, K H']","['Yao Z', 'Deng L', 'Xu-Monette ZY', 'Manyam GC', 'Jain P', 'Tzankov A', 'Visco C', 'Bhagat G', 'Wang J', 'Dybkaer K', 'Tam W', 'Hsi ED', 'van Krieken JH', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ferreri AJM', 'Moller MB', 'Winter JN', 'Piris MA', 'Fayad L', 'Liu Y', 'Song Y', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Li Y', 'Cortes J', 'Young KH']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'University of Basel, Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'San Raffaele H.

We recently described the upregulation of MAF (v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog) in PMF CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) compared to healthy donor. Here we demonstrated that MAF is also upregulated in PMF compared with the essential thrombocytemia (ET) and polycytemia vera (PV) HPCs. MAF overexpression and knockdown experiments shed some light into the role of MAF in PMF pathogenesis, by demonstrating that MAF favors the megakaryocyte and monocyte/macrophage commitment of HPCs and leads to the increased expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators. Among them, we focused our further studies on SPP1 and LGALS3. We assessed SPP1 and LGALS3 protein levels in 115 PMF, 47 ET and 24 PV patients plasma samples and we found that SPP1 plasma levels are significantly higher in PMF compared with ET and PV patients. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that SPP1 promotes fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells proliferation and collagen production. Strikingly, clinical correlation analyses uncovered that higher SPP1 plasma levels in PMF patients correlate with a more severe fibrosis degree and a shorter overall survival. Collectively our data unveil that MAF overexpression contributes to PMF pathogenesis by driving the deranged production of the profibrotic mediator SPP1.","['Ruberti, S', 'Bianchi, E', 'Guglielmelli,

Type I interferons (IFNs) are crucial molecules in the innate immune response to HCMV and are also known to upregulate several components of the interchromosomal multiprotein aggregates collectively referred to as nuclear domain 10 (ND10). In the context of herpesvirus infection, ND10 components are known to restrict gene expression. This raises the question as to whether key ND10 components (PML, Sp100 and hDaxx) act as anti-viral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) during HCMV infection. In this study, analysis of ND10 component transcription during HCMV infection demonstrated that PML and Sp100 were significantly upregulated whilst hDaxx expression remained unchanged. In cells engineered to block the production of, or response to, type I IFNs, upregulation of PML and Sp100 was not detected during HCMV infection. Furthermore, pre-treatment with an IFN-beta neutralizing antibody inhibited upregulation of PML and Sp100 during both infection and treatment with HCMV-infected cell supernatant. The significance of ND10 components functioning as anti-viral ISGs during HCMV infection was determined through knockdown of PML, Sp100 and hDaxx. ND10 knockdown cells were significantly more permissive to HCMV infection, as previously described but, in contrast to control cells, could support HCMV plaque formation following IFN-beta pre-treatment. This ability of HCMV to overcome the potently anti-viral effects of IFN-beta in ND10 expression deficient cells provides evidence that ND10 component upregulation is a key mediator of the anti-viral activity of IFN-beta.","['Ashley, Caroline L', 'Glass, Mandy S', 'Abendroth, Allison', 'McSharry, Brian P', 'Slobedman, Barry']","['Ashley CL', 'Glass MS', 'Abendroth A', 'McSharry BP', 'Slobedman B']","['Discipline of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Sydney Medical School, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown, New South Wales 2050, Australia.', 'MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.', 'Institute of Biomedical and Environmental Health Research, University of the West of Scotland, High Street, Paisley, Scotland, UK.', 'Discipline of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Sydney Medical School, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown, New South Wales 2050, Australia.', 'Discipline of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Sydney Medical School, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown, New South Wales 2050, Australia.', 'Discipline of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Sydney Medical School, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown, New South Wales 2050, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Autoantigens/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/immunology', 'Interferon-beta/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.000858 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2017 Jul;98(7):1795-1805. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.000858.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ascorbic acid (AA) is an essential nutrient that possess anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity against a number of malignant cell lines. This study delineates the effect of AA on Tax protein expression as well as NF-kappaB and MMP9 activity in two HTLV1-positive leukemia cells (HuT-102 and C91-PL). METHODS: The cytotoxic and antiproliferative effect of AA were studied by LDH release and MTT tests, respectively. The proteins expression level was assessed by western blotting. RT-PCR was used to study mRNAs level. Finally, ELISA/EMSA and Zymography were used to evaluate NF-kappaB and MMP-9 activities, respectively. RESULTS: Cell lines were treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of AA for 48h and 96h, which resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation at a concentration of 50microg/ml at 96h in both cell lines. The same concentration inhibited Tax protein expression as well as the NF-kappaB nuclearization and DNA binding activity. The inhibitory effect of AA on MMP9 protein expression and activity started at 100microg/ml and 50microg/ml in HuT-102 and C91-PL cells respectively, with no effect at the transcriptional levels of MMP-9 in either one of the two cell lines. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that while AA exerted its anti-proliferative effect on the NF- kappaB activation pathway by suppressing Tax expression, its effects on MMP9 seemed to be independent of this mechanism and follow a different approach.","['Harakeh, Steve', 'Khalife, Jihane', 'Baydoun, Elias', 'Azar, Rania', 'Al-Hejin, Ahmed', 'Barbour, Elie', 'Azhar, Esam', 'Niedzwiecki, Aleksandra', 'Al Jaouni, Soad', 'Diab-Assaf, Mona', 'Kamal, Mohammad A', 'Rath, Mathias']","['Harakeh S', 'Khalife J', 'Baydoun E', 'Azar R', 'Al-Hejin A', 'Barbour E', 'Azhar E', 'Niedzwiecki A', 'Al Jaouni S', 'Diab-Assaf M', 'Kamal MA', 'Rath M']","['Special Infectious Agents Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center; Yousef Abdullatif Jameel Chair of Prophetic Medicine Application, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University (KAU) Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biology Department, American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon.', 'Biology Department, American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon.', 'Lebanese University, EDST (""Molecular Tumor-genesis and Anticancer Pharmacology""), Hadath, Lebanon.', 'Biology Department, King Abdulaziz University P.O.Box: 80216, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Agriculture, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Special Infectious Agents Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center; Yousef Abdullatif Jameel Chair of Prophetic Medicine Application, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University (KAU) Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, KAU, Saudi Arabia.', 'Lebanese University, EDST (""Molecular Tumor-genesis and Anticancer Pharmacology""), Hadath, Lebanon.', 'King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, P.

Cisplatin (CDDP)-based systemic chemotherapy is the main pharmaceutical approach for treating NSCLC, but its effect is discounted by some hitherto unknown reasons. Thus, this study is dedicated to improving the efficacy of CDDP. Our results show that combining use of CDDP with CK2 siRNA or inhibitor is more efficient in suppressing cancer cell growth and promoting apoptosis than use of CDDP alone. The underlying mechanism is that CDDP has two pathways to go: one is that it directly induces apoptosis and the other is that it activates CK2, which suppresses proapoptosis gene promyelocytic leukemia (PML). In conclusion, inhibiting CK2 can enhance sensitivity of CDDP to NSCLC cancer cells through PML.","['Yang, Bo', 'Yao, Jinhong', 'Li, Bai', 'Shao, Guoguang', 'Cui, Yongsheng']","['Yang B', 'Yao J', 'Li B', 'Shao G', 'Cui Y']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 XinMin Street, Chaoyang, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 XinMin Street, Chaoyang, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Colorectal and anal Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 XinMin Street, Chaoyang, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 XinMin Street, Chaoyang, Changchun, Jilin, China. xfsong@xxmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 XinMin Street, Chaoyang, Changchun, Jilin, China. gaoji2015long@sina.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170725,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Casein Kinase II/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['CDDP', 'CK2', 'NSCLC', 'PML']",2017/07/27 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-017-3081-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-017-3081-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2017 Dec;436(1-2):87-97. doi: 10.1007/s11010-017-3081-2.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between radiotherapy for DCIS and risk of second non-breast cancers in a large US cohort. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 52,556 women in 12 U.S. population-based cancer registries diagnosed with first primary DCIS during 1992-2008 at age 25-79 years. We estimated relative risks (RRs), attributable risks (AR), and excess absolute risks (EAR) of second non-breast cancers associated with radiotherapy using Poisson regression adjusted for age at year of diagnosis, grade, hormonal therapy (yes/no or unknown), and time since diagnosis. RESULTS: Approximately half of the women (46.3%) received radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was associated with an increased risk of all second non-breast cancers combined [RR 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28] and all in-field, radiation-related second cancers combined (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.15-1.63), driven by second lung cancers (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10-1.60) and non-CLL leukemia (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.02-2.86). The estimated cumulative excess risk of all second non-breast cancers was 0.8% by 15 years after DCIS diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy was associated with an increased risk of second non-breast cancers. The specific excess of cancers at sites likely in/near the radiotherapy field suggests the findings are unlikely due exclusively to confounding, but further research into factors related to receipt of radiotherapy is needed. Our risk estimates can be used to help assess the balance of the risks and benefits of radiotherapy for DCIS and to inform clinical practice.","['Withrow, Diana R', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Schonfeld, Sara J', 'Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy']","['Withrow DR', 'Morton LM', 'Curtis RE', 'Schonfeld SJ', 'Berrington de Gonzalez A']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. diana.withrow@nih.gov.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170725,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Breast neoplasms', 'Ductal carcinoma in situ', 'Radiotherapy', 'Second cancers']",2017/07/27 06:00,2018/06/02 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2017/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10549-017-4410-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10549-017-4410-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2017 Nov;166(1):299-306. doi: 10.1007/s10549-017-4410-6.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine children with de novo ALL and 25 controls were enrolled in the study. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow. The mRNA levels of ABCA2 and ABCA3 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples with high mRNA levels were assessed for respective protein levels by Western blotting. Following the first year of treatment, persistent monoclonality of T-cell gamma receptors or immunoglobulin H (IgH) gene rearrangement was assessed and considered as the MDR. The tertiary structure of ABCA2 was predicted using Phyre2 and I-TASSER web systems and compared to that of ABCA3, which has been previously reported. Molecular docking was performed using DOCK 6.7. RESULTS: Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) showed high levels of ABCA2 and ABCA3 mRNAs in 13 and 17 samples, respectively. Among them, five and eight individuals demonstrated high levels of ABCA2 and ABCA3, respectively. Response to chemotherapy was significantly decreased (P=0.001) when the mRNA and protein of both genes were overexpressed compared to individuals with high transcriptional levels of either ABCA2 or ABCA3 alone. Close similarity between ABCA2 and ABCA3 structures was revealed by protein tertiary structure prediction, whereas molecular docking analysis suggested similar binding of chemotherapy drugs and therefore a potentially similar role in determining the MDR. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested, for the first time, that quantification of the protein level of ABCA2 and ABCA3 transporters had a prognostic impact on pediatric ALL MDR. Furthermore, the tertiary structure of ABCA2 was predicted for the first time, and docking analysis revealed a possible compensatory effect between ABCA2 and ABCA3 transporters, which may contribute to the efflux of cytotoxic drugs and, ultimately, to chemoresistance.","['Aberuyi, Narges', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Khosravi Dehaghi, Zohreh', 'Moafi, Alireza', 'Masotti, Andrea', 'Paolini, Alessandro']","['Aberuyi N', 'Rahgozar S', 'Khosravi Dehaghi Z', 'Moafi A', 'Masotti A', 'Paolini A']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan.', 'Department of Pediatric-Hematology-Oncology, Sayed-ol-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', ""Gene Expression - Microarrays Laboratory, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital-Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Rome, Italy."", ""Gene Expression - Microarrays Laboratory, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital-Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170710,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCA2 transporter', 'ABCA3 transporter', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'molecular docking', 'multidrug resistance', 'tertiary structure']",2017/07/27 06:00,2017/07/27 06:01,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S140488 [doi]', 'ott-10-3373 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Jul 10;10:3373-3380. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S140488. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5513879,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is currently unknown how common TP53 mutations with low variant allele frequency (VAF) are, whether they are linked to hydroxyurea (HU) cytoreduction, and what disease progression risk they carry. Using ultra-deep next-generation sequencing, we examined 254 MPN patients treated with HU, interferon alpha-2a or anagrelide and 85 untreated patients. We found TP53 mutations in 50 cases (0.2-16.3% VAF), regardless of disease subtype, driver gene status and cytoreduction. Both therapy and TP53 mutations were strongly associated with older age. Over-time analysis showed that the mutations may be undetectable at diagnosis and slowly increase during disease course. Although three patients with TP53 mutations progressed to TP53-mutated or TP53-wild-type AML, we did not observe a significant age-independent impact on overall survival during the follow-up. Further, we showed that complete p53 inactivation alone led to neither blast transformation nor HU resistance. Altogether, we revealed patient's age as the strongest factor affecting low-burden TP53 mutation incidence in MPN and found no significant age-independent association between TP53 mutations and hydroxyurea. Mutations may persist at low levels for years without an immediate risk of progression.","['Kubesova, B', 'Pavlova, S', 'Malcikova, J', 'Kabathova, J', 'Radova, L', 'Tom, N', 'Tichy, B', 'Plevova, K', 'Kantorova, B', 'Fiedorova, K', 'Slavikova, M', 'Bystry, V', 'Kissova, J', 'Gisslinger, B', 'Gisslinger, H', 'Penka, M', 'Mayer, J', 'Kralovics, R', 'Pospisilova, S', 'Doubek, M']","['Kubesova B', 'Pavlova S', 'Malcikova J', 'Kabathova J', 'Radova L', 'Tom N', 'Tichy B', 'Plevova K', 'Kantorova B', 'Fiedorova K', 'Slavikova M', 'Bystry V', 'Kissova J', 'Gisslinger B', 'Gisslinger H', 'Penka M', 'Mayer J', 'Kralovics R', 'Pospisilova S', 'Doubek M']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Blood Coagulation, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Blood Coagulation, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170724,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/drug effects/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*administration & dosage', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017230 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.230 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Feb;32(2):450-461. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.230.

Here we investigated the pathogenic role of the recurrent R98S mutation in ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10 R98S) found in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a critical controller of cellular proliferation and survival. A proteome screen revealed overexpression of several Jak-Stat signaling proteins in engineered RPL10 R98S mouse lymphoid cells, which we confirmed in hematopoietic cells from transgenic Rpl10 R98S mice and T-ALL xenograft samples. RPL10 R98S expressing cells displayed JAK-STAT pathway hyper-activation upon cytokine stimulation, as well as increased sensitivity to clinically used JAK-STAT inhibitors like pimozide. A mutually exclusive mutation pattern between RPL10 R98S and JAK-STAT mutations in T-ALL patients further suggests that RPL10 R98S functionally mimics JAK-STAT activation. Mechanistically, besides transcriptional changes, RPL10 R98S caused reduction of apparent programmed ribosomal frameshifting at several ribosomal frameshift signals in mouse and human Jak-Stat genes, as well as decreased Jak1 degradation. Of further medical interest, RPL10 R98S cells showed reduced proteasome activity and enhanced sensitivity to clinical proteasome inhibitors. Collectively, we describe modulation of the JAK-STAT cascade as a novel cancer-promoting activity of a ribosomal mutation, and expand the relevance of this cascade in leukemia.","['Girardi, T', 'Vereecke, S', 'Sulima, S O', 'Khan, Y', 'Fancello, L', 'Briggs, J W', 'Schwab, C', 'de Beeck, J Op', 'Verbeeck, J', 'Royaert, J', 'Geerdens, E', 'Vicente, C', 'Bornschein, S', 'Harrison, C J', 'Meijerink, J P', 'Cools, J', 'Dinman, J D', 'Kampen, K R', 'De Keersmaecker, K']","['Girardi T', 'Vereecke S', 'Sulima SO', 'Khan Y', 'Fancello L', 'Briggs JW', 'Schwab C', 'de Beeck JO', 'Verbeeck J', 'Royaert J', 'Geerdens E', 'Vicente C', 'Bornschein S', 'Harrison CJ', 'Meijerink JP', 'Cools J', 'Dinman JD', 'Kampen KR', 'De Keersmaecker K']","['Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven-University of Leuven, Center for Human Genetics, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven-University of Leuven, Center for Human Genetics, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven-University of Leuven, Center for Human Genetics, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Princess Maxima Center for pediatric oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven-University of Leuven, Center for Human Genetics, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, LKI-Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170724,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RPL10 protein, human)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Rpl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein L10', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017225 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.225 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Mar;32(3):809-819. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.225.

We show that the JAK2V617F-bearing vascular niche promotes the expansion of the JAK2V617F HSPCs in preference to JAK2WT HSPCs, potentially contributing to poor donor cell engraftment and disease relapse following stem cell transplantation. The expression of Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) and stem cell factor (SCF) were upregulated in JAK2V617F-bearing ECs compared to wild-type ECs, potentially accounting for this observation. We further identify that the thrombopoietin (TPO)/MPL signaling pathway is critical for the altered vascular niche function. A better understanding of how the vascular niche contributes to HSPC expansion and MPN development is essential for the design of more effective therapeutic strategies for patients with MPNs.","['Zhan, H', 'Lin, C H S', 'Segal, Y', 'Kaushansky, K']","['Zhan H', 'Lin CHS', 'Segal Y', 'Kaushansky K']","['Northport VA Medical Center, Northport, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Northport VA Medical Center, Northport, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Office of the Sr. Vice President, Health Sciences, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170724,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,2017/07/27 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2017/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017233 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.233 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Feb;32(2):462-469. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.233.

Midostaurin is an oral multikinase inhibitor that inhibits D816V-mutated KIT, a primary driver of SM pathogenesis. We conducted a phase II trial of midostaurin 100 mg twice daily, administered as 28-day cycles, in 26 patients (ASM, n=3; SM-AHN, n= 17; MCL, n=6) with at least one sign of organ damage. During the first 12 cycles, the overall response rate was 69% (major/partial response: 50/19%) with clinical benefit in all advanced SM variants. With ongoing therapy, 2 patients achieved a complete remission of their SM. Midostaurin produced a 50% reduction in bone marrow mast cell burden and serum tryptase level in 68% and 46% of patients, respectively. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 40 months, and 18.5 months for MCL patients. Low-grade gastrointestinal side effects were common and manageable with antiemetics. The most frequent grade 3/4 nonhematologic and hematologic toxicities were asymptomatic hyperlipasemia (15%) and anemia (12%). With median follow-up of 10 years, no unexpected toxicities emerged.

The central feature of Huntington's disease pathology is the aggregation of mutant Huntingtin (Htt) protein into micrometer-sized inclusion bodies. Soluble mutant Htt states are most proteotoxic and trigger an enhanced risk of death whereas inclusions confer different changes to cellular health, and may even provide adaptive responses to stress. Yet the molecular mechanisms underpinning these changes remain unclear. Using the flow cytometry method of pulse-shape analysis (PulSA) to sort neuroblastoma (Neuro2a) cells enriched with mutant or wild-type Htt into different aggregation states, we clarified which transcriptional signatures were specifically attributable to cells before versus after inclusion assembly. Dampened CREB signalling was the most striking change overall and invoked specifically by soluble mutant Httex1 states. Toxicity could be rescued by stimulation of CREB signalling. Other biological processes mapped to different changes before and after aggregation included NF-kB signalling, autophagy, SUMOylation, transcription regulation by histone deacetylases and BRD4, NAD+ biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis and altered HIF-1 signalling. These findings open the path for therapeutic strategies targeting key molecular changes invoked prior to, and subsequently to, Httex1 aggregation.","['Moily, Nagaraj S', 'Ormsby, Angelique R', 'Stojilovic, Aleksandar', 'Ramdzan, Yasmin M', 'Diesch, Jeannine', 'Hannan, Ross D', 'Zajac, Michelle S', 'Hannan, Anthony J', 'Oshlack, Alicia', 'Hatters, Danny M']","['Moily NS', 'Ormsby AR', 'Stojilovic A', 'Ramdzan YM', 'Diesch J', 'Hannan RD', 'Zajac MS', 'Hannan AJ', 'Oshlack A', 'Hatters DM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia.', 'Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia; Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia; The John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Acton, ACT, Australia.', 'Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne Brain Centre, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne Brain Centre, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.

Although appropriate diagnosis and rapid treatment initiation are crucially important particularly in immunocompromised patients, selection of antibiotics without identification of causative bacteria is often challenging. A 44-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under myelosuppression suffered from teicoplanin-resistant gram-positive cocci bacteremia. Taking severe neutropenia due to chemotherapy and glycopeptide-resistance into account, teicoplanin was empirically substituted with daptomycin, which led to prompt defervescence. This microorganism later turned out to be Leuconostoc lactis (L. Lactis), and daptmycin was continued to use based on antimicrobial susceptibility tests. As a result, empiric use of daptomycin successfully controlled glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive cocci bacteremia under neutropenia.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records from patients identified in a list of 250 new patients attending the tertiary Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic, Ribeirao Preto Medical School hospital, University of Sao Paulo, from July 2013 to July 2015, whose final diagnosis was cancer. RESULTS: Of 250 patients seen during the study period, 5 (2%) had a cancer diagnosis. Among them, 80% had constitutional symptoms, especially weight loss and asthenia, and 60% had arthritis. Initially, all patients had at least one alteration in their blood count, lactate dehydrogenase was increased in 80% and a bone marrow smear was conclusive in 60% of patients. Bone and intestine biopsies were necessary for the diagnosis in 2 patients. JIA was the most common initial diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2 patients), M3 acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma (one case each). Of 5 patients studied, 3 (60%) are in remission and 2 (40%) died, one of them with prior use of steroids. CONCLUSION: The constitutional and musculoskeletal symptoms common to rheumatic and neoplastic diseases can delay the diagnosis and consequently worsen the prognosis of neoplasms.

Detection of fusion genes currently employ use of either conventional RT-PCR methods or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), where both methods involve tedious methodologies and require prior characterization of chromosomal translocation events as determined by cytogenetic analysis. In this study, we describe a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)-based multi-fusion gene screening method with the capacity to detect 22 fusion genes commonly found in leukemia. This method does not require pre-characterization of gene translocation events, thereby facilitating immediate diagnosis and therapeutic management. METHODS: We performed fluorescent qRT-PCR (F-qRT-PCR) using a commercially-available multi-fusion gene detection kit on a patient cohort of 345 individuals comprising 108 cases diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for initial evaluation; remaining patients within the cohort were assayed for confirmatory diagnosis. Results obtained by F-qRT-PCR were compared alongside patient analysis by cytogenetic characterization. RESULTS: Gene translocations detected by F-qRT-PCR in AML cases were diagnosed in 69.4% of the patient cohort, which was comparatively similar to 68.5% as diagnosed by cytogenetic analysis, thereby demonstrating 99.1% concordance. Overall gene fusion was detected in 53.7% of the overall patient population by F-qRT-PCR, 52.9% by cytogenetic prediction in leukemia, and 9.1% in non-leukemia patients by both methods. The overall concordance rate was calculated to be 99.0%. Fusion genes were detected by F-qRT-PCR in 97.3% of patients with CML, followed by 69.4% with AML, 33.3% with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 9.1% with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 0% with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CONCLUSIONS: We describe the use of a F-qRT-PCR-based multi-fusion gene screening method as an efficient one-step diagnostic procedure as an effective alternative to lengthy conventional diagnostic procedures requiring both cytogenetic analysis followed by targeted quantitative reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) methods, thus allowing timely patient management.","['Lyu, Xiaodong', 'Wang, Xianwei', 'Zhang, Lina', 'Chen, Zhenzhu', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Hu, Jieying', 'Fan, Ruihua', 'Song, Yongping']","['Lyu X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang L', 'Chen Z', 'Zhao Y', 'Hu J', 'Fan R', 'Song Y']","['School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China. songyongping@medmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170725,England,Diagn Pathol,Diagnostic pathology,101251558,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Oncogene Fusion/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'CLL', 'Chromosomal rearrangement', 'F-qRT-PCR', 'Gene fusion', 'Leukemia', 'MDS']",2017/07/27 06:00,2018/02/08 06:00,['2017/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13000-017-0634-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-017-0634-3 [pii]']",epublish,Diagn Pathol. 2017 Jul 25;12(1):55. doi: 10.1186/s13000-017-0634-3.,,,,PMC5526257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transfer of the immunotherapeutic concepts to the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is hampered by various characteristics of the disease, including non-leukemia-restricted target antigen expression profile, low endogenous immune responses, and intrinsic resistance mechanisms of the leukemic blasts against immune responses. However, considerable progress has been made in this field in the past few years.Within this manuscript, we review the recent developments and the current status of the five currently most prominent immunotherapeutic concepts: (1) antibody-drug conjugates, (2) T cell-recruiting antibody constructs, (3) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, (4) checkpoint inhibitors, and (5) dendritic cell vaccination. We focus on the clinical data that has been published so far, both for newly diagnosed and refractory/relapsed AML, but omitting immunotherapeutic concepts in conjunction with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Besides, we have included important clinical trials that are currently running or have recently been completed but are still lacking full publication of their results.While each of the concepts has its particular merits and inherent problems, the field of immunotherapy of AML seems to have taken some significant steps forward. Results of currently running trials will reveal the direction of further development including approaches combining two or more of these concepts.","['Lichtenegger, Felix S', 'Krupka, Christina', 'Haubner, Sascha', 'Kohnke, Thomas', 'Subklewe, Marion']","['Lichtenegger FS', 'Krupka C', 'Haubner S', 'Kohnke T', 'Subklewe M']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Translational Cancer Immunology, Gene Center, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Translational Cancer Immunology, Gene Center, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Translational Cancer Immunology, Gene Center, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Translational Cancer Immunology, Gene Center, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.

In patients who have a molecular relapse, a DMR is rapidly regained upon treatment re-initiation. METHODS: The authors report the results from RE-STIM, a French observational, multicenter study that evaluated treatment-free remission (TFR) in 70 patients who re-attempted TKI discontinuation after a first unsuccessful attempt. After the second TKI discontinuation attempt, the trigger for treatment re-introduction was the loss of a major molecular response in all patients. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 38.3 months (range, 4.7-117 months), and 45 patients (64.3%) lost a major molecular response after a median time off therapy of 5.3 months (range, 2-42 months). TFR rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.6%-61.5%), 42% (95% CI, 31.5%-55.4%), and 35% (95% CI, 24.4%-49.4%), respectively. No progression toward advanced-phase CML occurred, and no efficacy issue was observed upon TKI re-introduction. In univariate analysis, the speed of molecular relapse after the first TKI discontinuation attempt was the only factor significantly associated with outcome. The TFR rate at 24 months was 72% (95% CI, 48.8%-100%) in patients who remained in DMR within the first 3 months after the first TKI discontinuation and 36% (95% CI, 25.8%-51.3%) for others. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that a second TKI discontinuation attempt is safe and that a first failed attempt at discontinuing TKI does not preclude a second successful attempt.

Herein, the authors sought to analyze the characteristics, prognostic factors, and survival outcomes in patients with CML-BP in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. METHODS: A total of 477 patients with CML-BP were treated with a TKI at some point during the course of their CML. Cox proportional hazard models identified characteristics that were predictive of survival. Overall survival and failure-free survival were assessed. Optimal cutoff points for specific parameters were identified using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range, 16-84 years) and 64% were male. Approximately 80% of patients initially were diagnosed in the chronic phase of CML at a median of 41 months (range, 0.7-298 months) before transformation to CML-BP. De novo CML-BP occurred in 71 patients. Approximately 72% of patients received TKI therapy before CML-BP. The initial therapy for CML-BP included a TKI alone (35%), a TKI with chemotherapy (46%), and non-TKI therapies (19%). The median overall survival was 12 months and the median failure-free survival was 5 months. In multivariate analysis, myeloid immunophenotype, prior TKI, age >/=58 years, lactate dehydrogenase level >/=1227 IU/L, platelet count < 102 K/muL, no history of stem cell transplantation, transition to BP from chronic phase/accelerated phase, and the presence of chromosome 15 aberrations predicted for a significantly increased risk of death. Achievement of major hematologic response and/or complete cytogenetic response to first-line treatment was found to be predictive of better survival. The combination of a TKI with intensive chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation appeared to confer the best outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CML-BP continue to pose a therapeutic challenge, have dismal outcomes, and require newer treatment approaches. Cancer 2017;123:4391-402.

Previous studies have highlighted the importance of PML-RARalpha degradation in the treatment against APL. Considering the presence of two zinc fingers in the PML-RARalpha fusion protein, we explored the function of zinc homeostasis in maintaining PML-RARalpha stability. We demonstrated for the first time that zinc depletion by its chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) triggered PML-RARalpha degradation in NB4 APL cells via the proteasome pathway rather than the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. In contrast, autophagy protected TPEN-mediated PML-RARalpha degradation in NB4 APL cells. We further demonstrated that crosstalk between zinc homeostasis and nitric oxide pathway played a key role in maintaining PML-RARalpha stability in NB4 APL cells. These results demonstrate that zinc homeostasis is vital for maintaining PML-RARalpha stability, and zinc depletion by TPEN may be useful as a potential strategy to trigger PML-RARalpha degradation in APL cells. We also found that TPEN triggered apoptosis of NB4 APL cells in a time-dependent manner. The relationship between PML-RARalpha degradation and apoptosis triggered by TPEN deserves further study.","['Zhu, Bo', 'Wang, Jia-Yu', 'Zhou, Jun-Jie', 'Zhou, Feng', 'Cheng, Wei', 'Liu, Ying-Ting', 'Wang, Jie', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Chen, Dian-Hua', 'Luo, Lan', 'Hua, Zi-Chun']","['Zhu B', 'Wang JY', 'Zhou JJ', 'Zhou F', 'Cheng W', 'Liu YT', 'Wang J', 'Chen X', 'Chen DH', 'Luo L', 'Hua ZC']","['The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.

For instance, modifications of RUNX transcription factors dosage are associated with several diseases, including hematopoietic malignancies. In Drosophila, Myeloid Leukemia Factor (MLF) has been shown to control blood cell development by stabilizing the RUNX transcription factor Lozenge (Lz). However, the mechanism of action of this conserved family of proteins involved in leukemia remains largely unknown. Here we further characterized MLF's mode of action in Drosophila blood cells using proteomic, transcriptomic and genetic approaches. Our results show that MLF and the Hsp40 co-chaperone family member DnaJ-1 interact through conserved domains and we demonstrate that both proteins bind and stabilize Lz in cell culture, suggesting that MLF and DnaJ-1 form a chaperone complex that directly regulates Lz activity. Importantly, dnaj-1 loss causes an increase in Lz+ blood cell number and size similarly as in mlf mutant larvae. Moreover we find that dnaj-1 genetically interacts with mlf to control Lz level and Lz+ blood cell development in vivo. In addition, we show that mlf and dnaj-1 loss alters Lz+ cell differentiation and that the increase in Lz+ blood cell number and size observed in these mutants is caused by an overactivation of the Notch signaling pathway. Finally, using different conditions to manipulate Lz activity, we show that high levels of Lz are required to repress Notch transcription and signaling. All together, our data indicate that the MLF/DnaJ-1-dependent increase in Lz level allows the repression of Notch expression and signaling to prevent aberrant blood cell development. Thus our findings establish a functional link between MLF and the co-chaperone DnaJ-1 to control RUNX transcription factor activity and Notch signaling during blood cell development in vivo.","['Miller, Marion', 'Chen, Aichun', 'Gobert, Vanessa', 'Auge, Benoit', 'Beau, Mathilde', 'Burlet-Schiltz, Odile', 'Haenlin, Marc', 'Waltzer, Lucas']","['Miller M', 'Chen A', 'Gobert V', 'Auge B', 'Beau M', 'Burlet-Schiltz O', 'Haenlin M', 'Waltzer L']","['Centre de Biologie du Developpement (CBD), Centre de Biologie Integrative (CBI), Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Biologie du Developpement (CBD), Centre de Biologie Integrative (CBI), Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Biologie du Developpement (CBD), Centre de Biologie Integrative (CBI), Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Biologie du Developpement (CBD), Centre de Biologie Integrative (CBI), Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Biologie du Developpement (CBD), Centre de Biologie Integrative (CBI), Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Biologie du Developpement (CBD), Centre de Biologie Integrative (CBI), Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170725,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DnaJ-1 protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Mlf protein, Drosophila)', '0 (N protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (lz protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/growth & development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Larva/genetics/growth & development', 'Proteomics', 'Receptors, Notch/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,,2017/07/26 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1006932 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-17-00480 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2017 Jul 25;13(7):e1006932. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006932. eCollection 2017 Jul.,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9800-2826', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5361-727X']",PMC5549762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sample preparation was based on protein precipitation with acetonitrile and subsequent centrifugation. Isotope-labeled analogues for each analyte were used as internal standards. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a 50 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 mum polar Hypersil Gold C18 column and mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile (45%/55%, vol/vol) at a flow rate of 340 muL/min. The triazoles were simultaneously detected using a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in selected reaction monitoring mode with positive heated electrospray ionization within a single runtime of t = 3.00 minutes. RESULTS: Linearity of all azole concentration ranges was verified by the Mandel test and demonstrated for all azoles. All calibration curves were linear and fitted using least squares regression with a weighting factor of the reciprocal concentration. Limits of detection (mug/L/L) were FLZ, 9.3; ISZ, 0.3; ITZ, 0.6; OH-ITZ, 8.6; PSZ, 3.4; and VRZ, 2.1. The lower limits of quantitation (mug/L/liter) were FLZ, 28.3; ISZ, 1.0; ITZ, 1.7; OH-ITZ, 26.2; PSZ, 10.3; and VRZ, 6.3. Intraday and interday precisions ranged from 0.6% to 6.6% for all azoles. Intraday and interday accuracies (%bias) of all analytes were within 10.5%. In addition, we report on a 29-year-old white woman (94 kg body weight) with a history of acute myeloid leukemia who underwent stem cell transplantation. Because of diagnosis of aspergillus pneumonia, antifungal pharmacotherapy was initiated with different application modes and dosages of ISZ, and plasma concentrations were monitored over a time period of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: A precise and highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed that enables quantification of triazoles in plasma and serum matrix across therapeutically relevant concentration ranges. It was successfully implemented in our therapeutic drug monitoring routine service and is suitable for routine monitoring of antifungal therapy and in severely ill patients.","['Muller, Carsten', 'Gehlen, David', 'Blaich, Cornelia', 'Prozeller, Domenik', 'Liss, Blasius', 'Streichert, Thomas', 'Wiesen, Martin H J']","['Muller C', 'Gehlen D', 'Blaich C', 'Prozeller D', 'Liss B', 'Streichert T', 'Wiesen MHJ']","['*Center of Pharmacology, Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne; daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of Cologne, Cologne; double daggerDepartment of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne; and section signInstitute for Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Acetonitriles)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '60UTO373KE (isavuconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'Z072SB282N (acetonitrile)']",IM,"['Acetonitriles/blood', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*blood', 'Calibration', 'Chromatography, Liquid/*methods', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/blood', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/chemistry', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', 'Itraconazole/blood', 'Nitriles/blood', 'Plasma/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/blood', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Triazoles/blood', 'Voriconazole/blood']",,,2017/07/26 06:00,2018/05/17 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FTD.0000000000000438 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2017 Oct;39(5):505-513. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000438.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated growth and pubertal patterns in survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: Longitudinal assessment of anthropometric measurements and pubertal status was performed in a retrospective cohort of survivors (n=183). Median age at last endocrine visit was 16.1 years (range 8.2-27.6); median follow-up time was 8.7 years (range 3-21.4). RESULTS: Treatment with chemotherapy+prophylactic cranial radiation (pCRT, n=29) was associated with lower mean height standard deviation score (SDS) than chemotherapy alone (n=154) (p=0.001) and higher prevalence of adult short stature (13% vs. 2.2%). Mean age at pubertal onset was normal (girls: 10.3+/-1.3 years; boys: 12.0+/-1.3 years). Precocious puberty, diagnosed in 8.7% of patients, was more prevalent in pCRT-treated girls. Rates of overweight and obesity were 22.9% and 9.3%, respectively. Predictors of endocrine disorders were pCRT (p=0.031) and female gender (p=0.041); of obesity, higher body mass index (BMI)-SDS at diagnosis (p=0.001); and of short stature, lower height-SDS at diagnosis (p=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Most childhood ALL survivors given chemotherapy alone attain normal adult height and puberty. Childhood ALL survivors are at increased risk of overweight, especially those with increased BMI at diagnosis.

All studies had PFS as the primary end point, and none were powered for overall survival (OS) as a primary end point. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to better understand the impact of lenalidomide maintenance in this setting. Patients and Methods The meta-analysis was conducted using primary-source patient-level data and documentation from three RCTs (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 100104, Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto RV-MM-PI-209, and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome 2005-02) that met the following prespecified inclusion criteria: an RCT in patients with NDMM receiving ASCT followed by lenalidomide maintenance versus placebo or observation with patient-level data available and achieved database lock for primary efficacy analysis. Results Overall, 1,208 patients were included in the meta-analysis (605 patients in the lenalidomide maintenance group and 603 in the placebo or observation group). The median PFS was 52.8 months for the lenalidomide group and 23.5 months for the placebo or observation group (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.55). At a median follow-up time of 79.5 months for all surviving patients, the median OS had not been reached for the lenalidomide maintenance group, whereas it was 86.0 months for the placebo or observation group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.90; P = .001). The cumulative incidence rate of a second primary malignancy before disease progression was higher with lenalidomide maintenance versus placebo or observation, whereas the cumulative incidence rates of progression, death, or death as a result of myeloma were all higher with placebo or observation versus lenalidomide maintenance. Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates a significant OS benefit and confirms the PFS benefit with lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT in patients with NDMM when compared with placebo or observation.","['McCarthy, Philip L', 'Holstein, Sarah A', 'Petrucci, Maria Teresa', 'Richardson, Paul G', 'Hulin, Cyrille', 'Tosi, Patrizia', 'Bringhen, Sara', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Caillot, Denis', 'Gay, Francesca', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Marit, Gerald', 'Jung, Sin-Ho', 'Yu, Zhinuan', 'Winograd, Benjamin', 'Knight, Robert D', 'Palumbo, Antonio', 'Attal, Michel']","['McCarthy PL', 'Holstein SA', 'Petrucci MT', 'Richardson PG', 'Hulin C', 'Tosi P', 'Bringhen S', 'Musto P', 'Anderson KC', 'Caillot D', 'Gay F', 'Moreau P', 'Marit G', 'Jung SH', 'Yu Z', 'Winograd B', 'Knight RD', 'Palumbo A', 'Attal M']","['Philip L.

However, due to the high cost of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, access to this highly effective therapy with strict monitoring strategies is limited in low to middle-income countries. In this context, following standard recommendations proposed by experts in developed countries is difficult. Areas covered: This review aims to provide an insight into the management of patients with CML living in a resource-limited setting. It addresses several issues: diagnosis, initial treatment, disease monitoring, and additional treatment alternatives including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Expert commentary: Imatinib is probably the most cost-effective TKI for initial treatment in developing and underdeveloped countries. Generic imatinib preparations should be evaluated before considering their widespread use. Adherence to treatment should be emphasized. Adequate monitoring can be performed through several methods successfully and is important for predicting outcomes, particularly early in the first year, and if treatment suspension is being considered. Access to further therapeutic alternatives should define our actions after failure or intolerance to imatinib, preferring additional TKIs if possible. Allogeneic transplantation in chronic phase is a viable option in this context.","['Gomez-de-Leon, Andres', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David', 'Ruiz-Delgado, Guillermo J', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J']","['Gomez-de-Leon A', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Ruiz-Delgado GJ', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['a Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Facultad de Medicina y Hospital Universitario ""Dr.Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"".

Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a negative regulator of JAK-STAT3. SOCS3 downregulation is associated with drug resistance in breast cancer and leukemia. However, its role in bladder cancer drug resistance is still unclear. This study established ADM resistant bladder cancer cell model to investigate the role of SOCS3-JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway ADM resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ADM drug resistant cell line T24/ADM was established. SOCS3, p-JAK2, p-JAK3, and Bcl-2 expressions in T24/ADM, T24, and HBEC cells were compared. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. T24/ADM cells were divided into five groups, including control, pSicoR-blank, pSicoR-SOCS3, FLLL32, and pSicoR-SOCS3 + FLLL32 groups. Cell proliferation was determined by EdU staining. RESULTS: SOCS3 was reduced, while p-JAK2, p-STAT3, and Bcl-2 expressions upregulated in T24 cells compared with HBEC cells. T24/ADM cells exhibited lower SOCS3, higher p-JAK2, p-STAT3, and Bcl-2 levels than T24 cells. Cell apoptosis was higher, whereas cell proliferation was weaker in T24 cells compared with T24/ADM cells. SOCS3 overexpression and/or FLLL32 treatment significantly downregulated p-JAK2, p-STAT3, and Bcl-2 expressions, attenuated cell proliferation, and elevated sensitivity to ADM induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: SOCS3 reduction was associated with bladder cancer sensitivity to ADM. SOCS3 overexpression decreased JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway activity, declined Bcl-2 expression, inhibited cell proliferation, elevated cell apoptosis, and enhanced ADM sensitivity in T24 cells.","['Li, M-Z', 'Lai, D-H', 'Zhao, H-B', 'Chen, Z', 'Huang, Q-X', 'Situ, J']","['Li MZ', 'Lai DH', 'Zhao HB', 'Chen Z', 'Huang QX', 'Situ J']","['Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. jiesitu668@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/biosynthesis', 'Janus Kinase 3/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology']",,,2017/07/26 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2017 Jul;21(13):3005-3011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 Dec;24(23):11985.

The aim of this study is to show updated patterns of temporal behavior using data of the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont (CCRP), a region with approximately 4.5 million inhabitants in North-West Italy. CCRP has been recording incident cases in children (0-14 years) since 1967 and in adolescents (15-19) since 2000. Time trends were estimated as annual percent change (APC) over the 1976-2011 period for children, and over 2000-2011 for both children and adolescents. CCRP registered 5020 incident cases from 1967 to 2011. Incidence rates were 157 per million person-years for children (1967-2011) and 282 for adolescents (2000-2011). From 1976-2011, increasing trends were observed in children for all neoplasms (APC 1.1, 95%CI: 0.8; 1.5) and for both embryonal and non-embryonal tumors: 1.1%, (0.5; 1.6) and 1.2%, (0.7; 1.6), respectively. Increases were observed in several tumor types, including leukemia, lymphoma, central nervous system tumors and neuroblastoma. In 2000-2011, incidence rates showed mostly non statistically significant variations and large variability. The observation of trends over a long period shows that the incidence of most tumors has increased, and this is only partially explained by diagnostic changes. Large rate variability hampers interpretation of trend patterns in short periods. Given that no satisfying explanation for the increases observed in the past was ever found, efforts must be made to understand and interpret this peculiar and still ununderstood pattern of childhood cancer incidence.","['Isaevska, Elena', 'Manasievska, Milena', 'Alessi, Daniela', 'Mosso, Maria Luisa', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Sacerdote, Carlotta', 'Pastore, Guido', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Merletti, Franco', 'Maule, Milena']","['Isaevska E', 'Manasievska M', 'Alessi D', 'Mosso ML', 'Magnani C', 'Sacerdote C', 'Pastore G', 'Fagioli F', 'Merletti F', 'Maule M']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Unit of Medical Statistics and Cancer Epidemiology, CPO Piemonte and University of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', ""Pediatric Onco-Haematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Turin, Italy."", 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170724,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/07/26 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0181805 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-14556 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jul 24;12(7):e0181805. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0181805. eCollection 2017.,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1846-7990'],PMC5524393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax governs the transcription from the viral 5'LTR, enhancing thereby its own expression, via the recruitment of dimers of phosphorylated CREB to cAMP-response elements located within the U3 region (vCRE). In addition to phosphorylation, CREB is also the target of O-GlcNAcylation, another reversible post-translational modification involved in a wide range of diseases, including cancers. O-GlcNAcylation consists in the addition of O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on Serine or Threonine residues, a process controlled by two enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which transfers O-GlcNAc on proteins, and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which removes it. In this study, we investigated the status of O-GlcNAcylation enzymes in HTLV-1-transformed T cells. We found that OGA mRNA and protein expression levels are increased in HTLV-1-transformed T cells as compared to control T cell lines while OGT expression is unchanged. However, higher OGA production coincides with a reduction in OGA specific activity, showing that HTLV-1-transformed T cells produce high level of a less active form of OGA. Introducing Tax into HEK-293T cells or Tax-negative HTLV-1-transformed TL-om1 T cells is sufficient to inhibit OGA activity and increase total O-GlcNAcylation, without any change in OGT activity. Furthermore, Tax interacts with the OGT/OGA complex and inhibits the activity of OGT-bound OGA. Pharmacological inhibition of OGA increases CREB O-GlcNAcylation as well as HTLV-1-LTR transactivation by Tax and CREB recruitment to the LTR. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type CREB but not a CREB protein mutated on a previously described O-GlcNAcylation site enhances Tax-mediated LTR transactivation. Finally, both OGT and OGA are recruited to the LTR. These findings reveal the interplay between Tax and the O-GlcNAcylation pathway and identify new key molecular actors involved in the assembly of the Tax-dependent transactivation complex.","['Groussaud, Damien', 'Khair, Mostafa', 'Tollenaere, Armelle I', 'Waast, Laetitia', 'Kuo, Mei-Shiue', 'Mangeney, Marianne', 'Martella, Christophe', 'Fardini, Yann', 'Coste, Solene', 'Souidi, Mouloud', 'Benit, Laurence', 'Pique, Claudine', 'Issad, Tarik']","['Groussaud D', 'Khair M', 'Tollenaere AI', 'Waast L', 'Kuo MS', 'Mangeney M', 'Martella C', 'Fardini Y', 'Coste S', 'Souidi M', 'Benit L', 'Pique C', 'Issad T']","['INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170724,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (O-GlcNAc transferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.50 (hexosaminidase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/enzymology/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/metabolism/*virology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/07/26 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1006518 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-17-01305 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2017 Jul 24;13(7):e1006518. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006518. eCollection 2017 Jul.,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6555-0642', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6800-1777', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2845-8876', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9723-0245', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8690-2440']",PMC5542696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a recent study, a backbone cyclized analogue of gomesin was shown to be as active but more stable than its native form. In the current study, we were interested in improving the antimicrobial properties of the cyclic gomesin, understanding its selectivity toward melanoma cells and elucidating its antimicrobial and anticancer mode of action. Rationally designed analogues of cyclic gomesin were examined for their antimicrobial potency, selectivity toward cancer cells, membrane-binding affinity, and ability to disrupt cell and model membranes. We improved the activity of cyclic gomesin by approximately 10-fold against tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria without increasing toxicity to human red blood cells. In addition, we showed that gomesin and its analogues are more toxic toward melanoma and leukemia cells than toward red blood cells and act by selectively targeting and disrupting cancer cell membranes. Preference toward some cancer types is likely dependent on their different cell membrane properties. Our findings highlight the potential of peptides as antimicrobial and anticancer leads and the importance of selectively targeting cancer cell membranes for drug development.","['Troeira Henriques, Sonia', 'Lawrence, Nicole', 'Chaousis, Stephanie', 'Ravipati, Anjaneya S', 'Cheneval, Olivier', 'Benfield, Aurelie H', 'Elliott, Alysha G', 'Kavanagh, Angela Maria', 'Cooper, Matthew A', 'Chan, Lai Yue', 'Huang, Yen-Hua', 'Craik, David J']","['Troeira Henriques S', 'Lawrence N', 'Chaousis S', 'Ravipati AS', 'Cheneval O', 'Benfield AH', 'Elliott AG', 'Kavanagh AM', 'Cooper MA', 'Chan LY', 'Huang YH', 'Craik DJ']","['Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland , Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170808,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (gomesin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Bacteria/drug effects', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fungi/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lipid Bilayers/metabolism', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mycoses/drug therapy', 'Spiders/*chemistry']",,,2017/07/26 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.7b00459 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2017 Sep 15;12(9):2324-2334. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b00459.

Schrad is extensively used to treat diabetes, obesity, fever, cancer, amenorrhea, jaundice, leukemia, rheumatism, and respiratory diseases. Chemical studies have indicated the presence of several cucurbitacins, flavones, and other polyphenols in this plant. These phytochemical constituents are responsible for the interesting antioxidant and other biological activities of C. colocynthis. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, for the first time, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with partial least square (PLS) regression analysis was used to quantify the polyphenolic phytochemicals of C. colocynthis. METHODOLOGY: The fruit and aerial parts of the C. colocynthis were extracted individually in methanol followed by fractionation in n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water. Near infrared (NIR) spectra were obtained in absorption mode in the wavelength range 700-2500 nm. The PLS regression model was then built from the obtained spectral data to quantify the total polyphenol contents in the selected plant samples. RESULTS: The PLS regression model obtained had a R(2) value of 99% with a 0.98 correlationship value and a good prediction with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) value of 1.89% and correlation of 0.98. These results were further confirmed through UV-vis spectroscopy and it is found that the ethyl acetate fraction has the maximum value for polyphenol contents (101.7 mg/100 g; NIR, 100.4 mg/100 g; UV-vis). CONCLUSIONS: The polyphenolic phytochemicals of the fruit and aerial parts of C. colocynthis have been quantified successfully by using multivariate analysis in a non-destructive, economical, precise, and highly sensitive method, which uses very simple sample preparation.

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) or its close homolog EZH1 functions as a catalytic subunit of PRC2, so there are two PRC2 complexes containing either EZH2 or EZH1. Tumorigenic functions of EZH2 and its synthetic lethality with some subunits of SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes have been observed. However, little is known about the function of EZH1 in tumorigenesis. Herein, we developed novel, orally bioavailable EZH1/2 dual inhibitors that strongly and selectively inhibited methyltransferase activity of both EZH2 and EZH1. EZH1/2 dual inhibitors suppressed trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 in cells more than EZH2 selective inhibitors. They also showed greater antitumor efficacy than EZH2 selective inhibitor in vitro and in vivo against diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells harboring gain-of-function mutation in EZH2. A hematological cancer panel assay indicated that EZH1/2 dual inhibitor has efficacy against some lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and leukemia with fusion genes such as MLL-AF9, MLL-AF4, and AML1-ETO. A solid cancer panel assay demonstrated that some cancer cell lines are sensitive to EZH1/2 dual inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. No clear correlation was detected between sensitivity to EZH1/2 dual inhibitor and SWI/SNF mutations, with a few exceptions. Severe toxicity was not seen in rats treated with EZH1/2 dual inhibitor for 14 days at drug levels higher than those used in the antitumor study.

Such deregulation is frequently caused by alterations in the genes involved in the signaling pathway. At the end of 2013, recurrent somatic mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene that encodes a molecular chaperone were identified in a subset of patients with Philadelphia-chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The present review focuses on the role of CALR mutations in the oncogenic transformations observed in MPN. All the CALR mutations were found to generate a + 1 frameshift in the reading frame on exon 9, which encodes the carboxy (C)-terminus end of CALR, and thus conferred a common mutant-specific sequence in all the CALR mutants. The mutant CALR (but not the wild-type) constitutively activates the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL), even in the absence of TPO to induce cellular transformation. Preferential interaction between the mutant CALR and MPL is achieved by a presumptive conformational change induced by the mutant-specific C-terminus domain, which allows N-domain binding to MPL. Even though mutant CALR is expressed on the cell surface and is secreted out of cells, it only presents autocrine capacity for MPL activation. These findings define a novel molecular mechanism by which the mutant molecular chaperone constitutively activates the cytokine receptor to induce cellular transformation.","['Araki, Marito', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Araki M', 'Komatsu N']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Stem Cell Regulation, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170808,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)']",IM,"['Autocrine Communication', 'Binding Sites', 'Calreticulin/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Autocrine', 'JAK2', 'calreticulin', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'thrombopoietin receptor']",2017/07/26 06:00,2017/10/06 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13327 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2017 Oct;108(10):1907-1912. doi: 10.1111/cas.13327.

These insights and understanding of how the B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 protein family governs apoptosis have galvanized the search for a new class of cancer drugs that target its pro-survival members by mimicking their natural antagonists, the BCL-2 homology (BH)3-only proteins. Successful initial clinical trials of the BH3 mimetic venetoclax/ABT-199, specific for BCL-2, have led to its recent licensing for refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and to multiple ongoing trials for other malignancies. Moreover, preclinical studies herald the potential of emerging BH3 mimetics targeting other BCL-2 pro-survival members, particularly myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)-1, for multiple cancer types. Thus, BH3 mimetics seem destined to become powerful new weapons in the arsenal against cancer. This review sketches the discovery of the BCL-2 family and its impact on cancer development and therapy; describes how interactions of family members trigger apoptosis; outlines the development of BH3 mimetic drugs; and discusses their potential to advance cancer therapy.","['Cory, Suzanne', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Colman, Peter M', 'Adams, Jerry M']","['Cory S', 'Roberts AW', 'Colman PM', 'Adams JM']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria 3052, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Records of children with ALL who were 2 to 14 years old at the time of RT and were treated at a single institution between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. Patients' height, weight, and body mass index were converted into z-scores using the Centers for Disease Control growth charts to normalize the values to number of standard deviations from the mean. These values were measured at the pre-RT clinic visit and subsequent yearly intervals. The z-scores of the growth indices were fitted into a generalizing estimating equations model and analyzed by various clinical factors. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients met the study criteria, including 32 boys and 16 girls. The median age at the time of RT was 7 years (range, 2-14 years). Patients were separated into 2 dose groups: 12 Gy (n = 30) and 18 Gy (n = 18). Median follow-up was 4.9 years (range, 3.0-11.8 years) and 6.0 years (range, 3.1-10.5 years) and the median pre-RT height z-scores were -0.55 (range, -2.2 to 1.4) and -0.85 (range, -3.1 to 0.8) for the 2 groups, respectively (P = .65). Patients who received 18 Gy had a significant difference in change in height compared with those who received 12 Gy, who were able to maintain normal growth during the first 3 years of follow-up. This did not appear to be sex-specific, and there was no difference in change in weight or body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 18 Gy, patients with ALL who received 12 Gy of cranial RT had less height impairment in the first 3 years post-RT, but further prospective studies are needed.","['Chen, Albert C', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Kamdar, Kala Y', 'Sonabend, Rona Y', 'Suzawa, Hilary S', 'Jo, Eunji', 'Paulino, Arnold C']","['Chen AC', 'Okcu MF', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Kamdar KY', 'Sonabend RY', 'Suzawa HS', 'Jo E', 'Paulino AC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Dan L.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia undergoing myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant at Duke University Medical Center between 1995 and 2012 were included. The primary endpoint was LFS. Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality, and the risk of pulmonary toxicity. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazards multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients were evaluated: 90 received TBI-based conditioning regimens and 116 received chemotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 36 months. For all patients, 2-year LFS and OS were 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29-43) and 39% (95% CI, 32-46), respectively. After adjusting for known prognostic factors using a multivariate analysis, TBI was associated with improved LFS (hazard ratio: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44-0.91) and OS (hazard ratio: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.91). There was no difference in nonrelapse mortality between cohorts, but pulmonary toxicity was significantly more common with TBI (2-year incidence 42% vs 12%, P < .001).

In this study, we showed that mutant NPM1 elevated autophagic activity and autophagic activation contributed to leukemic cell survival in vitro. Meanwhile, we also found high expression of promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) and its cytoplasmic dislocation in primary NPM1-mutated AML blasts and NPM1-mA positive OCI-AML3 cells. Mechanically, mutant NPM1 interacted with PML and mediated it delocalization as well as stabilization. Notably, NPM1-mA knockdown impaired autophagic activity, while induced expression of PML reversed this effect. Finally, we confirmed that PML modulated autophagic activity via AKT signal. These findings suggest that aberrant PML expression and autophagy are beneficial to the leukemic transformation driven by NPM1 mutations. This indicates an attractive therapeutic avenue for PML targeting and/or autophagy inhibition in the treatment of NPM1-mutated AML.","['Zou, Qin', 'Tan, Shi', 'Yang, Zailin', 'Zhan, Qian', 'Jin, Hongjun', 'Xian, Jingrong', 'Zhang, Shuaishuai', 'Yang, Liyuan', 'Wang, Lu', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Zou Q', 'Tan S', 'Yang Z', 'Zhan Q', 'Jin H', 'Xian J', 'Zhang S', 'Yang L', 'Wang L', 'Zhang L']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children, Chongqing, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170601,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT.', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*autophagy', '*cell survival', '*mutation', '*nucleophosmin 1', '*promyelocytic leukemia gene']",2017/07/26 06:00,2018/03/28 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.19439 [doi]', 'thnov07p2289 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2017 Jun 1;7(8):2289-2304. doi: 10.7150/thno.19439. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5505061,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its involvement in the regulation of phagocytosis, a cellular activity essential for innate immunity and physiological tissue turnover, is unclear. We report that PALLD is highly induced along with all-trans-retinoic acid-induced maturation of myeloid leukemia cells, to promote Ig- or complement-opsonized phagocytosis. PALLD mechanistically facilitates phagocytic receptor clustering by regulating actin polymerization and c-Src dynamic activation during particle binding and early phagosome formation. PALLD is also required at the nascent phagosome to recruit phosphatase oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, which regulates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and actin depolymerization to complete phagosome closure. Collectively, our results show a new function for PALLD as a crucial regulator of the early phase of phagocytosis by elaborating dynamic actin polymerization and depolymerization.","['Sun, Hai-Min', 'Chen, Xin-Lei', 'Chen, Xin-Jie', 'Liu, Jin', 'Ma, Lie', 'Wu, Hai-Yan', 'Huang, Qiu-Hua', 'Xi, Xiao-Dong', 'Yin, Tong', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Sun HM', 'Chen XL', 'Chen XJ', 'Liu J', 'Ma L', 'Wu HY', 'Huang QH', 'Xi XD', 'Yin T', 'Zhu J', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China sjchen@stn.sh.cn zchen@stn.sh.cn zhujiang@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China sjchen@stn.sh.cn zchen@stn.sh.cn zhujiang@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China sjchen@stn.sh.cn zchen@stn.sh.cn zhujiang@shsmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170724,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (PALLD protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.36 (phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome/*immunology', '*Phagocytosis', 'Phagosomes/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Polymerization', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",,,2017/07/26 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1602018 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1602018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Sep 1;199(5):1817-1826. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1602018.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-tumor effects of Z-360 and/or gemcitabine were monitored using a MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model. The effect of Z-360 on apoptosis in the model was examined by TUNEL staining and real-time PCR analysis and the effect in MIA PaCa-2 cells stably expressing human CCK2R was also evaluated by caspase-3/7 activity. RESULTS: In this xenograft model, Z-360 significantly reduced the tumor weight, increased TUNEL-positive cells and suppressed the expression of anti-apoptosis factors such as survivin, XIAP and Mcl-1, and these effects of Z-360 combined with gemcitabine were more effective. Furthermore, gastrin-17 and gastrin-34 inhibited apoptosis in vitro and Z-360 dose-dependently abrogated this effect. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Z-360 exerts an anti-tumor effect through a reduction in anti-apoptosis factors by blocking CCK2R.","['Shiomi, Yoshihiro', 'Yoshimura, Makoto', 'Kuki, Kazumasa', 'Hori, Yuko', 'Tanaka, Takao']","['Shiomi Y', 'Yoshimura M', 'Kuki K', 'Hori Y', 'Tanaka T']","['Central Research Laboratories, ZERIA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kumagaya, Japan yoshihiro-shiomi@zeria.co.jp.', 'Central Research Laboratories, ZERIA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kumagaya, Japan.', 'Central Research Laboratories, ZERIA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kumagaya, Japan.', 'Central Research Laboratories, ZERIA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kumagaya, Japan.', 'Central Research Laboratories, ZERIA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kumagaya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (Gastrins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptor, Cholecystokinin B)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (Z-360)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '60748-06-3 (gastrin 17)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (gastrinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzodiazepinones/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Endopeptidases/administration & dosage', 'Gastrins/administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Receptor, Cholecystokinin B/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Survivin', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/biosynthesis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MiaPaCa-2', '*Pancreatic cancer', '*Z-360', '*apoptosis', '*cholecystokinin-2 receptor', '*gastrin', '*gemcitabine', '*xenograft']",2017/07/26 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['37/8/4127 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11800 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Aug;37(8):4127-4137. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11800.,,"['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limitations associated with existing agents increase the need to develop more effective anticancer drugs to improve the therapeutic arsenal available. The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the antiproliferative effects of three new thiazacridine derivatives. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a three steps synthesis reaction, three novel thiazacridine derivatives were obtained and characterized: (Z)-5-acridin-9-ylmethylene-3-(4-methyl-benzyl)-4-thioxo-thiazolidin- 2-one (LPSF/AC-99), (Z)-5-acridin-9-ylmethylene-3-(4-chloro-benzyl)-4-thioxo-thiazolidin-2- one (LPSF/AC-119) and (Z)-5-acridin-9-ylmethylene-3-(3-chloro-benzyl)-4-thioxo-thiazolidin-2- one (LPSF/AC-129). Toxicity and selectivity assays were performed by colorimetric assay. Then, changes in cell cycle and cell death induction mechanisms were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: All compounds exhibited cytotoxicity to Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma) and Jurkat (acute T cell leukemia) cells, where LPSF/AC-119 showed best IC50 values (0.6 and 1.53 micro M, respectively). LPSF/AC-129 was the only cytotoxic compound in glioblastoma cell line NG97 (IC50 = 55.77 micro M). None of the compounds were toxic to normal human cells and induced neoplastic cell death primarily by apoptosis. CONCLUSION: All derivatives were more cytotoxic to hematopoietic neoplastic cells when compared to solid tumor derived cells. All three compounds are promising for in vivo and combination therapy studies against cancer.","['de Melo Rego, Moacyr J B', 'de Sena, Wanessa L B', 'de Moura, Ricardo O', 'Jacob, Iris T T', 'Lins E Lins, Thiago U', 'Pereira, Michelly C', 'do Carmo A Lima, Maria', 'Galdino-Pitta, Marina R', 'da R Pitta, Ivan', 'da Rocha Pitta, Maira G']","['de Melo Rego MJB', 'de Sena WLB', 'de Moura RO', 'Jacob ITT', 'Lins E Lins TU', 'Pereira MC', 'do Carmo A Lima M', 'Galdino-Pitta MR', 'da R Pitta I', 'da Rocha Pitta MG']","['Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Recife, Brazil.', 'Biological Sciences Center, State University of Paraiba, Laboratory of Synthesis and Vectorization of Molecules, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Laboratory of Synthesis and Planning of Drug (LPSF), Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Laboratory of Synthesis and Planning of Drug (LPSF), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Design and Drug Synthesis (LPSF), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Bioscience Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Design and Drug Synthesis (LPSF), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Bioscience Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Pernambuco, Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Recife, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,9810948,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acridines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*acridine', '*apoptosis', '*cytotoxicity', '*hematopoietic neoplastic cells', '*therapeutic innovation']",2017/07/26 06:00,2018/12/13 06:00,['2017/07/26 06:00'],"['2017/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCHTS-EPUB-84938 [pii]', '10.2174/1386207320666170724114802 [doi]']",ppublish,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2017;20(8):713-718. doi: 10.2174/1386207320666170724114802.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, all developmental pathways are highly conserved cell signalling systems present in almost all multicellular organisms. In addition, they have a crucial role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and finally in organ development. Of note, almost all of these pathways promote oncogenesis through synergistic associations with the Hippo signalling pathway, and several lines of evidence have also indicated that these pathways (e.g., Wnt/beta-catenin) may be implicated in checkpoint inhibitor resistance (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1). Since Notch inhibition in vivo results in partial loss of its stemness features such as self-renewal, chemoresistance, invasive and migratory potential, and tumorigenesis, these highly conserved developmental pathways are regarded as being critical for regulation of self-renewal in both embryonic and adult stem cells and hence are likely to be implicated in the maintenance of cancer stem cells. Many small molecules are currently in preclinical and early clinical development, and only two compounds are approved for treatment of advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (vismodegib and sonidegib). Furthermore, therapeutic targeting of cancer stem cells using drugs that disrupt activated developmental pathways may also represent an attractive strategy that is potentially relevant to many types of malignancy, notably blood cancers, where the evidence for leukaemia stem cells is well established. Future work will hopefully pave the way for the development of new strategies for targeting these pervasive oncogenic pathways.","['Dempke, Wolfram C M', 'Fenchel, Klaus', 'Uciechowski, Peter', 'Chevassut, Timothy']","['Dempke WCM', 'Fenchel K', 'Uciechowski P', 'Chevassut T']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170722,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/trends', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer treatment', 'Developmental pathways', 'Novel targets']",2017/07/25 06:00,2018/01/16 06:00,['2017/07/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['000478703 [pii]', '10.1159/000478703 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2017;93(4):213-223. doi: 10.1159/000478703.

The aim of this study was to identify maternal and birth characteristics associated with early-age acute leukemia (EAL) in Brazil. METHODS: A case-cohort study was performed using secondary dataset information of PBCR and SINASC. The risk association variables were grouped into (i) characteristics of the child at birth and (ii) characteristics of maternal exposure during pregnancy. The case-control ratio was 1:4. Linkage was performed using R software; odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: EAL was associated with maternal occupational exposure to chemicals (agricultural, chemical, and petrochemical industry; adjOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.16-4.10) and with birth defects (adjOR: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.19-11.00). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study, with the identification of EAL risk factors in population-based case-cohort study, strengthen the knowledge and improve databases, contributing to investigations on risk factors associated with childhood leukemia worldwide.","['Reis, Rejane de Souza', 'Silva, Neimar de Paula', 'Santos, Marceli de Oliveira', 'Oliveira, Julio Fernando Pinto', 'Thuler, Luiz Claudio Santos', 'de Camargo, Beatriz', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Reis RS', 'Silva NP', 'Santos MO', 'Oliveira JFP', 'Thuler LCS', 'de Camargo B', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Coordenacao de Prevencao e Vigilancia, Divisao de Vigilancia e Analise de Situacao, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Centro de Pesquisa, Programa de Pesquisa Pediatrica em Hematologia e Oncologia, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Coordenacao de Prevencao e Vigilancia, Divisao de Vigilancia e Analise de Situacao, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Coordenacao de Prevencao e Vigilancia, Divisao de Vigilancia e Analise de Situacao, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Centro de Pesquisa, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Centro de Pesquisa, Programa de Pesquisa Pediatrica em Hematologia e Oncologia, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional do Cancer (INCA), Centro de Pesquisa, Programa de Pesquisa Pediatrica em Hematologia e Oncologia, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

However, the clinical significance and precise role of ZNF687 in cancer progression are largely unknown. Herein, we report that ZNF687 was markedly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and HCC tissues, and was significantly correlated with relapse-free survival in HCC. ZNF687 overexpression greatly enhanced HCC cell capability for tumorsphere formation, invasion and chemoresistance in vitro, whereas inhibiting ZNF687 reduced these capabilities and inhibited HCC cell tumorigenic capability in vivo. Importantly, extreme limiting dilution analysis revealed that even 1 x 10(2) ZNF687-transduced cells could form tumors in vivo, indicating that ZNF687 contributes to HCC recurrence.

A total of 348 adult patients were enrolled, including 127 HID, 144 MSD and 77 MUD recipients.

Previously, we demonstrated that treatment with 8-Cl-Ado leads to diminished ATP levels. We hypothesized that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling would be initiated in these cells, leading to induction of autophagy. AMPK activation and induction of autophagy were demonstrated during preclinical incubations in CLL cells with the analogues. Importantly, we extended similar observations in CLL lymphocytes during an 8-Cl-Ado phase-I trial.

Two hundred and twenty-two patients with AML treated with either induction chemotherapy or salvage chemotherapy between 2008 and 2013 were studied retrospectively. IFI was defined as per the revised EORTC-MSG criteria. Data on type of chemotherapy, prophylactic strategies, engraftment (ANC>500), the presence of IFI and survival were collected. IFI was diagnosed in 86 patients (38.7%) with proven IFI in 12 (5.4%). Use of posaconazole prophylaxis (P=.001) was the only factor associated with reduced incidence of IFI. Survival in patients with proven IFI was lower than those without proven IFI, but not statistically significant (59.4% vs 78.5%; P=.139). There is a high incidence of IFI during induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia in developing countries.

However, whether this fusion gene might be used as a reliable marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unknown METHODS: The clinical data of consecutive 29 patients with T-ALL who received allo-HSCT were collected. Their MRD were evaluated by SIL-TAL1, Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) expression, and the leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) . RESULTS: The median follow-up was 354 days (71-2111 days). Of the enrolled patients, 14 (87.5%) patients died of leukemia relapse. A total of 15 (51.7%) patients experienced relapse at a median of 90 days (60-540 days) after transplantation. The SIL-TAL1 expression of 16 patients converted from negative prior to transplantation to positive at 77 days (30-281 days) following transplantation; furthermore, 15 (93.8%) of them eventually experienced relapse. In the 15 relapsed patients, 13 (86.7%) had increased SIL-TAL1 expression levels 30 days (11-220 days) earlier than the hematological relapse and the detection of abnormal WT1 and LAIP. CONCLUSION: We are the first to demonstrate the reliability of the SIL-TAL1 fusion gene as a good MRD marker for patients with T-ALL after allo-HSCT.","['Zhao, X', 'Hong, Y', 'Qin, Y', 'Xu, Y', 'Chang, Y', 'Wang, Y', 'Zhang, X', 'Xu, L', 'Huang, X']","['Zhao X', 'Hong Y', 'Qin Y', 'Xu Y', 'Chang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Xu L', 'Huang X']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170724,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SIL-TAL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis']",['NOTNLM'],"['SIL-TAL1 fusion gene', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'minimal residual disease']",2017/07/25 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2017/07/25 06:00'],"['2017/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12711 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Dec;39(6):613-619. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12711.

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is an inflammatory cytokine that correlates with worse progression and symptomology in multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers. In canonical IFN-gamma-STAT1 signaling, IFN-gamma activates STAT1, a transcription factor, via phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 701 (p-STAT1). p-STAT1 then promotes transcription of IFN-gamma, creating a positive feedback loop. We previously found that calcitriol treatment of the TL-1 cell line, a model of T-LGLL, significantly decreased IFN-gamma secretion and p-STAT1 while increasing the vitamin D receptor (VDR) protein. Here we further explore these observations. Using TL-1 cells, IFN-gamma decreased starting at 4h following calcitriol treatment, with a reduction in the intracellular and secreted protein levels as well as the mRNA content. A similar reduction in IFN-gamma transcript levels was observed in primary T-LGLL patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). p-STAT1 inhibition followed a similar temporal pattern and VDR upregulation inversely correlated with IFN-gamma levels. Using EB1089 and 25(OH)D3, which have high or low affinity for VDR, respectively, we found that the decrease in IFN-gamma correlated with the ability of EB1089, but not 25(OH)D3, to upregulate VDR. However, both compounds inhibited p-STAT1; thus the reduction of p-STAT1 is not solely responsible for IFN-gamma inhibition. Conversely, cells treated with VDR siRNA exhibited decreased basal IFN-gamma production upon VDR knockdown in a dose-dependent manner. Calcitriol treatment upregulated VDR and decreased IFN-gamma regardless of initial VDR knockdown efficiency, strengthening the connection between VDR upregulation and IFN-gamma reduction. Our findings suggest multiple opportunities to further explore the clinical relevance of the vitamin D pathway and the potential role for vitamin D supplementation in T-LGLL.","['Kulling, Paige M', 'Olson, Kristine C', 'Olson, Thomas L', 'Hamele, Cait E', 'Carter, Kathryn N', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Kulling PM', 'Olson KC', 'Olson TL', 'Hamele CE', 'Carter KN', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 29908, USA.

A next-generation sequencing-based multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification variant (digitalMLPA) has been developed enabling simultaneous detection of copy number alterations (CNAs) of up to 1000 target sequences. This novel digitalMLPA assay was designed and optimized to detect CNAs of 56 key target genes and regions in ALL. A set of digital karyotyping probes has been included for the detection of gross ploidy changes, to determine the extent of CNAs, while also serving as reference probes for data normalization. Sixty-seven ALL patient samples (including B- and T-cell ALL), previously characterized for genetic aberrations by standard MLPA, array comparative genomic hybridization, and/or single-nucleotide polymorphism array, were analyzed single blinded using digitalMLPA. The digitalMLPA assay reliably identified whole chromosome losses and gains (including high hyperdiploidy), whole gene deletions or gains, intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21, fusion genes, and intragenic deletions, which were confirmed by other methods. Furthermore, subclonal alterations were reliably detected if present in at least 20% to 30% of neoplastic cells. The diagnostic sensitivity of the digitalMLPA assay was 98.9%, and the specificity was 97.8%. These results merit further consideration of digitalMLPA as a valuable alternative for genetic work-up of newly diagnosed ALL patients.","['Benard-Slagter, Anne', 'Zondervan, Ilse', 'de Groot, Karel', 'Ghazavi, Farzaneh', 'Sarhadi, Virinder', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Schwab, Claire', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Knuutila, Sakari', 'Schouten, Jan', 'Lammens, Tim', 'Savola, Suvi']","['Benard-Slagter A', 'Zondervan I', 'de Groot K', 'Ghazavi F', 'Sarhadi V', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'De Moerloose B', 'Schwab C', 'Vettenranta K', 'Harrison CJ', 'Knuutila S', 'Schouten J', 'Lammens T', 'Savola S']","['Department of Tumour Diagnostics, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Tumour Diagnostics, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Research and Development Department, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Faculty of Medicine, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Faculty of Medicine, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research and Development Department, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Tumour Diagnostics, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Research studies have identified multiple potential targets for therapy in FOP, and novel drug candidates are being developed for testing in clinical trials. A complementary approach seeks to identify approved drugs that could be re-purposed for off-label use against defined targets in FOP. One such drug is imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed for use in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib has the desirable effect of attacking multiple targets involved in the early hypoxic and inflammatory stages of FOP flare-ups, including HIF1-alpha, PDGFRalpha, c-KIT, and multiple MAP kinases. RESULTS: Based on compelling biologic rationale, strong preclinical data, and a favorable safety profile, imatinib has been prescribed on an off-label basis in a non-trial setting in seven children with continuous FOP flare-ups, predominantly in the axial regions, and which were not responsive to standard-of-care regimens. Anecdotal reports in these seven isolated cases document that the medication was well-tolerated with a ubiquitous reported decrease in the intensity of flare-ups in the six children who took the medication. CONCLUSIONS: These early clinical observations support the implementation of clinical trials in children with uncontrolled FOP flare-ups to determine if imatinib may ameliorate symptoms or alter the natural history of this debilitating and life-threatening disease.","['Kaplan, Frederick S', 'Andolina, Jeffrey R', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Teachey, David T', 'Finklestein, Jerry Z', 'Ebb, David H', 'Whitehead, Benjamin', 'Jacobs, Benjamin', 'Siegel, David M', 'Keen, Richard', 'Hsiao, Edward', 'Pignolo, Robert J']","['Kaplan FS', 'Andolina JR', 'Adamson PC', 'Teachey DT', 'Finklestein JZ', 'Ebb DH', 'Whitehead B', 'Jacobs B', 'Siegel DM', 'Keen R', 'Hsiao E', 'Pignolo RJ']","['Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Medicine, Center for Research in FOP & Related Disorders, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States.

To investigate the risk of complications and risk of re-exposing patients with asparaginase-associated pancreatitis to asparaginase, 18 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia trial groups merged data for this observational study. METHODS: Patient files from 26 trials run by 18 trial groups were reviewed on children (aged 1.0-17.9 years) diagnosed with t(9;22)-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia between June 1, 1996, and Jan 1, 2016, who within 50 days of asparaginase exposure developed asparaginase-associated pancreatitis. Asparaginase-associated pancreatitis was defined by at least two criteria: abdominal pain, pancreatic enzymes at least three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and imaging compatible with pancreatitis. Patients without sufficient data for diagnostic criteria were excluded. Primary outcomes were defined as acute and persisting complications of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis and risk of re-exposing patients who suffered an episode of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis to asparaginase. Data were collected from Feb 2, 2015, to June 30, 2016, and analysed and stored in a common database at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. FINDINGS: Of 465 patients with asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, 33 (8%) of 424 with available data needed mechanical ventilation, 109 (26%) of 422 developed pseudocysts, acute insulin therapy was needed in 81 (21%) of 393, and seven (2%) of 458 patients died. Risk of assisted mechanical ventilation, need for insulin, pseudocysts, or death was associated with older age (median age for patients with complications 10.5 years [IQR 6.4-13.8] vs without complications 6.1 years [IQR 3.6-12.2], p<0.0001), and having one or more affected vital signs (fever, hypotension, tachycardia, or tachypnoea; 96 [44%] of 217 patients with affected vital signs vs 11 [24%] of 46 patients without affected vital signs, p=0.02). 1 year after diagnosis of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, 31 (11%) of 275 patients still needed insulin or had recurrent abdominal pain or both. Both the risk of persisting need for insulin therapy and recurrent abdominal pain were associated with having had pseudocysts (odds ratio [OR] 9.48 [95% CI 3.01-35.49], p=0.0002 for insulin therapy; OR 11.79 [4.30-37.98], p<0.0001 for recurrent abdominal pain). Within 8 years of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, risk of abdominal symptoms dropped from 8% (26 of 312) to 0% (0 of 35) but the need for insulin therapy remained constant (9%, three of 35). 96 patients were re-exposed to asparaginase, including 59 after a severe asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (abdominal pain or pancreatic enzymes at least three times the ULN or both lasting longer than 72 h). 44 (46%) patients developed a second asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, 22 (52%) of 43 being severe. Risk of persisting need for insulin or abdominal pain after having had two versus one asparaginase-associated pancreatitis did not differ (three [7%] of 42 vs 28 [12%] of 233, p=0.51). Risk of a second asparaginase-associated pancreatitis was not associated with any baseline patient characteristics. INTERPRETATION: Since the risk of a second asparaginase-associated pancreatitis was not associated with severity of the first asparaginase-associated pancreatitis and a second asparaginase-associated pancreatitis did not involve an increased risk of complications, asparaginase re-exposure should be determined mainly by the anticipated need for asparaginase for antileukaemic efficacy. A study of the genetic risk factors identifying patients in whom asparaginase exposure should be restricted is needed.

The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of infectious complications, microbiology, and outcome in patients undergoing HSCT in Mexico during the pre-engraftment period and the impact on mortality rates at 12 months. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of all hematologic malignancies that received HSCT from January 2009 and December 2014, at an oncology reference center. RESULTS: We included 210 patients: 144 autologous (69%) and 66 allogeneic HSCT (31%). There were 184 infections documented in 109 patients; incidence rate was 47.2 per 1000 neutropenia/days and 22.4 per 1000 hospitalization/days. The main infections reported were pneumonia (n = 40, 19%), bloodstream infections (n = 36, 17.1%), and central line-associated bloodstream infections (n = 28, 13.3%). There were 110 bacteria isolated, 31 were multidrug-resistant (26 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase; Escherichia coli). There were 25 disseminated or complicated viral infections and 20 invasive fungal diseases. Fourteen patients died in the first 30 days (all related to the infectious process). In multivariate analysis leukemia, more than 2 chemotherapy regimens before transplant and pneumonia were related to 12-month mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Even though infectious processes are frequent in patients with HSCT, multidrug-resistant bacteria were not as frequent as supposed; however, when these microorganisms are involved, mortality rate is increased. It is important to be alert that patients with pneumonia have a significantly increased mortality risk in the first year.","['Cesar-Arce, A', 'Volkow-Fernandez, P', 'Valero-Saldana, L M', 'Acosta-Maldonado, B', 'Vilar-Compte, D', 'Cornejo-Juarez, P']","['Cesar-Arce A', 'Volkow-Fernandez P', 'Valero-Saldana LM', 'Acosta-Maldonado B', 'Vilar-Compte D', 'Cornejo-Juarez P']","['Department of Infectious Disease, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.

Cytochemical stains, which are enzymatic colorimetric reactions that occur in the cells of interest, were necessary to assign and confirm myeloid and lymphoid lineage. In the current WHO 2008 Classification of leukemia, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis have largely replaced cytochemical staining in the characterization of acute leukemias. Nonetheless, cytochemical testing remains a useful adjunct assay for the proper classification of acute leukemia in a number of diagnostic settings. This chapter reviews the principles of the most common cytochemical stains, their procedures and guides to interpretation, and results in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Paessler, Michele E', 'Helfrich, Marybeth', 'Wertheim, Gerald B W']","['Paessler ME', 'Helfrich M', 'Wertheim GBW']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. paessler@email.chop.edu.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. paessler@email.chop.edu."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Bone marrow', '*Cytochemical stains']",2017/07/25 06:00,2018/05/15 06:00,['2017/07/24 06:00'],"['2017/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-7142-8_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2017;1633:19-32. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7142-8_2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effective delivery of therapeutic agents to these cells requires an understanding of the dynamics of Siglec-8 surface expression. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether Siglec-8 is endocytosed in human eosinophils and malignant mast cells, identify mechanisms underlying its endocytosis, and demonstrate whether a toxin can be targeted to Siglec-8-bearing cells to kill these cells. METHODS: Siglec-8 surface dynamics were examined by flow cytometry using peripheral blood eosinophils, mast cell lines, and Siglec-8-transduced cells in the presence of inhibitors targeting components of endocytic pathways. Siglec-8 intracellular trafficking was followed by confocal microscopy. The ribosome-inhibiting protein saporin was conjugated to a Siglec-8-specific antibody to examine the targeting of an agent to these cells through Siglec-8 endocytosis. RESULTS: Siglec-8 endocytosis required actin rearrangement, tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C activities, and both clathrin and lipid rafts. Internalized Siglec-8 localized to the lysosomal compartment. Maximal endocytosis in Siglec-8-transduced HEK293T cells required an intact immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Siglec-8 was also shuttled to the surface via a distinct pathway. Sialidase treatment of eosinophils revealed that Siglec-8 is partially masked by sialylated cis ligands. Targeting saporin to Siglec-8 consistently caused extensive cell death in eosinophils and the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1.2. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic payloads can be targeted selectively to eosinophils and malignant mast cells by exploiting this Siglec-8 endocytic pathway.","[""O'Sullivan, Jeremy A"", 'Carroll, Daniela J', 'Cao, Yun', 'Salicru, Adriano N', 'Bochner, Bruce S']","[""O'Sullivan JA"", 'Carroll DJ', 'Cao Y', 'Salicru AN', 'Bochner BS']","['Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Ill.', 'Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Ill.', 'Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Ill.', 'Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Md.', 'Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Ill; Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Md.

Cats were challenged 3 weeks later with a virulent, heterologous FeLV isolate. FeLV antigenemia was determined at weekly intervals from 3 to 15 weeks postchallenge. Circulating proviral DNA was determined on terminal PBMC samples. Following challenge, persistent antigenemia developed in 15 (75%) placebo-vaccinated cats, 3 (15%) cats in the Versifel FeLV vaccinated group, and 1 cat (5%) each in the Purevax FeLV and the Nobivac FeLV vaccinated groups. The prevented fractions for three vaccine groups were 93%, 93%, and 80% respectively. The adjusted p-values for all vaccine group comparisons fail to approach statistical significance. There was excellent agreement between proviral FeLV DNA in circulating PBMCs and persistent antigenemia. It is shown that when cats are managed under the same conditions during a virulent challenge, via the normal route of infection, the tested vaccines all show a comparable degree of protection.","['Grosenbaugh, Deborah A', 'Frances-Duvert, Valerie', 'Abedi, Shabnam', 'Feilmeier, Bradley', 'Ru, Hongyu', 'Poulet, Herve']","['Grosenbaugh DA', 'Frances-Duvert V', 'Abedi S', 'Feilmeier B', 'Ru H', 'Poulet H']","['Merial, Research and Development, 1730 Olympic Dr., Athens, GA 30601, USA.

Ginsenoside Rb1 and Rd. have been reported to induce anaphylactoid reaction. In this study, the allergenicity of a series of 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) type ginsenosides, including Rb1, Rd., F2, Compound K and 20(S)-PPD, was evaluated in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL2H3) cells. As a result, 20(S)-PPD had no effect on the mast cell degranulation, but other components showed anaphylactoid potential to different extent. The allergenicity was stronger and stronger according to the order ""Rb1, Rd., F2, Compound K"". Then, F2 was further verified in RBL-2H3 cells, mouse peritoneal mast cells (MPMCs), Laboratory of Allergic Disease 2 (LAD2) human mast cells in vitro and mice in vivo. Results showed that F2 could induce a significant increase of histamine release and translocation of phosphatidylserine in RBL-2H3 cells. F2 also increased beta-hexosaminidase release and the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration of MPMCs and LAD2 cells. In addition, histamine level in serum of mice was elevated dose-dependently. Our study revealed the potential structure-allergenicity relationship of 20(S)-PPD type ginsenosides and first verified the allergenicity of ginsenoside F2.

Hospitalizations are an indicator of the burden of late effects. We identify rates and risk factors for hospitalization from five to ten years after diagnosis for childhood and adolescent ALL survivors compared to siblings and a matched population sample. METHODS: 176 ALL survivors were diagnosed at </=22 years between 1998 and 2008 and treated at an Intermountain Healthcare facility. The Utah Population Database identified siblings, an age- and sex-matched sample of the Utah population, and statewide inpatient hospital discharges. Sex- and birth year-adjusted Poisson models with Generalized Estimating Equations and robust standard errors calculated rates and rate ratios. Cox proportional hazards models identified demographic and clinical risk factors for hospitalizations among survivors. RESULTS: Hospitalization rates for survivors (Rate:3.76, 95% CI=2.22-6.36) were higher than siblings (Rate:2.69, 95% CI=1.01-7.18) and the population sample (Rate:1.87, 95% CI=1.13-3.09). Compared to siblings and population comparisons, rate ratios (RR) were significantly higher for survivors diagnosed between age 6 and 22 years (RR:2.87, 95% CI=1.03-7.97 vs siblings; RR:2.66, 95% CI=1.17-6.04 vs population comparisons). Rate ratios for diagnosis between 2004 and 2008 were significantly higher compared to the population sample (RR:4.29, 95% CI=1.49, 12.32), but not siblings (RR:2.73, 95% CI=0.54, 13.68). Survivors originally diagnosed with high-risk ALL did not have a significantly higher risk than siblings or population comparators. However, high-risk ALL survivors (Hazard ratio [HR]:3.36, 95% CI=1.33-8.45) and survivors diagnosed from 2004 to 2008 (HR:9.48, 95% CI=1.93-46.59) had the highest risk compared to their survivor counterparts.

Label retention experiments using doxycycline-inducible histone-2B (H2B)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice and several chase periods of up to 1 year quantified the adult pNSC cell cycle time as 3-5 months. We hypothesized that while pNSCs are not very proliferative at baseline, they may exist as a reserve pool of NSCs in case of injury. To test this function of pNSCs, we obtained conditional Oct4 knockout mice, Oct4(fl/fl) ;Sox1(Cre) (Oct4(CKO) ), which do not yield adult pNSC-derived neurospheres. When we ablated the progeny of pNSCs, namely all GFAP(+) dNSCs, in these Oct4(CKO) mice, we found that dNSCs did not recover as they do in wild-type mice, suggesting that pNSCs are necessary for dNSC repopulation. Returning to the H2B-GFP mice, we observed that the cytosine beta-d-arabinofuranoside ablation of proliferating cells including dNSCs-induced quiescent pNSCs to proliferate and significantly dilute their H2B-GFP label. In conclusion, we demonstrate that pNSCs are the most quiescent stem cells in the adult brain reported to date and that their lineage position upstream of GFAP(+) dNSCs allows them to repopulate a depleted neural lineage.

METHODS: This was a retrospective post hoc analysis of data from the GRAAL-LYSA LL03 trial, in which the treatment of LL using an adapted paediatric-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocol was evaluated. PET data acquired at baseline and after induction were analysed. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), total metabolic tumour volume and total lesion glycolysis were measured at baseline. The relative changes in SUVmax from baseline (DeltaSUVmax) and the Deauville score were determined after induction. RESULTS: The population analysed comprised 36 patients with T-type LL. SUVmax using a cut-off value of </=8.76 vs. >8.76 was predictive of 3-year event-free survival (31.6% vs. 80.4%; p = 0.013) and overall survival (35.0% vs. 83.7%; p = 0.028). DeltaSUVmax using a cut-off value of </=80% vs. >80% tended also to be predictive of 3-year event-free survival (40.0% vs. 76.0%; p = 0.054) and overall survival (49.2% vs. 85.6%; p = 0.085). Total metabolic tumour volume, baseline total lesion glycolysis and response according to the Deauville score were not predictive of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A low initial SUVmax was predictive of worse outcomes in our series of patients with T-type LL. Although relatively few patients were included, the study also suggested that DeltaSUVmax may be useful for predicting therapeutic efficacy.","['Becker, Stephanie', 'Vermeulin, Thomas', 'Cottereau, Anne-Segolene', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Vera, Pierre', 'Lepretre, Stephane']","['Becker S', 'Vermeulin T', 'Cottereau AS', 'Boissel N', 'Vera P', 'Lepretre S']","[""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Henri-Becquerel, Rue d'Amiens, 76038, Rouen Cedex, France. stephanie.becker@chb.unicancer.fr."", ""QuantIF-LITIS (EA [Equipe d'Accueil] 4108), Faculty of Medicine, University of Rouen, Rouen, France. stephanie.becker@chb.unicancer.fr."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hopital Tenon, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Universite Paris Diderot, EA3518, Paris, France.', ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Henri-Becquerel, Rue d'Amiens, 76038, Rouen Cedex, France."", ""QuantIF-LITIS (EA [Equipe d'Accueil] 4108), Faculty of Medicine, University of Rouen, Rouen, France."", 'Inserm U1245 and Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel and Normandie Univ UNIROUEN, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20170721,Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,['0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Burden', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['18F-FDG', 'Chemotherapy', 'Clinical trial', 'Lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'PET/CT', 'Prognostic factors']",2017/07/25 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/07/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00259-017-3776-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00259-017-3776-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2017 Nov;44(12):2034-2041. doi: 10.1007/s00259-017-3776-3.

We conducted a single-center survey to explore adherence and attitudes towards the recommended annual influenza vaccination. METHODS: Self-administered, standardized questionnaires were distributed to 143 staff members and 264 families. Items analyzed included demographic data, knowledge about influenza, history of prior influenza infections and vaccinations, routes of information and education, and attitudes towards the recommended influenza. Variables associated with vaccination were explored by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: One hundred six staff members with patient contact and 139 primary caretakers completed the questionnaire. Fifty-nine percent of staff members and 60% of the caretakers provided correct answers to all four knowledge questions; 32 and 54% reported a history of prior influenza, and 61 and 47% had received at least one influenza vaccination in the past. Vaccination rates for the previous season were 47, 34, 30, 25, and 29% in staff members, primary caretakers, their partners, diseased children, and their siblings, respectively. Main motivations (>75% in >/= 1 cohort) for vaccination were prevention of influenza disease and concerns to transmit it to others (77-100%) and reasons for not being immunized concerns of adverse effects and use of alternative protection (33-83%). Variables significantly associated with vaccination by multivariate analysis included receipt of influenza vaccinations in the past (OR 2.2-20.5), recommendations by health care providers (OR 4.8-45.5), a lower level of education (caretakers; OR 2.2), and younger age (children; OR 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey indicate insufficient vaccination rates and provide potential approaches for improved vaccination strategies in the setting of pediatric cancer care.","['Pettke, Aleksandra', 'Jocham, Sophie', 'Wiener, Andreas', 'Locken, Andreas', 'Groenefeld, Judith', 'Ahlmann, Martina', 'Groll, Andreas H']","['Pettke A', 'Jocham S', 'Wiener A', 'Locken A', 'Groenefeld J', 'Ahlmann M', 'Groll AH']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology - Clinical Virology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Munster, Germany."", ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Munster, Germany."", ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Munster, Germany."", ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Munster, Germany."", ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Munster, Germany."", ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Munster, Germany. grollan@ukmuenster.de.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170721,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Influenza Vaccines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Child', 'Female', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Influenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Influenza, Human/prevention & control/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*virology', 'Siblings', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vaccination/psychology/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adherence', '*Cancer', '*Caretakers', '*Children', '*Immunization rates', '*Influenza', '*Leukemia', '*Parents', '*Recommendations', '*Staff', '*Transplantation', '*Vaccination']",2017/07/25 06:00,2018/02/01 06:00,['2017/07/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-017-3813-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-017-3813-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2017 Dec;25(12):3815-3822. doi: 10.1007/s00520-017-3813-6.

Macrophage inflammatory responses are governed by gene expression patterns, and these patterns are often subject to epigenetic control. Chromatin modifications, such as histone methylation, regulate gene accessibility in macrophages, and macrophage polarization is governed in part by the expression and function of chromatin-modifying enzymes. The histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) preferentially modifies lysine residue 4 on the unstructured protein tail of histone H3. MLL1 expression and function have been shown to be governed by signal transduction pathways that are activated by inflammatory stimuli, such as NF-kappaB. Therefore, we sought to investigate the role of MLL1 in mediating macrophage inflammatory responses. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice with a targeted MLL1 gene knockout (Lys2-Cre(+/-) MLL1(fx/fx)) exhibited decreased proinflammatory gene expression with concurrent decreases in activating histone methylation. However, MLL1-deficient macrophages also exhibited increased phagocytic and bacterial killing activity in vitro. RNA profiling of MLL1-knockout macrophages identified numerous genes involved with inflammatory responses whose expression was altered in response to TLR ligands or proinflammatory cytokines, including STAT4. STAT4-dependent cytokines, such as type I IFNs were able to drive MLL1 expression in macrophages, and MLL1-knockout macrophages exhibited decreased activating histone methylation in the STAT4 promoter. These results implicate an important role for MLL1-dependent epigenetic regulation of macrophage antimicrobial functions.","['Carson, William F 4th', 'Cavassani, Karen A', 'Soares, Elyara M', 'Hirai, Soichiro', 'Kittan, Nicolai A', 'Schaller, Matthew A', 'Scola, Melissa M', 'Joshi, Amrita', 'Matsukawa, Akihiro', 'Aronoff, David M', 'Johnson, Craig N', 'Dou, Yali', 'Gallagher, Katherine A', 'Kunkel, Steven L']","['Carson WF 4th', 'Cavassani KA', 'Soares EM', 'Hirai S', 'Kittan NA', 'Schaller MA', 'Scola MM', 'Joshi A', 'Matsukawa A', 'Aronoff DM', 'Johnson CN', 'Dou Y', 'Gallagher KA', 'Kunkel SL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; slkunkel@umich.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; and.', 'DNA Sequencing and Microarray Core, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170721,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT4 Transcription Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteriolysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Infections/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'STAT4 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome']",,,2017/07/25 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2017/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1601272 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1601272 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Sep 1;199(5):1865-1874. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1601272.

Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3 + 3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, de-escalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determine how stringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transition for each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators.

Herein, we show that miR-99 regulates self-renewal in both HSCs and LSCs. miR-99 maintains HSC long-term reconstitution activity by inhibiting differentiation and cell cycle entry. Moreover, miR-99 inhibition induced LSC differentiation and depletion in an MLL-AF9-driven mouse model of AML, leading to reduction in leukemia-initiating activity and improved survival in secondary transplants. Confirming miR-99's role in established AML, miR-99 inhibition induced primary AML patient blasts to undergo differentiation. A forward genetic shRNA library screen revealed Hoxa1 as a critical mediator of miR-99 function in HSC maintenance, and this observation was independently confirmed in both HSCs and LSCs. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of noncoding RNAs in the regulation of HSC and LSC function and identify miR-99 as a critical regulator of stem cell self-renewal.","['Khalaj, Mona', 'Woolthuis, Carolien M', 'Hu, Wenhuo', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Chu, S Haihua', 'Qamar, Sarah', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Park, Christopher Y']","['Khalaj M', 'Woolthuis CM', 'Hu W', 'Durham BH', 'Chu SH', 'Qamar S', 'Armstrong SA', 'Park CY']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MIRN99 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Self Renewal/*genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,,2017/07/25 06:00,2017/07/25 06:01,['2017/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:01 [medline]', '2017/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20161595 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20161595 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2017 Aug 7;214(8):2453-2470. doi: 10.1084/jem.20161595.,['R01 CA164120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2017 Khalaj et al.'],,PMC5551568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have increased mitochondria compared with nonmalignant CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, contrary to the Warburg hypothesis, AML relies on oxidative phosphorylation to generate adenosine triphosphate. Here we report that in human AML, NOX2 generates superoxide, which stimulates bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) to AML blast transfer of mitochondria through AML-derived tunneling nanotubes. Moreover, inhibition of NOX2 was able to prevent mitochondrial transfer, increase AML apoptosis, and improve NSG AML mouse survival. Although mitochondrial transfer from BMSC to nonmalignant CD34(+) cells occurs in response to oxidative stress, NOX2 inhibition had no detectable effect on nonmalignant CD34(+) cell survival. Taken together, we identify tumor-specific dependence on NOX2-driven mitochondrial transfer as a novel therapeutic strategy in AML.","['Marlein, Christopher R', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Piddock, Rachel E', 'Robinson, Stephen D', 'Edwards, Dylan R', 'Shafat, Manar S', 'Zhou, Zhigang', 'Lawes, Matthew', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'Rushworth, Stuart A']","['Marlein CR', 'Zaitseva L', 'Piddock RE', 'Robinson SD', 'Edwards DR', 'Shafat MS', 'Zhou Z', 'Lawes M', 'Bowles KM', 'Rushworth SA']","['Norwich Medical School and.', 'Norwich Medical School and.', 'Norwich Medical School and.', 'School of Biological Sciences, The University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, United Kingdom; and.', 'Norwich Medical School and.', 'Norwich Medical School and.', 'Norwich Medical School and.', 'Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Norwich Medical School and.', 'Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Norwich Medical School and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170721,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (Cybb protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*pathology', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2017/07/25 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/07/23 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32813-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-03-772939 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Oct 5;130(14):1649-1660. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-03-772939.

MiR-181a was expected to have a role in the development of hematological malignancies; it might act as tumor suppressor or oncogene. Smad7 was selected as miR-181a target pair. It is a negative regulator for the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway. In this study, relative expression levels of miR-181a by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), both Smad 7 and TGF-beta1 proteins levels by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were all measured in serum of 60 child, 30 with ALL and 30 age and sex matched healthy child as control group. MiR-181a expression showed highly significant decrease; plus a significant increase and decrease of Smad7 and TGF-beta1 protein levels respectively, in serum samples of ALL as compared to control group. MiR-181a expression achieved a highly significant positive and a significant negative correlation with TGF-beta1 and Smad7 respectively. Furthermore, the levels of Smad7 and TGF-beta1 were negatively correlated with each other (p<0.05). Although, positivity rate of both Smad7 and TGF-beta1 in ALL group increased with presence of hepatosplenomegaly, still there was no statistical significance. In conclusion, miR-181a could act as a tumor suppressor in pediatric ALL with over expression of its target pair, Smad7. Smad7 regulates TGF-beta1 signaling via a negative feedback loop and mediates the interaction between TGF-beta1 and other signaling pathways; suggesting that Smad7 over expression may have therapeutic potential in ALL.","['Nabhan, Marwa', 'Louka, Manal L', 'Khairy, Eman', 'Tash, Fathy', 'Ali-Labib, Randa', 'El-Habashy, Safinaz']","['Nabhan M', 'Louka ML', 'Khairy E', 'Tash F', 'Ali-Labib R', 'El-Habashy S']","['Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Abbassia, Cairo, P.O.

Early recognition and diagnosis can have significant clinical implications, as skin manifestations may be the first indication of underlying hematologic malignancy, can reflect the immune status and stage of disease, and cutaneous reactions may occur from conventional and targeted agents used to treat myeloid disease. In addition, infections with cutaneous involvement are common in immunocompromised patients with myeloid disease. Given the varying presentations, dermatologic findings associated with myeloid malignancies can pose diagnostic challenges for hematologists and dermatologists.

To identify somatic mutations, it is necessary to have a control tissue from the same individual for comparison. When patients with leukemia achieve remission, the remission peripheral blood may be a suitable and easily accessible control tissue, but this approach has not previously been applied to the study of mtDNA mutations. We have developed and validated a next-generation sequencing approach for the identification of leukemia-associated mtDNA mutations in 26 chronic myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis using either nonhematopoietic or remission blood samples as the control. The entire mt genome was amplified by long-range PCR and sequenced using Illumina technology. Variant caller software was used to detect mtDNA somatic mutations, and an empirically determined threshold of 2% was applied to minimize false-positive results because of sequencing errors. Mutations were called against both nonhematopoietic and remission controls: the overall concordance between the two approaches was 81% (73/90 mutations). Some discordant results were because of the presence of somatic mutations in remission samples, because of either minimal residual disease or nonleukemic hematopoietic clones. This method could be applied to study somatic mtDNA mutations in leukemia patients who achieve minimal residual disease, and in patients with nonhematopoietic cancers who have a matched uninvolved tissue available.","['Pagani, Ilaria S', 'Kok, Chung H', 'Saunders, Verity A', 'Van der Hoek, Mark B', 'Heatley, Susan L', 'Schwarer, Anthony P', 'Hahn, Christopher N', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'White, Deborah L', 'Ross, David M']","['Pagani IS', 'Kok CH', 'Saunders VA', 'Van der Hoek MB', 'Heatley SL', 'Schwarer AP', 'Hahn CN', 'Hughes TP', 'White DL', 'Ross DM']","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Department of Haematology, Box Hill Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

We established NTBI and oxidative stress determinants (OSD), iron parameters, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, liver tests, cumulative chemotherapeutic doses, and transfused blood in 36 children with acute leukemia throughout chemotherapy. These parameters were determined at the beginning and end of chemotherapy blocks (11 time points) and in 20 healthy children using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and colorimetric and fluorometric enzymatic methods. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, NTBI, OSD, and hs-CRP were higher than controls at 4/11, 7/11, and 9/11 time points (P<0.05). At 3 time points, NTBI and OSD concurrently increased. Ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, serum iron, and transferrin saturation were higher than in controls at 5 to 11/11 time points (P<0.05). Those with NTBI had higher iron parameters than those without NTBI (P<0.05), but showed similar OSD, hs-CRP, liver enzymes, cumulative chemotherapeutics, and transfused blood (P>0.05). OSD did not correlate with NTBI, but correlated with hs-CRP. In conclusion, NTBI is a poor predictor of OSD in acute leukemia possibly because of the heterogeneity of NTBI and chronic inflammation. Further studies are needed to delineate the pathophysiology of these diseases.","['Olcay, Lale', 'Serteser, Mustafa', 'Kolay, Murat', 'Balci, Havva F', 'Yildirim, Ulku M', 'Tekgunduz, Sibel A', 'Hazirolan, Tuncay', 'Terzi, Yunus K']","['Olcay L', 'Serteser M', 'Kolay M', 'Balci HF', 'Yildirim UM', 'Tekgunduz SA', 'Hazirolan T', 'Terzi YK']","[""*Unit of Pediatric Hematology, A.Y.

Attempts to use health administrative data to identify these events have focused on older adults and have been mostly unsuccessful. We developed and tested administrative data-based algorithms in a population-based cohort of adolescents and young adults with cancer. METHODS: We identified all Ontario adolescents and young adults 15-21 years old diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, or testicular cancer between 1992-2012. Chart abstraction determined the end of initial treatment (EOIT) date and subsequent cancer-related events (progression, relapse, second cancer). Linkage to population-based administrative databases identified fee and procedure codes indicating cancer treatment or palliative care. Algorithms determining EOIT based on a time interval free of treatment-associated codes, and new cancer-related events based on billing codes, were compared with chart-abstracted data. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 1404 patients. Time periods free of treatment-associated codes did not validly identify EOIT dates; using subsequent codes to identify new cancer events was thus associated with low sensitivity (56.2%). However, using administrative data codes that occurred after the EOIT date based on chart abstraction, the first cancer-related event was identified with excellent validity (sensitivity, 87.0%; specificity, 93.3%; positive predictive value, 81.5%; negative predictive value, 95.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Although administrative data alone did not validly identify cancer-related events, administrative data in combination with chart collected EOIT dates was associated with excellent validity. The collection of EOIT dates by cancer registries would significantly expand the potential of administrative data linkage to assess cancer outcomes.","['Gupta, Sumit', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Baxter, Nancy N', 'Lau, Cindy', 'Daly, Corinne', 'Pole, Jason D']","['Gupta S', 'Nathan PC', 'Baxter NN', 'Lau C', 'Daly C', 'Pole JD']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto.', ""Department of General Surgery, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute St. Michael's Hospital."", 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.', 'Canadian Partnership Against Cancer.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual/*standards', 'Electronic Health Records/*standards', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Ontario', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/07/22 06:00,2019/02/07 06:00,['2017/07/22 06:00'],"['2017/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MLR.0000000000000777 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Care. 2018 Jun;56(6):e32-e38. doi: 10.1097/MLR.0000000000000777.,"['MOP 133618/CIHR/Canada', 'FND 148470/CIHR/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we determined the frequency of occurrence of fish-shaped RBC in different haematologic diseases. METHODS: We examined PB smears of patients with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (n=23), beta-thalassaemia minor (BTM) (n=30), sickle cell disease (SCD) (n=7), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) (n=13), microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) (n=11), hereditary sphaerocytosis (HS) (n=4), hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) (n=3), vitamin B12 and folate deficiency (n=15), anaemia in liver disease (LD) (n=17), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n=15), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n=29), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) (n=18), primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (n=12), chronic myelo-monocytic leukaemia (CMML) (n=15) and 21 healthy controls by light microscopy for the occurrence of fish-shaped erythrocytes. The fish-shaped RBC were counted as cells per 20 high-power fields (HPF) at 1000-fold magnification, and slides containing >/=1 fish-shaped RBC/20 HPF were regarded as positive. RESULTS: Fish-shaped RBC were significantly found in HE, iron deficiency, vitamin B12/folate deficiency, LD and PMF. The highest numbers of fish-shaped RBC were seen in HE and vitamin B12/folate deficiency. In patients with BTM, MDS, AML and CMML, this RBC anomaly was only occasionally observed. Furthermore, a statistically significant negative correlation of haemoglobin with the occurrence of fish-shaped RBC was apparent (p<0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the occurrence of fish-shaped RBC is suggestive of a pathologic condition, especially IDA, HE, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, primary mylofibrosis or LD, and is significantly associated with severity of anaemia.","['Robier, Christoph', 'Korber, Carolin', 'Quehenberger, Franz', 'Neubauer, Manfred', 'Wolfler, Albert']","['Robier C', 'Korber C', 'Quehenberger F', 'Neubauer M', 'Wolfler A']","['Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics, Hospital of the Brothers of St. John of God, Bergstr. 27, 8020 Graz, Austria, Phone: +43 316 5989 26671, Fax: +43 316 5989 21505.', 'Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of the Brothers of St. John of God, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocyte Count', '*Erythrocytes, Abnormal/classification', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*blood/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*erythrocytes', '*fish cells', '*fish-shaped erythrocytes', '*poikilocytes', '*red blood cell morphology']",2017/07/22 06:00,2019/02/14 06:00,['2017/07/22 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/cclm-2017-0378 [doi]', 'cclm-2017-0378 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2018 Jan 26;56(2):323-326. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2017-0378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WNT/beta-catenin signaling cascade crosstalks with RTK/SRK and GPCR-cAMP-PKA signaling cascades to regulate beta-catenin phosphorylation and beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Germline mutations in WNT signaling molecules cause hereditary colorectal cancer, bone diseases, exudative vitreoretinopathy, intellectual disability syndrome and PCP-related diseases. APC or CTNNB1 mutations in colorectal, endometrial and prostate cancers activate the WNT/beta-catenin signaling cascade. RNF43, ZNRF3, RSPO2 or RSPO3 alterations in breast, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and other cancers activate the WNT/beta-catenin, WNT/STOP and other WNT signaling cascades. ROR1 upregulation in B-cell leukemia and solid tumors and ROR2 upregulation in melanoma induce invasion, metastasis and therapeutic resistance through Rho-ROCK, Rac-JNK, PI3K-AKT and YAP signaling activation. WNT signaling in cancer, stromal and immune cells dynamically orchestrate immune evasion and antitumor immunity in a cell context-dependent manner. Porcupine (PORCN), RSPO3, WNT2B, FZD5, FZD10, ROR1, tankyrase and beta-catenin are targets of anti-WNT signaling therapy, and ETC-159, LGK974, OMP-18R5 (vantictumab), OMP-54F28 (ipafricept), OMP-131R10 (rosmantuzumab), PRI-724 and UC-961 (cirmtuzumab) are in clinical trials for cancer patients. Different classes of anti-WNT signaling therapeutics are necessary for the treatment of APC/CTNNB1-, RNF43/ZNRF3/RSPO2/RSPO3- and ROR1-types of human cancers. By contrast, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), SOST and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) are targets of pro-WNT signaling therapy, and anti-DKK1 (BHQ880 and DKN-01) and anti-SOST (blosozumab, BPS804 and romosozumab) monoclonal antibodies are being tested in clinical trials for cancer patients and osteoporotic post-menopausal women. WNT-targeting therapeutics have also been applied as reagents for in vitro stem-cell processing in the field of regenerative medicine.","['Katoh, Masuko', 'Katoh, Masaru']","['Katoh M', 'Katoh M']","['M&M Medical BioInformatics, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Omics Network, National Cancer Center, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170719,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis/genetics/metabolism/therapy', '*Endometrial Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Intellectual Disability/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics']",,,2017/07/22 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2017/07/22 06:00'],"['2017/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2017.3071 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2017 Sep;40(3):587-606. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2017.3071.

The chondrocytes were isolated, cultured, and then subjected to mechanical stretch force for 0, 2, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The expression levels of Piezo1 and the apoptosis-related protein caspase-12 were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, as well as the apoptosis-related genes, B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was used to discern dead cells. Piezo1 expression was determined by immunofluorescence. In addition, Piezo1 inhibitor, GsMTx4, was used to block the mechanically activated (MA) cation channel Piezo1, and served as a positive control. The results showed that the osteoarthritis (OA)-derived chondrocytes showed a tendency to undergo late-stage apoptosis under compressive loading. Piezo1 and caspase-12 were significantly upregulated under static compressive stimuli and the expression was related to the rate of apoptosis of the OA-derived chondrocytes during compressive loading. The expression of caspase-12 and late-stage apoptosis of the human OA-derived chondrocytes were repressed by GsMTx4, the specific inhibitor of Piezo1, while the expression of Piezo1 and the induction of the apoptosis of the OA-derived chondrocytes during compressive loading was not totally blocked. Thus, we conclude that Piezo1 plays an important role in the apoptosis of human OA-derived chondrocytes through a caspase-12-dependent pathway. The expression of Piezo1 protein was not totally inhibited by GsMTx4.","['Li, Xiao-Fei', 'Zhang, Zhao', 'Chen, Zhu-Ke', 'Cui, Zhao-Wei', 'Zhang, Hai-Ning']","['Li XF', 'Zhang Z', 'Chen ZK', 'Cui ZW', 'Zhang HN']","['Department of Joint Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266101, P.R.

In order to explore the association between DLBCL and TET mutations, the present study analyzed the gene expression and methylation profiles in human DLBCL biopsy tissues with wildtype and mutated TET2. The microarray dataset GSE37365, containing two subseries: the genomewide gene expression dataset GSE37362 and the DNA methylation microarray dataset GSE37363, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package of R. Furthermore, differentially methylated sites and differentially methylated regions were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed via GO stats and GSEABase packages respectively. Finally, the Pathview package was used to construct the network of enriched pathways. A total of 198 DEGs (106 up and 92 downregulated) were obtained. A total of 602 shared differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified according to differentially methylated levels. A total of 12 overlapping genes were identified in DEGs and DMGs. It was observed that 9 of the 12 overlapped genes were downregulated and hypermethylated, with 24 GO terms and one KEGG pathway significantly enriched. The results of the present study demonstrated that the genes cryptochrome circadian clock 1, zinc finger protein (ZNF) interacting with K protein 1, ZNF134, ZNF256 and ZNF615, which were hypermethylated and downregulated in DLBCL patients with TET2 mutations, were the key genes in the association between DLBCL and TET mutations.

In this work, we studied the effects of the inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor FF-10501 on erythropoiesis of human hematopoietic cells. Differentiation of K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells to an erythroid lineage was promoted by FF-10501 in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that metabolic conversion of IMP to hypoxanthine leads to elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The differentiative effects of FF-10501 were abolished by the ROS scavenger dimethylthiourea or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Furthermore, FF-10501 promoted erythropoiesis from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, accompanied with ROS accumulation, while high-dose FF-10501 mainly showed cytotoxic effects.

Notably, DNMT3B alone contains nearly 40 different splice variants. In this study, we have identified a novel splice variant of DNMT3B, which lacks exon 7 and 10 from leukemic cell lines which we termed as DNMT3B9. The exon 7 codes for the major part of PWWP domain, and exon 10 inclusion serves as a pluripotent marker. By quantitative RT-PCR using exon-exon junction-specific primers, we showed higher level of DNMT3B9 transcripts in several leukemic cell lines. However, DNMT3B9 expression was less in other tested cancer cell lines indicating that DNMT3B9 might serve as a leukemic-specific biomarker. Surprisingly, endogenous protein for DNMT3B9 was not detected in leukemic cells suggesting the unidentified RNA-related function(s) for DNMT3B9. In addition, we showed that DNMT3B9 protein lacks PWWP domain is less stable compared to other DNMT3B variants which contain PWWP domain through computational predictions and by cycloheximide half-life experiment. Taken together, we demonstrated the existence of novel leukemic-specific splice variant of DNMT3B and provide the evidence for the role of PWWP domain in the stability of DNMT3B. The findings reported here have relevance in epigenetic therapy, which is aimed to target the DNMT3B in cancer cells.","['Singh, Prachi', 'Sailu, Sarvagalla', 'Palchamy, Elango', 'Coumar, Mohane Selvaraj', 'Baluchamy, Sudhakar']","['Singh P', 'Sailu S', 'Palchamy E', 'Coumar MS', 'Baluchamy S']","['Department of Biotechnology, Pondicherry Central University, Pondicherry, 605014, India.', 'Centre for Bioinformatics, Pondicherry Central University, Pondicherry, 605014, India.', 'Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute On Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Centre for Bioinformatics, Pondicherry Central University, Pondicherry, 605014, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Pondicherry Central University, Pondicherry, 605014, India. sudhakar.dbt@pondiuni.edu.in.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170720,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', '*Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['Alternative splicing', 'DNA methylation', 'DNMT3B', 'Leukemia', 'PWWP domain', 'Protein stability']",2017/07/22 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2017/07/22 06:00'],"['2017/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-017-1008-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-017-1008-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2017 Aug;34(8):145. doi: 10.1007/s12032-017-1008-0.

Aberrant DNA methylation occurs commonly in cancer cells. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a specific chromosomal lesion the BCR-ABL translocation t(9:22), in establishing DNA methylation profiles in cancer. Materials and methods We compared DNA methylation of 1,505 selected promoter CpGs in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with and without the Philadelphia chromosome t(9:22), CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transfected with BCR-ABL, and other tumors without BCR-ABL (acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In this study, the DNA methylation profile of CML was more closely related to APL, another myeloid leukemia, than Ph+ ALL. Although DNA methylation profiles were consistent within a specific tumor type, overall DNA methylation profiles were no influenced by BCR-ABL gene translocation in the cancers and tissues studied. We conclude that DNA methylation profiles may reflect the cell of origin in cancers rather than the chromosomal lesions involved in leukemogenesis.","['Byun, Hyang-Min', 'Eshaghian, Shahrooz', 'Douer, Dan', 'Trent, Jonathen', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Siegmund, Kim', 'Yang, Allen S']","['Byun HM', 'Eshaghian S', 'Douer D', 'Trent J', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Bhatia R', 'Siegmund K', 'Yang AS']","['Human Nutrition Research Centre, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5PLUnited Kingdom.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Sarcoma, University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170504,Poland,Open Med (Wars),"Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)",101672167,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia', 'Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia', 'DNA methylation', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",2017/07/22 06:00,2017/07/22 06:01,['2017/07/22 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/med-2017-0014 [doi]', 'med-2017-0014 [pii]']",epublish,Open Med (Wars). 2017 May 4;12:76-85. doi: 10.1515/med-2017-0014. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5444343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several mutations of SHP-2 have been found in children with myeloproliferative disorders or malignant leukemia, and some of these can affect brain development. In the present study, we aimed to identify and functionally characterize genetic variations in SHP-2 in 72 preterm and 58 full-term infants and to evaluate the effect of the variations on neurodevelopment in preterm infants. Twelve genetic variations were identified. Among them, two variations in the SHP-2 promoter, g.-317C > T and g.-273G > A, were found to significantly increase promoter activity, and the frequency of g.-273G > A was higher in preterm infants than in full-term infants. Two transcription factors, NF-kappaB and GABPalpha, were found to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of SHP-2 by the two above-mentioned variations. In particular, we found that g.-273G > A was significantly associated with delayed myelination and poor motor development in preterm infants. Our results suggest that a functional promoter variation in SHP-2 is associated with spontaneous preterm birth itself as well as white matter myelination and neurodevelopment.","['Shim, So-Yeon', 'Jeong, Hye Jin', 'Park, Hyo Jin', 'Kwon, Eun Young', 'Kim, Bo Min', 'Choi, Yang Ji', 'Choi, Youn-Hee', 'Cho, Su Jin', 'Choi, Ji Ha', 'Park, Eun Ae']","['Shim SY', 'Jeong HJ', 'Park HJ', 'Kwon EY', 'Kim BM', 'Choi YJ', 'Choi YH', 'Cho SJ', 'Choi JH', 'Park EA']","['Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Neuroscience Research Institute, Gachon University, Incheon, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tissue Injury Defense Research Center, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tissue Injury Defense Research Center, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tissue Injury Defense Research Center, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tissue Injury Defense Research Center, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, Tissue Injury Defense Research Center, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tissue Injury Defense Research Center, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea. jihachoi@ewha.ac.kr.', 'Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea. pea8639@ewha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170720,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Developmental Disabilities/genetics/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', '*Infant, Premature', 'Male', '*Motor Activity', 'Myelin Sheath/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,,2017/07/22 06:00,2019/01/30 06:00,['2017/07/22 06:00'],"['2017/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-06401-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-06401-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jul 20;7(1):6052. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-06401-x.,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3765-8546', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1685-4276']",PMC5519743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These subgroups are defined by their superenhancer (SE) maps, orthogonal to somatic mutations, and are associated with distinct leukemic cell states. Examination of transcriptional drivers for these epigenomic subtypes uncovers a subset of patients with a particularly strong SE at the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene locus. The presence of a RARA SE and concomitant high levels of RARA mRNA predisposes cell lines and ex vivo models to exquisite sensitivity to a selective agonist of RARalpha, SY-1425 (tamibarotene). Furthermore, only AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with high RARA mRNA were found to respond to SY-1425. Mechanistically, we show that the response to SY-1425 in RARA-high AML cells is similar to that of acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with retinoids, characterized by the induction of known retinoic acid response genes, increased differentiation, and loss of proliferation.Significance: We use the SE landscape of primary human AML to elucidate transcriptional circuitry and identify novel cancer vulnerabilities. A subset of patients were found to have an SE at RARA, which is predictive for response to SY-1425, a potent and selective RARalpha agonist, in preclinical models, forming the rationale for its clinical investigation in biomarker-selected patients.

We investigated vosaroxin with decitabine in patients >/=60 years of age with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n=58) or myelodysplastic syndrome (>/=10% blasts) (n=7) in a phase II non-randomized trial. The initial 22 patients received vosaroxin 90 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 4 with decitabine 20 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 every 4-6 weeks for up to seven cycles. Due to a high incidence of mucositis the subsequent 43 patients were given vosaroxin 70 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 4. These 65 patients, with a median age of 69 years (range, 60-78), some of whom with secondary leukemia (22%), adverse karyotype (35%), or TP53 mutation (20%), are evaluable. The overall response rate was 74% including complete remission in 31 (48%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery in 11 (17%), and complete remission with incomplete count recovery in six (9%). The median number of cycles to response was one (range, 1-4). Grade 3/4 mucositis was noted in 17% of all patients. The 70 mg/m(2) induction dose of vosaroxin was associated with similar rates of overall response (74% versus 73%) and complete remission (51% versus 41%, P=0.44), reduced incidence of mucositis (30% versus 59%, P=0.02), reduced 8-week mortality (9% versus 23%; P=0.14), and improved median overall survival (14.6 months versus 5.5 months, P=0.007). Minimal residual disease-negative status by multiparametric flow-cytometry at response (+/- 3 months) was achieved in 21 of 39 (54%) evaluable responders and was associated with better median overall survival (34.0 months versus 8.3 months, P=0.023).

We report here the prevalence of CVD and its risk factors in patients with CML treated by community-based United States (US) oncologists. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CML and >/= 1 encounter after the first date of CML diagnosis in an electronic medical record database between January 1, 2005 and October 31, 2014 were enrolled. CVD conditions/risk factors were assessed at baseline and during the 5-year follow-up period using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses codes and information from physician progress notes. One-year prevalence estimates were age- and gender-standardized for comparison to annual rates in the US population. RESULTS: A total of 1639 patients were included. At 5-year follow-up, the prevalence of CVD conditions and CVD risk factors was 33.0% and 77.7%, respectively. Compared with the general US adult population, the standardized prevalence rates at 1 year in patients with CML were significantly higher by factors of 1.3 to 3.5 times for CVD conditions, and 20% to 40% significantly higher for hypertension, diabetes, and obesity (P < .001). The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was not significantly higher in patients residing in the US Stroke Belt. CONCLUSION: The increased risk of CVD observed in this real-world analysis of patients with CML underscores the importance of current National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommendations to consider cardiovascular risk when selecting tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Coutinho, Anna D', 'Makenbaeva, Dinara', 'Farrelly, Eileen', 'Landsman-Blumberg, Pamela B', 'Lenihan, Daniel']","['Coutinho AD', 'Makenbaeva D', 'Farrelly E', 'Landsman-Blumberg PB', 'Lenihan D']","['Xcenda, LLC, Palm Harbor, FL.

Eighty patients (42 UCB and 38 RD recipients) with a day 100 blood sample were included in the analysis. Median age was 51 years (range, 20 to 71). Most patients had acute leukemia (50%) or lymphoma (23%) and received reduced-intensity conditioning (75%).

UCB recipients with high day 100 pDCs levels (>/= median) had 2-fold lower risk of relapse compared with those with pDC(low) (14% versus 28%, P = .29) and a trend to improved 1-year survival in multivariate analysis with hazard ratio of .22 (95% confidence interval, .04 to 1.05; P = .057).

Collectively, these data suggest that high levels of circulating pDCs at day 100 after UCB transplantation confer a survival advantage at 1 year.","['Touma, Waseem', 'Brunstein, Claudio G', 'Cao, Qing', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Curtsinger, Julie', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Bachanova, Veronika']","['Touma W', 'Brunstein CG', 'Cao Q', 'Miller JS', 'Curtsinger J', 'Verneris MR', 'Bachanova V']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Biostatistics and Informatics Core, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Colorado School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
