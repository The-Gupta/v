Epub 2018 Dec 10.,"Accumulation of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) on immune-related gene promoters underlies robust transcription during trained immunity. However, the molecular basis for this remains unknown. Here we show three-dimensional chromatin topology enables immune genes to engage in chromosomal contacts with a subset of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) we have defined as immune gene-priming lncRNAs (IPLs). We show that the prototypical IPL, UMLILO, acts in cis to direct the WD repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5)-mixed lineage leukemia protein 1 (MLL1) complex across the chemokine promoters, facilitating their H3K4me3 epigenetic priming. This mechanism is shared amongst several trained immune genes. Training mediated by beta-glucan epigenetically reprograms immune genes by upregulating IPLs in manner dependent on nuclear factor of activated T cells. The murine chemokine topologically associating domain lacks an IPL, and the Cxcl genes are not trained. Strikingly, the insertion of UMLILO into the chemokine topologically associating domain in mouse macrophages resulted in training of Cxcl genes. This provides strong evidence that lncRNA-mediated regulation is central to the establishment of trained immunity.","['Gene Expression and Biophysics Group, Division of Chemical, Systems and Synthetic Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'BTRI, CSIR Biosciences, Pretoria, South Africa.', 'Gene Expression and Biophysics Group, Division of Chemical, Systems and Synthetic Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'BTRI, CSIR Biosciences, Pretoria, South Africa.', 'Gene Expression and Biophysics Group, Division of Chemical, Systems and Synthetic Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Department of Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Gene Expression and Biophysics Group, Division of Chemical, Systems and Synthetic Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases/Virology, BioQuant Center, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Partner Site, German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Biomedical Technologies Group, CSIR Biosciences, Pretoria, South Africa.', 'Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases/Virology, BioQuant Center, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Partner Site, German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence CellNetworks, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Gene Expression and Biophysics Group, Division of Chemical, Systems and Synthetic Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. arhat@mhlangalab.org.', 'Gene Expression and Biophysics Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal. arhat@mhlangalab.org.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5320-2728', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5305-6791', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1601-6640', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1381-3409']",20181210,['Nat Rev Immunol. 2019 Feb;19(2):68-69.

Epub 2018 Dec 10.,"Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death and clarification of its molecular pathology is highly prioritized. The physiological importance of mRNA degradation through the CCR4-NOT deadenylase has recently been highlighted. For example, mutation in CNOT3, a gene coding for CNOT3 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, is found to be associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-ALL, though its contribution to other cancers has not been reported. Here, we provide evidence suggesting that CNOT3 is required for the growth of non-small cell lung cancer. Depletion of CNOT3 suppresses proliferation of A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells with enhanced mRNA stability and subsequent elevated expression of p21. In addition, we identified the mRNA for Kruppel-like factor 2 transcription factor, an inducer of p21, as a novel mRNA degradation target of CNOT3 in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Aberrant up-regulation of Kruppel-like factor 2 by CNOT3 depletion leads to impairment in the proliferation of A549 cells. Consistent with these findings, elevated mRNA expression of CNOT3 in non-small cell lung cancer in comparison with the paired normal lung epithelium was confirmed through scrutinization of the RNA-sequencing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between CNOT3 and CDKN1A (encoding p21) mRNA expression using the combined datasets of normal lung epithelium and non-small cell lung cancer. Thus, we propose that the up-regulation of CNOT3 facilitates the development of non-small cell lung cancer through down-regulation of Kruppel-like factor 2 and p21, contrary to tumor suppressive functions of CNOT3 in T-ALL.","['Cell Signal Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna-son, Okinawa, Japan. yo-taro.shirai@nih.gov.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. yo-taro.shirai@nih.gov.', 'Division of Molecular Biotherapy, Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Cell Signal Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna-son, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division for Health Service Promotion, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Cell Signal Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna-son, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Immunogenetics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Sciences, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Cell Signal Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna-son, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Immunogenetics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Sciences, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Cell Signal Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna-son, Okinawa, Japan. tadashi.yamamoto@oist.jp.', 'Laboratory for Immunogenetics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Sciences, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. tadashi.yamamoto@oist.jp.']",,20181210,,,"['21229006/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '25121734/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '16K18437/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '24890289/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '26893050/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '24890289/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '26830066/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '16K18437/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International', '26893050/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since B cell malignancies result from the clonal expansion of a single cell, IG genes represent a unique molecular signature common to all the malignant cells within an individual patient; thus, IG gene rearrangements can be used as clonal markers. In addition to serving as an important clonal identifier, the IG gene sequence can act as a 'molecular timeline' since it is associated with specific developmental stages and hence reflects the history of the B cell involved in the neoplastic transformation. Moreover, for certain malignancies, in particular chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the IG gene sequence holds prognostic and potentially predictive capabilities. That said, extrapolating meaningful conclusions from IG gene sequence analysis would be impossible if robust methods and tools were not available to aid in their analysis. This article, drawing on the vast experience of the European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC), details the technical aspects and essential requirements necessary to ensure reliable and reproducible IG gene sequence analysis in CLL, a test that is now recommended for all CLL patients prior to treatment. More specifically, the various analytical stages are described ranging from the identification of the clonotypic IG gene rearrangement and the determination of the nucleotide sequence to the accurate clinical interpretation of the IG gene sequence data.","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas; aagathangelidis@gmail.com.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University; Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet; Lesley-ann.sutton@ki.se.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas.', 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute.', 'Department of Immunology, Laboratory for Medical Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center.', 'Hematology Department, Nikea General Hospital.', 'Assistance publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Department of Hematology, and UPMC University Paris 06, UMRS 1138.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University; Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas; Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele.']",,20181126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia is an exception, where a sufficient number of leukemic cells can be isolated from the bone marrow. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for the isolation of leukemic cells from leukemia patients bone marrow and subsequent analysis of their metabolic state using extracellular flux analyzer. Leukemic cells are isolated by the density gradient, which does not affect their viability. The next cultivation step helps them to regenerate, thus the metabolic state measured is the state of cells in optimal conditions.

Although diets also affect our health, the effect of harmful dietary stresses on the tissue or stem cell homeostasis remains unclear. Recent research has revealed that Spred1, which negatively regulates RAS-MAPK signaling, protects hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis against high-fat diet (HFD) -induced systemic stress. In steady-state conditions, Spred1 negatively regulates HSC self-renewal in a manner supported by the Rho kinase (ROCK) activity. In addition, Spred1 deficiency in mice mitigates HSC dysfunction induced by aging or lipopolysaccharide treatment, enhances the HSC self-renewal capacity, and prolongs HSC lifespan, but does not induce leukemia because of the compensatory upregulation of Spred2-the other Spred family member. Conversely, HFD triggers ERK hyperactivation and aberrant self-renewal in Spred1-deficient HSCs, resulting in HSC dysfunction, severe anemia, and the development of lethal myeloproliferative neoplasm-like disease. The depletion of the gut microbiota by antibiotics restored myeloproliferation, anemia, and HSC reconstitution ability in HFD-fed Spred1-deficient mice, suggesting that HFD-induced hematopoietic abnormalities were partially because of alterations in the gut microbiota composition. Thus, HFD-induced systemic stress affects the regulation of HSC self-renewal, and Spred1 safeguards HSC homeostasis against the diet-induced systemic stress.","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Cancer and Stem Cell Research Program, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, Cancer and Stem Cell Research Program, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we hypothesized that diabetes-related depression might be associated with damage to the hippocampal neurovascular unit. To test this hypothesis, neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells were isolated from the brain tissues of rat embryos and newborn rats. Hippocampal neurovascular unit co-cultures were produced using the Transwell chamber co-culture system. A model of diabetes-related depression was generated by adding 150 mM glucose and 200 microM corticosterone to the culture system and compared with the neuron + astrocyte and astrocyte + endothelial cell co-culture systems. Western blot assay was used to measure levels of structural proteins in the hippocampal neurovascular unit co-culture system. Levels of basic fibroblast growth factor, angiogenic factor 1, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, transforming growth factor beta1, leukemia inhibitory factor and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the hippocampal neurovascular unit co-culture system were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining was used to assess neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal neurovascular unit. The neurovascular unit triple cell co-culture system had better barrier function and higher levels of structural and secretory proteins than the double cell co-culture systems. In comparison, in the model of diabetes-related depression, the neurovascular unit was damaged with decreased barrier function, poor structural integrity and impaired secretory function. Moreover, neuronal apoptosis was markedly increased, and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels were reduced. These results suggest that diabetes-related depression is associated with structural and functional damage to the neurovascular unit. Our findings provide a foundation for further studies on the pathogenesis of diabetes-related depression.","['First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.', 'Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.', 'First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.', 'First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.', 'First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.', 'Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.', 'First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.']",,,,,,,PMC6301159,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 7.,"Ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is an effective therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To determine whether rituximab provides added benefit to ibrutinib, we conducted a randomized single-center trial of ibrutinib vs ibrutinib plus rituximab. Patients with CLL requiring therapy were randomized to receive 28-day cycles of once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg, either as a single agent (n = 104), or together with rituximab (375 mg/m(2); n = 104), given weekly during cycle 1, then once per cycle until cycle 6. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We enrolled 208 patients with CLL, 181 with relapsed CLL and 27 treatment-naive patients with high-risk disease (17p deletion or TP53 mutation). After a median follow-up of 36 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.6-91.9) for patients receiving ibrutinib, and 86.9% (95% CI, 77.3-92.6) for patients receiving ibrutinib plus rituximab. Similarly, response rates were the same in both arms (overall response rate, 92%). However, time to normalization of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts and time to complete remission were shorter, and residual disease levels in the bone marrow were lower, in patients receiving ibrutinib plus rituximab. We conclude that the addition of rituximab to ibrutinib in relapsed and treatment-naive high-risk patients with CLL failed to show improvement in PFS. However, patients treated with ibrutinib plus rituximab reached their remissions faster and achieved significantly lower residual disease levels. Given these results, ibrutinib as single-agent therapy remains current standard-of-care treatment in CLL. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02007044.","['Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Biostatistics, and.', 'Department of Biostatistics, and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA; and.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA; and.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA; and.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6177-7572'],20181207,['Blood. 2019 Mar 7;133(10):1003-1004.

We performed clinicopathologic and genetic evaluation of 52 presumptive MPAL cases at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Only 29 out of 52 (56%) cases were confirmed to be bona fide MPAL according to the 2016 World Heath Organization classification. We identified PHF6 and DNMT3A mutations as the most common recurrent mutations in MPAL, each occurring in 6 out of 26 (23%) cases. These mutations are mutually exclusive of each other and BCR-ABL1/MLL translocations. PHF6- and DNMT3A-mutated MPAL showed marked predilection for T-lineage differentiation (5/6 PHF6 mutated, 6/6 DNMT3A mutated). PHF6-mutated MPAL occurred in a younger patient cohort compared with DNMT3A-mutated cases (median age, 27 years vs 61 years, P < .01). All 3 MPAL cases with both T- and B-lineage differentiation harbored PHF6 mutations. MPAL with T-lineage differentiation was associated with nodal or extramedullary involvement (9/15 [60%] vs 0, P = .001) and a higher relapse incidence (78% vs 22%, P = .017) compared with those without T-lineage differentiation. Sequencing studies on flow-cytometry-sorted populations demonstrated that PHF6 mutations are present in all blast compartments regardless of lineage differentiation with high variant allele frequency, implicating PHF6 as an early mutation in MPAL pathogenesis. In conclusion, PHF6 and DNMT3A mutations are the most common somatic alterations identified in MPAL and appear to define 2 distinct subgroups of MPAL with T-lineage differentiation with inferior outcomes.","['Hematopathology Diagnostic Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Hematopathology Diagnostic Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Diagnostic Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Diagnostic Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Diagnostic Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Cytogenetic Laboratory, Department of Pathology, and.', 'Cytogenetic Laboratory, Department of Pathology, and.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Service, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Hematopathology Diagnostic Service, Department of Pathology.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8586-8500'],,,['Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 9;3(7):956.

MicroRNA 146a (miR-146a) and miR-146b, both of which carry an identical seed sequence, have been shown to contribute to inflammatory diseases and tumors by suppressing the expression of key molecules required for NF-kappaB activation. However, the functional and physiological differences between miR-146a and miR-146b in disease onset have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we generated miR-146b-knockout (KO) and miR-146a-KO mice by genome editing and found that both strains developed hematopoietic malignancies such as B-cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia during aging. However, the B-cell lymphomas observed in miR-146a- and miR-146b-KO mice were histologically different in their morphology, and the malignancy rate is lower in miR-146b mice than miR-146a mice. Upon mitogenic stimulation, the expression of miR-146a and miR-146b was increased, but miR-146b expression was lower than that of miR-146a. Using a previously developed screening system for microRNA targets, we observed that miR-146a and miR-146b could target the same mRNAs, including TRAF6, and inhibit subsequent NF-kappaB activity. Consistent with these findings, both miR-146a- and miR-146b-KO B cells showed a high proliferative capacity. Taken together, sustained NF-kappaB activation in miR-146b KO mice could lead to the development of hematopoietic malignancy with aging.","['Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, and.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Research Core, Research Facility Cluster, Institute of Research, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo Japan.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Division of Surgical Pathology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Pathology and.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Human Pathology and.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, and.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, and.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4583-7667', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8564-2966', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5472-9030', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7110-2261', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3029-5287', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9073-9815']",,,,"['R01 AR050631/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR065379/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6290096,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 10.,"Antileukemia immunity plays an important role in disease control and maintenance of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-free remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Thus, antigen-specific immunotherapy holds promise for strengthening immune control in CML but requires the identification of CML-associated targets. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify naturally presented HLA class I- and class II-restricted peptides in primary CML samples. Comparative HLA ligandome profiling using a comprehensive dataset of different hematological benign specimens and samples from CML patients in deep molecular remission delineated a panel of novel frequently presented CML-exclusive peptides. These nonmutated target antigens are of particular relevance because our extensive data-mining approach suggests the absence of naturally presented BCR-ABL- and ABL-BCR-derived HLA-restricted peptides and the lack of frequent tumor-exclusive presentation of known cancer/testis and leukemia-associated antigens. Functional characterization revealed spontaneous T-cell responses against the newly identified CML-associated peptides in CML patient samples and their ability to induce multifunctional and cytotoxic antigen-specific T cells de novo in samples from healthy volunteers and CML patients. Thus, these antigens are prime candidates for T-cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches that may prolong TKI-free survival and even mediate cure of CML patients.","['Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Applied Bioinformatics, Center for Bioinformatics and Department of Computer Science, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) partner site Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Immatics Biotechnologies, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Immatics Biotechnologies, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Immatics US, Houston, Texas.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Neuroscience Center, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) partner site Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Applied Bioinformatics, Center for Bioinformatics and Department of Computer Science, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Quantitative Biology Center, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Biomolecular Interactions, Max-Planck-Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Translational Bioinformatics, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, DKFZ partner site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, DKFZ partner site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8107-0419', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8504-8481', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7135-0073', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7283-9778', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4507-5463', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0808-8097', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2828-4706', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2181-3911', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5947-3529', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9677-3723', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4737-1103', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3731-2385', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2920-3894', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6111-3901', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1739-4598', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1614-2647', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7430-1437', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6404-7391']",20181210,,,,,,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a robotic surgery system to achieve automated organelle biopsy of single cells with dimensions of less than 20 mum in diameter. The complexity of spatial detection of the organelle position is reduced by patterning the cells using a microfluidic chip device. A sliding mode nonlinear controller is developed to enable extraction of organelles, such as the mitochondria and the nucleus, from single cells with high precision. An image processing algorithm is also developed to automatically detect the position of the desired organelle. The effectiveness of the proposed robotic surgery system is demonstrated experimentally with automated extraction of mitochondria and nucleus from human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and human fibroblast cells. Extraction is followed by biological tests to indicate the functionality of biopsied mitochondria as well as the cell viability after removal of mitochondria. The results presented here have revealed that the proposed approach of automated organelle biopsy on single small cells is feasible.",,,20181210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,"Human DNA topoisomerases (topos) have been recognized as a good target molecule for the development of anticancer drugs because they play an important role in solving DNA topological problems caused by DNA strand separation during replication and transcription. In this study, we designed and synthesized 11 novel chromone backbone compounds possessing epoxy and halohydrin substituents with chirality. In the topos inhibition test, compounds 2, 9, 10, and 11 showed comparable topo I inhibitory activity at concentration of 100muM compared to camptothecin, and all of the synthesized compounds showed moderate topo IIalpha inhibitory activity. Among them, compounds 9, 10 and 11 were more potent than the others in both topo I and IIalpha inhibitory activity. Compound 11 showed the most potent cell antiproliferative activity against all tested cancer cell lines with particularly strong inhibition (an IC50 of 0.04microM) of K562 myelogenous leukemia cancer cell proliferation. In the brief structure-activity relationship analysis, there was no clear correlation between stereochemistry and topos inhibitory and cytotoxic activity. 5(R),7(S)-bisepoxy-substituted compound 11 was the most potent DNA cross-linker and induced G2/M arrest in a cell cycle assay in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After the treatment time period induced apoptosis in K562 cells without increasing G2/M-phase cells. Overall, compound 11 showed good consistent inhibitory biological activity related to cancer cell proliferation.","['College of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 120-750, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 120-750, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, CHA University, Pocheon 487-010, Republic of Korea.

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"BACKGROUND: The hypomethylating agent Decitabine (DAC) is a valuable treatment option in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in elderly patients (pts) not suitable for intensive chemotherapy (CHT). However, limited data are available about efficacy and safety of DAC in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of 104 AML pts treated with DAC in eight Italian Hematological Centers from 2015 to 2017. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DAC in older AML pts outside of clinical trial. Seventy-five (75%) pts received DAC as first line treatment (Cohort 1) and 29 pts as salvage therapy (Cohort 2). All pts received a DAC schedule of 20 mg/sqm IV for 5-days, every 28 days. The median age was 72.5 years (74 in cohort 1 and 66 in cohort 2) and 16% of pts had an ECOG performance status >2 at the start of DAC treatment (with non-significant difference in the two cohorts). The cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) was > 6 in 27% of pts. Forty-five pts (43%) had secondary AML. Bone marrow blast count was > 30% in 64% of patients (67/104). In the relapsed cohort 17/29 (59%) patients were treated with DAC after conventional CHT, 5/29 (17%) after allo-SCT and 7/29 (24%) after azacitidine therapy. RESULTS: A total of 469 DAC cycles were given to the 104 pts with a median of 3 cycles (range 1-21) and 45/104 (43%) pts received > 4 cycles. The Overall Response Rate (ORR = Complete Remission-CR plus Partial Remission-PR) was 33%, significantly higher in Cohort 1 (42%) compared to Cohort 2 (14%) (p = 0.009). The median duration of response was 6 months (range 1-20). In Cohort 1 the best response (CR or PR) was obtained between 3th and 6th cycle. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, achievement of CR or PR (HR = 0.78; p = 0.0004), CIRS < 6 (HR = 0.9; p = 0.04) and complex karyotype (HR = 0.8; p = 0.03) were significant predictors of better overall survival (OS). Median OS from the start of DAC therapy was 11 months for the whole population with a significant OS advantage in Cohort 1 (median OS 12.7 mths vs 6.3 mths; p = 0.003); median OS was significantly longer in responders compared to non-responders (22.6 mths vs 5.7 mths; p < 0.0001). At the last follow-up, 56 patients (54%) are still alive and 48 (46%) are dead (71% due to disease progression). The most common toxicities were myelosuppression and documented infectious complications that occurred mainly during the first 4 cycles. CONCLUSION: These data confirm the efficacy (ORR 33%) and the acceptable safety profile of DAC in the real life management of AML in elderly pts unsuitable for intensive CHT, with a significant better performance in first line therapy (ORR 42%, median OS 12.7 mths). The efficacy of DAC, both in first line and as salvage therapy, may probably be improved with combined treatment strategies and/or with different DAC schedules that could increase its anti-leukemic effect.","['Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata, Udine, Italy.

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), an epigenetic reader of acetyl lysine, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for many diseases including cancer, inflammation and heart failure. Our previous study reported that nitroxoline, an FDA approved antibiotic, showed potential BRD4 inhibitory activity and antiproliferation activity against leukemia cell lines. In this study, we further explored the structure-activity relationship (SAR) around nitroxoline and employed our previously developed machine learning based activity scoring function BRD4LGR for further analysis. To improve the cellular level activity, physico-chemical properties were optimized using computational approaches. Then the candidates were tested for their ADME/T profiles. Finally, based on this rational hit-to-lead optimization strategy, 3 drug-like BRD4 inhibitors were obtained, with different profiles on cell line selectivity for multiple myeloma, leukemia and triple negative breast cancer. Further mechanism study showed these compounds could down-regulate c-Myc to inhibit cancer cell growth. This work illustrates the application of multiple computer-aided drug design techniques in a hit-to-lead optimization scenario, and provides novel potent BRD4 inhibitors with different phenotype propensities for future cancer treatment.","['Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing, 100049, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing, 100049, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Suplead Co., LTD, Building D, 389 Ruoshui Road, Suzhou, 215000, China.', 'Suplead Co., LTD, Building D, 389 Ruoshui Road, Suzhou, 215000, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China; College of Life Science and Engineering, Henan University of Urban Construction, Pingdingshan, 467036, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China; School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.

Epub 2018 Dec 7.,"The optimal intensity of a conditioning regimen might be dependent on not only age and comorbidities but also disease activity and the type of graft source. We evaluated the outcome of unrelated single cord blood transplantation (CBT) using a conditioning regimen of fludarabine 180 mg/m(2), i.v. busulfan 9.6 mg/kg, 4 Gy total body irradiation, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-combined high-dose cytarabine (12 g/m(2)) in 23 elderly patients (median, 64 years) with nonremission myeloid malignancies between 2013 and 2018 in our institution. All but 1 patient achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 23.5 days (range, 18 to 50). With a median follow-up of 28 months, the probabilities of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years were 62%, 52%, and 26%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality at 100 days and 2 years were 9% and 22%, respectively. In the univariable analysis a higher proportion of blasts in bone marrow and in peripheral blood and a monosomal or complex karyotype were significantly associated with inferior OS and DFS. Poor cytogenetics were significantly associated with inferior DFS and increased relapse incidence. These data demonstrate that this reduced-toxicity myeloablative conditioning regimen was tolerable and effective in terms of engraftment, relapse, and survival in single CBT for elderly patients with nonremission myeloid malignancies.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"Prevalence of childhood obesity has worldwide more than doubled since 1980. Underlying factors are complex and are far from completely understood. Strategies to prevent childhood obesity have mainly focused on behavioral intervention; and obesity therapy was mainly based on lifestyle modification to date. However, effects for both have been quite limited so far and no country has succeeded in fighting the obesity epidemy we are facing. Normalization of body weight before onset of puberty is crucial for several reasons: First, obese children and adolescents frequently stay obese until adulthood. Second, obesity during adolescence is significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease such as type 2 diabetes in adulthood. And third, recent data have shown a strong association between higher body mass index (BMI) during adolescence and increased risk for several malignancies such as leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and others in adulthood. This review summarizes our current understanding of epidemiology, underlying factors, concomitant disease, as well as available intervention strategies and gives an overview of what has been reached so far and what measures should be undertaken to counteract the obesogenic environment.","['Department of Pediatrics I, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"Teratomas are tumors consisting of components of the three germ layers that differentiate from pluripotent stem cells derived from germ cells. In the normal mouse testis, teratomas rarely form, but a deficiency in Dead-end1 (Dnd1) in mice with a 129/Sv genetic background greatly enhances teratoma formation. Thus, DND1 is crucial for suppression of teratoma development from germ cells. In the Dnd1 mutant testis, nascent teratoma cells emerge at E15.5. To understand the nature of early teratoma cells, we established cell lines in the presence of serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from teratoma-forming cells in neonatal Dnd1 mutant testis. These cells, which we designated cultured Dnd1 mutant germ cells (CDGCs), were morphologically similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and could be maintained in the naive pluripotent condition. In addition, the cells expressed pluripotency genes including Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2; differentiated into cells of the three germ layers in culture; and contributed to chimeric mice. The expression levels of pluripotency genes and global transcriptomes in CDGCs as well as these cells' adaption to culture conditions for primed pluripotency suggested that their pluripotent status is intermediate between naive and primed pluripotency. In addition, the teratoma-forming cells in the neonatal testis from which CDGCs were derived also showed gene expression profiles intermediate between naive and primed pluripotency. The results suggested that germ cells in embryonic testes of Dnd1 mutants acquire the intermediate pluripotent status during the course of conversion into teratoma cells.","['Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kindai University, Nakamachi, Nara, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development-Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (AMED-CREST), Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Center for Regulatory Epigenome and Diseases, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is an effective new treatment for hematologic malignancies. Two CAR T-cell products are now approved for clinical use by the U.S. FDA: tisagenlecleucel for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes (DLBCL), and axicabtagene ciloleucel for DLBCL. CAR T-cell therapies are being developed for multiple myeloma, and clear evidence of clinical activity has been generated. A barrier to widespread use of CAR T-cell therapy is toxicity, primarily cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. Manifestations of CRS include fevers, hypotension, hypoxia, end organ dysfunction, cytopenias, coagulopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Neurologic toxicities are diverse and include encephalopathy, cognitive defects, dysphasias, seizures, and cerebral edema. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of CRS and neurotoxicity is continually improving. Early and peak levels of certain cytokines, peak blood CAR T-cell levels, patient disease burden, conditioning chemotherapy, CAR T-cell dose, endothelial activation, and CAR design are all factors that may influence toxicity. Multiple grading systems for CAR T-cell toxicity are in use; a universal grading system is needed so that CAR T-cell products can be compared across studies. Guidelines for toxicity management vary among centers, but typically include supportive care, plus immunosuppression with tocilizumab or corticosteroids administered for severe toxicity. Gaining a better understanding of CAR T-cell toxicities and developing new therapies for these toxicities are active areas of laboratory research. Further clinical investigation of CAR T-cell toxicity is also needed. In this review, we present guidelines for management of CRS and CAR neurotoxicity.","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Building 10, Suite 3-3330, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"INTRODUCTION: Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline (7+3) remains the standard of care for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 183 newly diagnosed AML patients to compare the utility of rapid peripheral blast clearance (PBC), day of peripheral blast disappearance, residual blasts, and cellularity at day 14 bone marrow biopsy (D14BM) in predicting clinical response to 7+3 induction, overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: In multivariable logistic regression analysis, day 2 PBC > 85% [P = .0016] was the only predictor of remission status, with sensitivity and specificity of 75%. Peripheral blast disappearance within 5 days after induction and < 10% cellularity in D14BM predicted superior OS and RFS in multivariate analysis. Median follow-up of patients was 28 months since diagnosis. Two-year OS and RFS for patients with </= 10% versus > 10% cellularity at D14BM was 60.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 50.8%-72.2%] versus 32.5% [95% CI, 23.0%-45.8%], and 51.9% [95% CI, 41.9%-64.3%] versus 28.8% [95% CI, 19.1%-43.4%], respectively [P = .0003 for OS and .002 for RFS]. CONCLUSION: Rapid PBC after 7+3 induction showed a significant improvement in specificity compared with D14BM, with similar sensitivity. Neither of these methods were reliably specific tools for the decision of early reinduction, despite their prognostic value. Our findings indicate that morphological cellularity in D14BM is an independent prognostic factor for OS and RFS, regardless of blast percentage, and that </= 10% cellularity defines D14BM hypoplasia.","['Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Case School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.

Epub 2018 Dec 6.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is widely used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPBSCT). The goal of this study was to retrospectively assess the effect of ATG on outcomes in the setting of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL). METHODS: In the analysis, 1170 adult patients undergoing alloPBSCT from human leucocyte antigen-matched sibling or unrelated donors in the first complete remission between 2007 and 2016 were included. ATG was used in 429/575 (75%) and 121/595 (20%) patients transplanted from unrelated or sibling donors, respectively. RESULTS: The incidence of chronic GVHD was 35% for patients treated with ATG compared with 52% in those not receiving ATG (p < 0.001), while the rate of extensive chronic GVHD was 16% and 36%, respectively (p < 0.001). The probability of survival free from GVHD and relapse (GRFS) was 42% and 32%, respectively (p = 0.002). In a multivariate model, the use of ATG was associated with reduced risk of overall chronic GVHD (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52, p < 0.001) and extensive chronic GVHD (HR = 0.46, p < 0.001). It was also associated with better GRFS (HR = 0.77, p = 0.007), despite increased risk of relapse (HR = 1.41, p = 0.02). No significant effect was found with regard to the risk of non-relapse mortality and overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ATG for patients with Ph+ ALL undergoing alloPBSCT is associated with reduced risk of chronic GVHD without impact on survival and therefore, could be considered. However, increased risk of relapse suggests the need for strict monitoring of minimal residual diseases and appropriate interventions after transplantation.","['Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute - Cancer Center, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.

These molecules were designed as drug-like derivatives of the resveratrol analogue DMU-212 and its cyano derivatives. Four compounds 8g, 8h, 10a and 10b exhibited LD50 values of 4.60microM, 0.02microM, 1.46microM, and 1.08microM, respectively, against MV4-11 leukemia cells.

Analogues 8g, 8h, 10a and 10b were also tested for their ability to inhibit the polymerization of tubulin, and compound 8h was found to be the most potent analogue. Molecular modeling studies demonstrated that 8h binds to the colchicine binding site on tubulin.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are haematopoietic stem cell-derived clonal disorders characterised by proliferation of some or all myeloid lineages, depending on the subtype. MPNs are classically categorized into three disease subgroups; essential thrombocythaemia (ET), polycythaemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The majority (>85%) of patients carry a disease-initiating or driver mutation, the most prevalent occurring in the janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2 V617F), followed by calreticulin (CALR) and myeloproliferative leukaemia virus (MPL) genes. Although these diseases are characterised by shared clinical, pathological and molecular features, one of the most challenging aspects of these disorders is the diverse clinical features which occur in each disease type, with marked variability in risks of disease complications and progression to leukaemia. A remarkable aspect of MPN biology is that the JAK2 V617F mutation, often occurring in the absence of additional mutations, generates a spectrum of phenotypes from asymptomatic ET through to aggressive MF, associated with a poor outcome. The mechanisms promoting MPN heterogeneity remain incompletely understood, but contributing factors are broad and include patient characteristics (gender, age, comorbidities and environmental exposures), additional somatic mutations, target disease-initiating cell, bone marrow microenvironment and germline genetic associations. In this review, we will address these in detail and discuss their role in heterogeneity of MPN disease phenotypes. Tailoring patient management according to the multiple different factors that influence disease phenotype may prove to be the most effective approach to modify the natural history of the disease and ultimately improve outcomes for patients.","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DS, United Kingdom.

Epub 2018 Dec 6.,"BACKGROUND: Chromosomal translocation-induced expression of the chromatin modifying oncofusion protein MLL-AF9 promotes acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Whereas WNT/beta-catenin signaling has previously been shown to support MLL-AF9-driven leukemogenesis, the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. METHODS: We used two novel small molecules targeting WNT signaling as well as a genetically modified mouse model that allow targeted deletion of the WNT protein chaperone Wntless (WLS) to evaluate the role of WNT signaling in AML progression. ATAC-seq and transcriptome profiling were deployed to understand the cellular consequences of disrupting a WNT signaling in leukemic initiating cells (LICs). FINDINGS: We identified Six1 to be a WNT-controlled target gene in MLL-AF9-transformed leukemic initiating cells (LICs). MLL-AF9 alters the accessibility of Six1 DNA to the transcriptional effector TCF7L2, a transducer of WNT/beta-catenin gene expression changes. Disruption of WNT/SIX1 signaling using inhibitors of the Wnt signaling delays the development of AML. INTERPRETATION: By rendering TCF/LEF-binding elements controlling Six1 accessible to TCF7L2, MLL-AF9 promotes WNT/beta-catenin-dependent growth of LICs. Small molecules disrupting WNT/beta-catenin signaling block Six1 expression thereby disrupting leukemia driven by MLL fusion proteins.","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA; Children's Medical Center Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA."", 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Institut Cochin, Universite Paris-Descartes, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), UMR, 8104, Paris, France; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1016, Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA; Children's Medical Center Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA."", 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.

Herein, we showed that knockdown of Mcl-1 significantly inhibited HCC cells to form spheres under ultra-low attachment condition in serum-free medium, and also attenuated clone formation. Inhibition of Mcl-1 by specific inhibitors S63845 or A-1210477 hindered secondary sphere formation, triggered apoptosis signaling and reduced the level of stem cell transcription factor Nanog, Sox2 and KLF4 in HCC spheroids cells. This study suggests that Mcl-1 is an essential factor for the survival and self-renewal of HCC CSLCs.","['Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation at Henan Universities, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China; Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, Henan, PR China.

Elderly CLL patients carry several challenges, which have to be considered particularly in advanced stages including a higher risk of infections and individual differences in comorbidities and geriatric syndromes. Although no specific tool for geriatric evaluation in CLL has been developed so far, several of them (e.g. CIRS or Charlson-Score) have been tested in CLL patients. Several treatment options exist for frontline and relapse therapy in unfit CLL patients. Less intensive chemoimmunotherapy with engineered CD20 antibodies (e.g. obinutuzumab) is one of the treatment options, if TP53 mutation or deletion has been ruled out by genetic testing. Single agent treatment with the Btk-inhibitor ibrutinib is not only approved in relapsed CLL; but also for frontline therapy. The kinase inhibitor idelalisib (plus rituximab) and the bcl2 inhibitor venetoclax are other novel compounds, which showed great efficacy in relapsed CLL even in unfit patients.

Nevertheless, the treatment concepts in elderly patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML are rapidly evolving. A number of recent reports have identified better survival rates with intensive induction chemotherapy for patients up to 80years, with the exception of patients with unfavorable genomic risk abnormalities or with major co-morbidities. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is increasingly added to induction therapy for AML patients up to 70years with favorable or intermediate risk profile, and Midostaurin for patients with a FLT3 mutation. The recommended dose of daunorubicin is 60mg/m(2) for 3+7 induction therapy. Elderly patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia should receive all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, and cytotoxic treatment is limited upfront to patients with initial leukocytosis. Allogeneic transplantation can be recommended to selected patients up to 70-75years. For patients unfit for intensive treatment, therapeutic options comprise a hypomethylating agent (HMA), low-dose cytarabin and supportive care. HMA treatment is also increasingly applied for relapsed/refractory AML after intensive chemotherapy.

The complete remission (CR) rate in these patients is lower than in other age groups and the percentage of deaths in induction or in CR remains high, ranging from 7 to 40%. Overall survival rates do not exceed 30%, depending on the age group included in the different trials group and on the follow-up duration. These unsatisfactory results are sustained by the fact that pre-existing comorbidities often hamper treatment delivery and if treatment intensification improves the CR rates it also increases toxicity and the percentage of deaths. Overall, the median life expectancy is rising world-wide, being in the western world around/over 80years (and increasing); in addition, the proportion of elderly individuals is growing progressively. This means that the management of these frail patients represents a true clinical unmet need. While in Ph+ ALL the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has markedly impacted on the outcome of patients of all ages, in Ph- ALL prognosis in the elderly still remains largely unsatisfactory. Novel strategies - mostly based on the use of monoclonal antibodies or of targeted strategies if druggable mutations can be identified - are largely needed. In the present review, we will discuss the past and current scenario, and provide an overview on the developing approaches for both Ph- and Ph+ elderly ALL, represented in particular by immunotherapy.","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.

However, an understanding of the extent of target inhibition required to arrest cell growth, necessary to develop an appropriate therapeutic strategy, remains unknown. Here, we utilize tunable depletion of endogenous BRM using the SMASh degron, and interestingly observe that BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells require near complete depletion of BRM to robustly inhibit growth both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, to identify pathways that synergize with partial BRM depletion and afford a deeper response, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen and discovered a combinatorial effect between BRM depletion and the knockout of various genes of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and the anti-apoptotic gene MCL1. Together these studies provide an important framework to elucidate the requirements of BRM inhibition in the BRG1-mutant state with implications on the feasibility of targeting BRM alone, as well as reveal novel insights into pathways that can be exploited in combination toward deeper anti-tumor responses.","['Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is integral to cell survival by maintaining protein homeostasis, and its dysfunction has been linked to cancer and several other human diseases. Through counteracting ubiquitination, deubiquitinases (DUBs) can either positively or negatively regulate UPS function, thereby representing attractive targets of cancer therapies. Previous studies have shown that metal complexes can inhibit tumor growth through targeting the UPS; however, novel metal complexes with higher specificity for cancer therapy are still lacking. METHODS: We synthesized a new gold(I) complex, Au(PPh3)PT. The inhibitory activity of Au(PPh3)PT on the UPS and the growth of multiple cancer cell types were tested in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Furthermore, we compared the efficacy of Au(PPh3)PT with other metal compounds in inhibition of UPS function and tumor growth. FINDINGS: Here we report that (i) a new gold(I) complex-pyrithione, i.e., Au(PPh3)PT, induced apoptosis in two lung cancer cell lines A549 and NCI-H1299; (ii) Au(PPh3)PT severely impaired UPS proteolytic function; (iii) Au(PPh3)PT selectively inhibited 19S proteasome-associated DUBs (UCHL5 and USP14) and other non-proteasomal DUBs with minimal effects on the function of 20S proteasome; (iv) Au(PPh3)PT induced apoptosis in cancer cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients; (v) Au(PPh3)PT effectively suppressed the growth of lung adenocarcinoma xenografts in nude mice; and (vi) Au (PPh3)PT elicited less cytotoxicity in normal cells than several other metal compounds. INTERPRETATION: Together, this study discovers a new gold(I) complex to be an effective inhibitor of the DUBs and a potential anti-cancer drug.

Individuals with preleukemic TET2 mutations manifest clonal hematopoiesis and are at a higher risk of developing leukemia. How inflammatory signals influence the survival of preleukemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is unclear. We show a rapid increase in the frequency and absolute number of Tet2-KO mature myeloid cells and HSPCs in response to inflammatory stress, which results in enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), and resistance to apoptosis. IL-6 induces hyperactivation of the Shp2-Stat3 signaling axis, resulting in increased expression of a novel anti-apoptotic long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), Morrbid, in Tet2-KO myeloid cells and HSPCs. Expression of activated Shp2 in HSPCs phenocopies Tet2 loss with regard to hyperactivation of Stat3 and Morrbid. In vivo, pharmacologic inhibition of Shp2 or Stat3 or genetic loss of Morrbid in Tet2 mutant mice rescues inflammatory-stress-induced abnormalities in HSPCs and mature myeloid cells, including clonal hematopoiesis.","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.

Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs is highly demanded. METHODS: In this study, by using whole-genome gene profiling, we identified Myeloid Ectopic Viral Integration Site 2 homolog (MEIS2) as a potential regulator of hESC early hematopoietic differentiation. We deleted MEIS2 gene in hESCs using the CRISPR/CAS9 technology and induced them to hematopoietic differentiation, megakaryocytic differentiation. RESULTS: In this study, we found that MEIS2 deletion impairs early hematopoietic differentiation from hESCs. Furthermore, MEIS2 deletion suppresses hemogenic endothelial specification and endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT), leading to the impairment of hematopoietic differentiation. Mechanistically, TAL1 acts as a downstream gene mediating the function of MEIS2 during early hematopoiesis. Interestingly, unlike MEIS1, MEIS2 deletion exerts minimal effects on megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet generation from hESCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings advance the understanding of human hematopoietic development and may provide new insights for large-scale generation of functional blood cells for clinical applications.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Science and Cancer Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha, 410013, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China. shilhxys@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. shilhxys@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300020, China. zhoujx@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. zhoujx@ihcams.ac.cn.']",,20181207,,['Stem Cell Res Ther. 2020 Oct 19;11(1):446.

CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a case of imatinib resistance due to an E255V mutation, followed by early post-transplant relapse with a T315I mutation that achieved a persistent negative deep molecular response (MR(5.0)) after treatment with single-agent ponatinib. Using CastPCR, we could trace back the presence of the T315I mutation to all the RNA samples up to the detection of T315 mutation by Sanger sequencing shortly after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Its surface protein marker CD20 plays an important role in the humoral immune response targeting which has emerged as an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of CLL. The present study explains the interaction of the CD20 with its established inhibitors and to discover the compound having high binding affinity against the target protein receptor. Technically, during the development of new compound through docking studies, best drug among all pre-exist drugs got filtered, hence in reference to docked best drug study moved ahead. METHODS: The 3D structure of CD20 was built using homology base fold recognition method using Smith waterman's Local alignment and standalone Delta Blast algorithms. 23 established inhibitors towards CD20 were selected in this present investigation. Among these inhibitors, etoposide (RMSD value -96.6481) showed high binding capacity with the receptor CD20 which was further subjected to virtual screening. The said screening presented 380 possible drugs having structural similarity to etoposide. RESULTS: The docking studies of the screened drugs separated the compound having PubChem CID: 11753896 (RMSD value -98.5416). Toxicity and interaction profile validated this compound for having a better affinity with the target protein. Conclusively, this research study says that according to ADMET profile and BOILED-Egg plot, the compound (PubChem CID: 11753896) obtained from Virtual Screen could be the best drug in future during the prevention of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. CONCLUSION: The compound identified in the present investigation can be subjected further for in vitro and in vivo studies for ADMET properties and it could optimize a good profile in the field of pharmacy and bioavailable for suppressing cancer. The pharmacophore study revealed that the drug CID11753896 is a non-inhibitor of CYP450 microsomal enzymes and was found to be non-toxic, similar to the established compound CID36462. It has a lower LD50 value of 2.5423mol/kg as compared to the established compound whose LD50 value is 2.9588mol/kg. Also, the compound was found to be non-carcinogenic.","['In silico Research Laboratory, Eminent Biosciences, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh, India.', 'In silico Research Laboratory, Eminent Biosciences, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh, India.', 'In silico Research Laboratory, Eminent Biosciences, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh, India.', 'In silico Research Laboratory, Eminent Biosciences, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh, India.', 'In silico Research Laboratory, Eminent Biosciences, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh, India.', 'Center of Excellence in Biotechnology Research, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Research Chair for Biomedical Applications of Nanomaterials, Biochemistry Department, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'In silico Research Laboratory, Eminent Biosciences, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh, India.', 'Bioinformatics Research Laboratory, LeGene Biosciences Pvt Ltd., Mahalakshmi Nagar, Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh, India.', 'Computer Aided Drug Designing and Molecular Modeling Lab, Department of Bioinformatics, Alagappa University, Karaikudi-630 003, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Center of Excellence in Biotechnology Research, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 10.,"Inhibition of normal cellular apoptosis or programed cell death is the hallmark of all cancers. Apoptotic dysregulation can result in numerous pathological conditions, such as cancers, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegeneration. Members of the BCL-2 family of proteins regulate the process of apoptosis by its promotion or inhibition and overexpression of the pro-survival anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) has been associated with tumor maintenance, growth and progression Small molecules and peptides which bind the BH3 binding groove of these proteins have been explored in the recent times for their anticancer potential. The first anticancer agents targeting this family of proteins were aimed primarily toward inhibition of Bcl-2. An elevated level of Mcl-1, despite Bcl-2 inhibition, continues to be a cause for resistance in most cancers. However, in silico exploration of Mcl-1 specific drugs and their associated mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. In order to understand the same, we have carried out docking and molecular dynamic simulations on ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally active inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w proteins; Obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor as well as Maritoclax, an Mcl-1 specific inhibitor. Docking studies revealed that binding to the hydrophobic grooves is a prerequisite for action on the BCL protein and the binding mechanism and chemical space utilization dictates stability as well as specificity of the inhibitor molecular dynamic simulations showed that on binding, the alpha-helices of these proteins exhibited less fluctuations than loop regions, also hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding were observed to be the predominant interactions in the drug-receptor complexes.

The emergence of synthetic biology approaches for cellular engineering provides a broadly expanded set of tools for programming immune cells for enhanced function. Advances in T cell engineering, genetic editing, the selection of optimal lymphocytes, and cell manufacturing have the potential to broaden T cell-based therapies and foster new applications beyond oncology, in infectious diseases, organ transplantation, and autoimmunity.","[""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain; email: sguedan@clinic.cat."", 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; email: cjune@upenn.edu.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; email: cjune@upenn.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Parker Institute for Cellular Immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; email: cjune@upenn.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Parker Institute for Cellular Immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",,20181210,,,"['K99 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7399614,,,,,['NIHMS1614453'],,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the relationship of CK with relapse incidence in 1559 consecutive APL patients enrolled in three consecutive trials. Treatment consisted of AIDA induction followed by risk-adapted consolidation. A CK (CK) was defined as the presence of >/=2 ACA, and a very CK (CK+) as >/=3 ACA. Eighty-nine patients (8%) had a CK, of whom 41 (4%) had CK+. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients with CK was 18%, and 12% in those with <2 ACA (p=.09). Among patients with CK+, the 5-year CIR was 27% vs 12% (p=.003), retaining the statistical significance in multivariate analysis. This study shows an increased risk of relapse among APL patients with CK + treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy front-line regimens.","['a Hospital Universitario de Burgos , Burgos , Spain.', 'b Department of Hematology , Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias , Oviedo , Spain.', 'c University Medical Center Groningen , University of Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands.', 'd Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, IIB-Sant Pau and Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institutes , Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.', 'e Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio , Sevilla , Spain.', 'f University Hospital of Salamanca-Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca , Salamanca , Spain.', 'g CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'h Department of Haematology and BMT , Silesian Medical University , Katowice , Poland.', 'i Hospital Clinic , Barcelona , Spain.', 'j Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara , Caceres , Spain.', 'k Hospital Insular , Las Palmas , Spain.', 'l Hospital General de Alicante , Alicante , Spain.', 'm Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'n Hospital Universitario Vall d Hebron , Barcelona , Spain.', 'o Hospital General , Albacete , Spain.', 'p Fundaleu , Buenos Aires , Argentina.', 'q Hospital 12 de Octubre , Madrid , Spain.', 'r Hospital Virgen de la Victoria , Malaga , Spain.', 's Hospital Clinico Universitario , Santiago de Compostela , Spain.', 't Hospital Puerta de Hierro , Madrid , Spain.', 'u ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute , Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.', 'v Hematology Department , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'g CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'w CIMA Lab Diagnostics , Pamplona , Spain.', 'x University of Navarra , Pamplona , Spain.', 'g CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'v Hematology Department , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'y Department of Haematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Wroclaw Medical University , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'z Erasmus University Medical Center , Rotterdam , The Netherlands.', 'g CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'v Hematology Department , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'aa Department of Medicine , University of Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'g CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'v Hematology Department , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7741-8697', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0491-1672', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4892-067X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1624-6059', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8056-648X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8229-1208', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3523-331X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5062-2364', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9622-1649', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9339-996X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3904-1101', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8679-6078', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1042-6024', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1785-5561', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0781-8668', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8982-5217', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3275-5593']",20181211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 20.,"G-quadruplexes (GQs) are guanine-rich, noncanonical nucleic acid structures that play fundamental roles in genomic stability and the regulation of gene expression. GQs are enriched in promoter sequences of growth regulatory genes and proto-oncogenes such as c-kit, which is linked to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mast cell disease, and leukemia. While GQs have become a popular subject for experimental and computational research, the forces governing GQ dynamics are not fully understood. To gain insights into cation interactions and base-dipole moments of these highly ordered nucleic acid structures, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the c-kit1 GQ using the CHARMM36 additive and Drude-2017 polarizable force fields. These simulations are the first of their kind to investigate the role of electronic polarization on interactions dictating GQ conformational sampling and cation interactions. Use of a polarizable model revealed differences in base dipole moments between GQs and B-form duplex DNA, force field-dependent ion binding pathways, and allowed for quantification of multibody contributions of water to ion-GQ interactions. These results emphasize the importance of electronic polarization as a contribution to the forces underlying nucleic acid dynamics.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6661-8653'],20181220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these derivatives, the most active compound, 4f, inhibited the growth of a panel of seven cancer cell lines with an IC50 in the low nanomolar range. In addition, 4f showed interesting activity against CA-4-resistant colon-carcinoma cells and multidrug-resistant leukemia cells. It also induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest. Structural data indicated binding of 4f to the colchicine site of tubulin, likely preventing the curved-to-straight tubulin structural changes that occur during microtubule assembly. Also, 4f disrupted the blood-vessel-like assembly formed by human umbilical-vein endothelial cells in vitro, suggesting its function as a vascular-disrupting agent.

Epub 2018 Dec 10.,"Human murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein is a primary endogenous cellular inhibitor of the tumor suppressor p53 and has been pursued as an attractive cancer therapeutic target. Several potent, nonpeptide, small-molecule inhibitors of MDM2 are currently in clinical development. In this paper, we report our design, synthesis, and evaluation of small-molecule MDM2 degraders based on the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) concept. The most promising compound (MD-224) effectively induces rapid degradation of MDM2 at concentrations <1 nM in human leukemia cells. It achieves an IC50 value of 1.5 nM in inhibition of growth of RS4;11 cells and also low nanomolar IC50 values in a panel of leukemia cell lines. MD-224 achieves complete and durable tumor regression in vivo in the RS4;11 xenograft tumor model in mice at well-tolerated dose schedules. MD-224 is thus a highly potent and efficacious MDM2 degrader and warrants extensive evaluations as a new class of anticancer agent.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8782-6950'],20181210,,,"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA208267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA219345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6545112,,,,,['NIHMS1020015'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jan 2.,"Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2), a key enzyme responsible for oxidative metabolism of various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, participates in a diverse array of physiological and pathological processes in humans. Its biological role in tumorigenesis and cancer diagnosis remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for real-time monitoring CYP2J2 in complex biological systems. Using molecular design principles, we were able to modify the distance between the catalytic unit and metabolic recognition moiety, allowing us to develop a CYP2J2 selective fluorescent probe using a near-infrared fluorophore ( E)-2-(2-(6-hydroxy-2, 3-dihydro-1 H-xanthen-4-yl)vinyl)-3,3-dimethyl-1-propyl-3 H-indol-1-ium iodide (HXPI). To improve the reactivity and isoform specificity, a self-immolative linker was introduced to the HXPI derivatives in order to better fit the narrow substrate channel of CYP2J2, the modification effectively shortened the spatial distance between the metabolic moiety ( O-alkyl group) and catalytic center of CYP2J2. After screening a panel of O-alkylated HXPI derivatives, BnXPI displayed the best combination of specificity, sensitivity and applicability for detecting CYP2J2 in vitro and in vivo. Upon O-demethylation by CYP2J2, a self-immolative reaction occurred spontaneously via 1,6-elimination of p-hydroxybenzyl resulting in the release of HXPI. Allowing BnXPI to be successfully used to monitor CYP2J2 activity in real-time for various living systems including cells, tumor tissues, and tumor-bearing animals. In summary, our practical strategy could help the development of a highly specific and broadly applicable tool for monitoring CYP2J2, which offers great promise for exploring the biological functions of CYP2J2 in tumorigenesis.","['College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology , Dalian 116024 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology , Dalian 116024 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'TCM and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Sino-Pakistan TCM and Ethnomedicine Research 8 Center, School of Pharmacy , Hunan University of Chinese Medicine , Changsha 410208 , China.', 'Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine , Shanghai 201203 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology , Dalian 116024 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology , Dalian 116024 , China.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Bath , Bath BA2 7AY , United Kingdom.', 'College of Integrative Medicine, The National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy , Dalian Medical University , Dalian 116044 , China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0876-2205', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6251-7908', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6801-3439', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6104-5056', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4095-2191', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4397-537X']",20190102,,['J Am Chem Soc. 2019 Aug 21;141(33):13278.

The relation between the expression of the PIM2 gene and the course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has not been fully determined. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of the PIM2 gene as a marker of CLL malignancy and its importance as a predictive and prognostic factor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients, 35 females and 32 males, aged 49-90 years, with de novo CLL, and 14 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. Expression of the PIM2 gene was analyzed using TaqMan RQ-PCR assay and western blot test. RESULTS: Median PIM2 gene expression in CLL patients was higher than in controls. Patients with high expression of the PIM2 gene had shorter progression-free survival and time to first treatment than patients with low PIM2 expression. It was found that patients with CR had lower expression of the PIM2 gene than patients without complete remission (CR). Notably, associations between high PIM2 expression and rapid lymphocyte doubling time, the percentage of malignant lymphocytes with ZAP70 expression and the Rai stage were revealed. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the PIM2 gene is associated with a more aggressive clinical course of CLL.","['Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 28.,"BACKGROUND: Rhodotorula spp are uncommon yeasts able to cause infections with high mortality rates. Rhodotorula infections have been associated with the presence of central venous catheter (CVC), immunosuppression, exposure to antifungals and the presence of either solid or haematologic malignancies. However, in this latter setting, only a few cases have so far been reported. OBJECTIVES: We have conducted a survey for Rhodotorula infections in haematologic patients. METHODS: Patients' clinical and microbiological data were collected and correlated to the outcome. RESULTS: A total of 27 cases were detected from 13 tertiary care hospitals. About 78% and 89% of patients had acute leukaemia and CVC. About 70% of patients were exposed to prophylaxis with azoles, mainly posaconazole (37%), 59% were severely neutropenic and 37% underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). The most frequent treatments were liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) and CVC removal in 17 and 16 patients, respectively. One month post-diagnosis, mortality was 26% and was associated with the presence of mucositis (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Rhodotorula spp should be considered as aetiologic agents of breakthrough infections in acute leukaemia patients with a CVC, mucositis, who receive prophylaxis with azoles, including posaconazole, and/or undergo alloSCT. Prompt measures, such as L-AmB administration and CVC removal, should be carried out to avoid the high mortality risk of Rhodotorula infections.","['Section of Hematology, Department of Surgical and Medical Sciences, AOU Policlinico, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Mycology, Allergy and Immunology, North Western State Medical University, Saint Petersburg, Russia.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Surgical and Medical Sciences, AOU Policlinico, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico A.

Epub 2018 Dec 7.,"Several molecules extracted from natural products exhibit different biological activities, such as ion channel modulation, activation of signaling pathways, and anti-inflammatory or antitumor activity. In this study, we tested the antitumor ability of natural compounds extracted from the Raputia praetermissa plant. Among the compounds tested, an alkaloid, here called compound S4 (4-Deoxyraputindole C), showed antitumor effects against human tumor lineages. Compound S4 was the most active against Raji, a lymphoma lineage, promoting cell death with characteristics that including membrane permeabilization, dissipation of the mitochondrial potential, increased superoxide production, and lysosomal membrane permeabilization. The use of cell death inhibitors such as Z-VAD-FMK (caspase inhibitor), necrostatin-1 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 inhibitor), E-64 (cysteine peptidases inhibitor), and N-acetyl- L-cysteine (antioxidant) did not decrease compound S4-dependent cell death. Additionally, we tested the effect of cellular activity on adherent human tumor cells. The highest reduction of cellular activity was observed in A549 cells, a lung carcinoma lineage. In this lineage, the effect on the reduction of the cellular activity was due to cell cycle arrest, without plasma membrane permeabilization, loss of the mitochondrial potential or lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Compound S4 was able to inhibit cathepsin B and L by a nonlinear competitive (negative co-operativity) and simple-linear competitive inhibitions, respectively. The potency of inhibition was higher against cathepsin L. Compound S4 promoted cell cycle arrest at G 0 and G 2 phase, and increase the expression of p16 and p21 proteins. In conclusion, compound S4 is an interesting molecule against cancer, promoting cell death in the human lymphoma lineage Raji and cell cycle arrest in the human lung carcinoma lineage A549.","['Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Bioquimica, Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi das Cruzes, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Universidade Braz Cubas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Bioquimica, Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi das Cruzes, Brasil.', 'Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Bioquimica, Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi das Cruzes, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil.', 'Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas, Universidade Federal do ABC, Santo Andre, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Universidade Braz Cubas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Alimentos e Nutricao, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3686-8402'],20181207,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the elevated expression of the CD33 antigen on leukemic blasts, therapeutic approaches to AML now feature the approved antibody drug conjugate (Mylotarg, GO) and investigational CART cell approaches incorporating CD33-binding domains derived from humanized scFvs. We designed a functional chimeric antigen receptor utilizing a human targeting sequence, derived from a heavy chain variable domain, termed CAR33VH. Lentiviral-based expression vectors which encoded CAR constructs incorporating the novel binding domain (CAR33VH), or the My96 scFv control binder (My96CAR) in frame with a CD8 hinge and transmembrane domain, a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and a CD3 zeta activation domain, were transduced into primary human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and CAR expression was confirmed by flow cytometry. CAR33VH, similar to My96CAR, demonstrated robust and specific cytotoxicity in short-term and long-term co-incubation killing assays against CD33(+) AML lines. In overnight cytokine release assays in which CAR T cells were challenged with the CD33(+) tumor cells HL-60, MOLM-14 and KG-1a, CAR33VH elicited IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2. This was seen with CD33(+) cell lines, but not when CAR T were cultured alone. Studies with a CD33(-) cell line engineered to stably express the full length CD33 variant 1, or the naturally occurring CD33 splice variant 2, revealed that both CAR33VH and My96CAR, target the V domain of CD33, suggesting a similar therapeutic profile. Colony-formation assays utilizing peripheral blood CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells treated with CAR33VH, My96CAR, or with an untransduced T cell control, yielded similar numbers of BFU-E erythroid and CFU-GM myeloid colonies, suggesting a lack of CAR-related overt toxicity. In an in vivo AML model, NSG mice engrafted with MOLM-14 cells stably expressing firefly luciferase, both CAR33VH and CARMy96 efficiently eliminated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility and efficacy of employing human variable domain-only binder derived from a phage display library in an anti-AML CAR design. CAR33VH, comprised of a human heavy-chain variable fragment-only antigen binding domain, was efficient in tumor killing in vitro and in vivo, and showed comparable functionality to the scFv-based My96CAR.","['Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Protein Interactions Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Protein Interactions Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, Ministries of Education and Health, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Protein Interactions Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Protein Interactions Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Center for Antibody Therapeutics, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', 'Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', ""Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States.""]",,20181122,,,,,PMC6262782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 12.,"Purpose of review: In this review, we aim to discuss the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in supporting hematopoiesis, with particular focus on the contribution of the endothelial niche in dictating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate. Recent findings: Evidence gathered in the past two decades revealed that specific cell types within the bone marrow niche influence the hematopoietic system. Endothelial cells have emerged as a key component of the HSC niche, directly affecting stem cell quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage differentiation. Physiological alterations of the bone marrow niche occurring in aging have been described to be sufficient to promote functional aging of young HSCs. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant activation of endothelial-derived signaling pathways can aid or trigger neoplastic transformation. Summary: Several groups have contributed to the characterization of the different cell types that comprise the complex bone marrow environment, whose function was long perceived as an undiscernible sum of many parts. Further studies will need to uncover niche cell-type-specific pathways, in order to provide new targets and therapeutic options that aim at withdrawing the microenvironmental support to malignant cells while sparing normal HSCs.","['1Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ 07110 USA.0000 0004 0407 6328grid.239835.6', '1Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ 07110 USA.0000 0004 0407 6328grid.239835.6', '2Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057 USA.0000 0001 1955 1644grid.213910.8']",,20181012,,,"['R01 CA204308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL133021/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6244548,"['Elisa Lazzari and Jason M.

Recent data indicate that R-2-HG released by malignant cells can accumulate in the extracellular space and be taken up by T lymphocytes, ultimately compromising their capacity to mediate anticancer immune responses. Thus, R-2-HG drives oncogenesis and tumor progression not only as a cancer cell-autonomous epigenetic modifier, but also as an immunosuppressive metabolite. Chemical inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2, which currently are under clinical evaluation, may therefore mediate dual anticancer effects by targeting cancer cells and, at the same time, relieving R-2-HG-mediated immunosuppression.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, US.', 'Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, New York, US.', 'Universite Paris Descartes/Paris V, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Equipe 11 labellisee par la Ligue contre le Cancer, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Cell Biology and Metabolomics platforms, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM, U1138, Paris, France.', 'Pole de Biologie, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris, France.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Center of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Suzhou, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9334-4405'],20181016,,,,,PMC6279319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological therapies including monoclonal antibodies and immune effectors have been the subject of multiple research projects. Pore-forming proteins may become the other biological strategy to overcome the problems associated with current treatments. But detailed mechanisms of their action on target membranes remained to be elucidated. We aimed to study the cytotoxic effects of recombinant form of fragaceatoxin C on AML cell lines HL-60 and KG-1. Materials and Methods: We cloned the FraC gene in pET-28a (+) bacterial expression vector and the expressed recombinant FraC protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Then, cytotoxic effects of the recombinant protein were examined on two AML cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1. Effects of serum and calcium ion were explored by hemolysis assay in more details. Results: Our results showed that the recombinant C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged FraC protein has potent cytotoxic effects on both AML cell lines, with IC50=5.6, and 4.6 microg.ml-1 for HL-60 and KG-1 cells, respectively. Serum showed dose-dependent and also time-dependent inhibitory effects on the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the FraC protein. Pre-incubation of the toxin with different concentrations of calcium ion also inhibited hemolytic activity of FraC toxin. Conclusion: Results of the present study showed that FraC has potential anti-tumor effects. By detailed investigation of the inhibition mechanism of serum and calcium effects in the future, it can be possible to design target sites for clinical applications of the toxin.","['Protein Engineering Laboratory, Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Faculty of Paramedicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Protein Engineering Laboratory, Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Protein Engineering Laboratory, Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Protein Engineering Laboratory, Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Protein Engineering Laboratory, Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Faculty of Paramedicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.']",,,,,,,PMC6272064,['The authors declare that no conflict of interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"PURPOSE: The MURANO study demonstrated significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit for fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. With all patients off treatment, we report minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics and updated outcomes. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 years of venetoclax plus rituximab during the first six cycles, or six cycles of bendamustine-rituximab. Primary end point was PFS. Safety and peripheral blood (PB) MRD status-at cycle 4, 2 to 3 months after end of combination therapy (EOCT), and every 3 to 6 months thereafter-were secondary end points. RESULTS: Of 194 patients, 174 (90%) completed the venetoclax-rituximab phase and 130 (67%) completed 2 years of venetoclax. With a median follow-up of 36 months, PFS and overall survival remain superior to bendamustine-rituximab (hazard ratio, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.23]; and hazard ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.30 to 0.85], respectively). Patients who received venetoclax-rituximab achieved a higher rate of PB undetectable MRD (uMRD; less than 10(-4)) at EOCT (62% v 13%) with superiority sustained through month 24 (end of therapy). Overall, uMRD status at EOCT predicted longer PFS. Among those with detectable MRD, low-level MRD (10(-4) to less than 10(-2)) predicted improved PFS compared with high-level MRD (10(-2) or greater). At a median of 9.9 months (range, 1.4 to 22.5 months) after completing fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab, overall only 12% (16 of 130) of patients developed disease progression (11 high-level MRD, three low-level MRD). At the end of therapy, 70% and 98% of patients with uMRD remained in uMRD and without disease progression, respectively. CONCLUSION: With all patients having finished treatment, continued benefit was observed for venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab. uMRD rates were durable and predicted longer PFS, which establishes the impact of PB MRD on the benefit of fixed-duration, venetoclax-containing treatment. Low conversion to detectable MRD and sustained PFS after completion of 2 years of venetoclax-rituximab demonstrate the feasibility of this regimen.","['1 Amsterdam Universitair Medische Centra, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', '2 Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""3 St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", '4 University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', '5 Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', '6 University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', '7 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '8 Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', '8 Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', '8 Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', '8 Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', '9 Roche Products Limited, Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom.', '9 Roche Products Limited, Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom.', '8 Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', '10 University of California School of Medicine, San Diego, CA.']",,20181203,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02005471'],,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the relevance of this topic to the ASCO membership, ASCO reviewed the guideline and applied a set of procedures and policies for endorsing clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other professional organizations. METHODS: The CAP-ASH guideline on initial diagnostic work-up of AL was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. Then, an ASCO Endorsement Expert Panel updated the literature search and reviewed the content and recommendations. RESULTS: The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations from the guideline, published in 2016, are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO fully endorsed the CAP-ASH guideline on initial diagnostic work-up of AL and included some discussion points according to clinical practice and updated literature. CONCLUSION: Twenty-seven guideline statements were reviewed. Some discussion points were included to better assess CNS involvement in leukemia and to provide novel insights into molecular diagnosis and potential markers for risk stratification and target therapy. These discussions are categorized into four sections: (1) initial diagnosis focusing on basic diagnostics and determination of risk parameters, (2) molecular markers and minimal residual disease detection, (3) context of referral to another institution with expertise in the management of AL, and (4) reporting and record keeping for better outlining and follow-up discussion.

Epub 2018 Dec 6.,"The addition of a single beta-d-GlcNAc sugar (O-GlcNAc) by O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc removal by O-GlcNAcase (OGA) maintain homeostatic O-GlcNAc levels on cellular proteins. Changes in protein O-GlcNAcylation regulate cellular differentiation and cell fate decisions, but how these changes affect erythropoiesis, an essential process in blood cell formation, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation in erythropoiesis by using G1E-ER4 cells, which carry the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-binding protein 1 (GATA-1) fused to the estrogen receptor (GATA-1-ER) and therefore undergo erythropoiesis after beta-estradiol (E2) addition. We observed that during G1E-ER4 differentiation, overall O-GlcNAc levels decrease, and physical interactions of GATA-1 with both OGT and OGA increase. RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis of G1E-ER4 cells differentiated in the presence of the OGA inhibitor Thiamet-G (TMG) revealed changes in expression of 433 GATA-1 target genes. ChIP results indicated that the TMG treatment decreases the occupancy of GATA-1, OGT, and OGA at the GATA-binding site of the lysosomal protein transmembrane 5 (Laptm5) gene promoter. TMG also reduced the expression of genes involved in differentiation of NB4 and HL60 human myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic differentiation. Sustained treatment of G1E-ER4 cells with TMG before differentiation reduced hemoglobin-positive cells and increased stem/progenitor cell surface markers. Our results show that alterations in O-GlcNAcylation disrupt transcriptional programs controlling erythropoietic lineage commitment, suggesting a role for O-GlcNAcylation in regulating hematopoietic cell fate.","['Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'Biostatistics, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160; Cancer Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'Biostatistics, Kansas City, Kansas 66160; Cancer Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160; Cancer Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160; Anatomy and Cell Biology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.

Epub 2018 Dec 6.,"Monosomal karyotype confers a poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we determined the impact of the type of remission-induction chemotherapy and the impact of having a donor in younger acute myeloid leukemia patients with a monosomal karyotype included in two phase III trials. In the first trial patients were randomized to receive either daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, or idarubicin in addition to standard-dose cytarabine and etoposide for induction chemotherapy. In the second trial patients were randomized to standard-dose cytarabine or high-dose cytarabine induction, both with daunorubicin and etoposide. In both trials, patients who achieved a complete remission with or without complete hematologic recovery underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if they had a donor; otherwise, they underwent autologous transplantation. In comparison to patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics without a monosomal karyotype (n=1,584) and with adverse cytogenetics without a monosomal karyotype (n=218), patients with a monosomal karyotype (n=188) were more likely not to achieve a complete remission with or without count recovery [odds ratio=2.85, 95% confidence interval (95%, CI): 2.10-3.88] and had shorter overall survival [hazard ratio, (HR)=2.44, 95% CI: 2.08-2.88]. There was no impact of the type of anthracycline or of the dose of cytarabine on outcomes in patients with a monosomal karyotype. Among monosomal karyo type patients who achieved a complete remission with or without count recovery, HLA-identical related donor availability was associated with longer survival from complete remission with or without count recovery (HR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.37-0.95).

Epub 2018 Dec 6.,"Measurable residual disease is associated with inferior outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Measurable residual disease monitoring enhances risk stratification and may guide therapeutic intervention. The European LeukemiaNet working party recently came to a consensus recommendation incorporating leukemia associated immunophenotype-based different from normal approach by multi-color flow cytometry for measurable residual disease evaluation. However, the analytical approach is highly expertise-dependent and difficult to standardize. Here we demonstrate that loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cell differentiation after 7+3 induction in AML is highly specific for measurable residual disease positivity (specificity 97.4%) in a uniformly treated patient cohort. Moreover, loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cell differentiation as determined by a blast-to-plasmacytoid dendritic cell ratio >10 was strongly associated with inferior overall and relapse-free survival (RFS) [Hazard ratio 2.79, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.98-7.97; P=0.077) and 3.83 (95%CI: 1.51-9.74; P=0.007), respectively), which is similar in magnitude to measurable residual disease positivity. Importantly, measurable residual disease positive patients who reconstituted plasmacytoid dendritic cell differentiation (blast/ plasmacytoid dendritic cell ratio <10) showed a higher rate of measurable residual disease clearance at later pre-transplant time points compared to patients with loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cell differentiation (blast/ plasmacytoid dendritic cell ratio <10) (6 of 12, 50% vs 2 of 18, 11%; P=0.03). Furthermore pre-transplant plasmacytoid dendritic cell recovery was associated with superior outcome in measurable residual disease positive patients. Our study provides a novel, simple, broadly applicable, and quantitative multi-color flow cytometry approach to risk stratification in AML.","['Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Diagnostic Service xiaow@mskcc.org roshalm@mskcc.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Diagnostic Service.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Diagnostic Service.', 'Clinical Pharmacy.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Center for Cell Engineering.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Department of Pathology, Cytogenetics Laboratory.', 'Department of Medicine, Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Diagnostic Service xiaow@mskcc.org roshalm@mskcc.org.']",,20181206,,,"['K08 CA215317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA184746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6601104,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"BACKGROUND: Both single-agent ibrutinib and chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab have shown superior efficacy to chlorambucil monotherapy and are standard first-line treatments in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We compared the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. METHODS: iLLUMINATE is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 74 academic and community hospitals in Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, Russia, Turkey, the EU, and the USA in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, either aged 65 years or older or younger than 65 years with coexisting conditions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a blocked randomisation schedule, stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and cytogenetics, to receive ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab (oral ibrutinib [420 mg once daily continuously] combined with intravenous obinutuzumab [100 mg on day 1, 900 mg on day 2, 1000 mg on day 8, and 1000 mg on day 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles, for a total of six cycles]) or chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (oral chlorambucil [0.5 mg/kg bodyweight on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for six cycles] combined with the same obinutuzumab regimen). Allocation concealment was achieved using an interactive web response system. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by a masked independent review committee in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02264574), and patient enrolment is complete. FINDINGS: Between Oct 6, 2014, and Oct 12, 2015, 229 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab (n=113) or chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (n=116). After a median follow-up of 31.3 months (IQR 29.4-33.2), median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab group (median not reached [95% CI 33.6-non-estimable]) than in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group (19.0 months [15.1-22.1]; hazard ratio 0.23; 95% CI 0.15-0.37; p<0.0001). Estimated 30-month progression-free survival was 79% (95% CI 70-85) in the ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab group and 31% (23-40) in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in both groups were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Serious adverse events occurred in 65 (58%) of 113 patients treated with ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab and 40 (35%) of 115 patients treated with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab. Ibrutinib or chlorambucil treatment-related deaths were reported in one (1%) of 113 patients in the ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab group (sudden death) and one (1%) of 115 patients in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin). INTERPRETATION: Ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab is an efficacious and safe chemotherapy-free combination treatment in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma independent of high-risk features and provides an alternative first-line treatment option for these patients.

Epub 2018 Oct 26.,"CD84 (SLAMF5) is a member of the SLAM family of cell-surface immunoreceptors. Broadly expressed on most immune cell subsets, CD84 functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, whose signaling can activate or inhibit leukocyte function depending on the cell type and its stage of activation or differentiation. CD84-mediated signaling regulates diverse immunological processes, including T cell cytokine secretion, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, monocyte activation, autophagy, cognate T:B interactions, and B cell tolerance at the germinal center checkpoint. Recently, alterations in CD84 have been related to autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders. Specific allelic variations in CD84 are associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CD84 mediates intrinsic and stroma-induced survival of malignant cells. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the structure and function of CD84 and its potential role as a therapeutic target and biomarker in inflammatory autoimmune disorders and cancer.","['Immunology Unit, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

Very few paediatric cases have been published concerning the use of isavuconazole. Amphotericin B is the only antifungal agent recommended in paediatric mucormycosis, but adverse effects and especially nephrotoxicity, even with the liposomal formulation, could be problematic. In this context, the use of other antifungal molecules active on Mucorales becomes needful. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of mucormycosis with rapid onset dissemination in a 3-year-old girl recently diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukaemia. She was successfully treated with isavuconazole alone and then in combination with liposomal amphotericin B. Isavuconazole therapy was guided by therapeutic drug monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This case offers new perspectives on the potential use of isavuconazole in children with mucormycosis, as an alternative or adjunct to liposomal amphotericin B.","['Laboratoire de Parasitologie Mycologie, CHU Lille, Univ.

To examine such a putative association, this analysis reports the association between SLE and the risks of 24 cancer types. METHODS: Online databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies, published up to 15 May 2018. Pooled standardized incidence rates (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to reveal their associations. RESULTS: A total of 24 eligible studies were ultimately enrolled. Our results indicated that SLE was associated with increased risk of overall cancers, cancer risk in both genders, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, cervix, vagina/vulva, renal, bladder, esophagus, gastric, hepatobiliary, lung, oropharynx, larynx, non-melanoma skin, and thyroid cancers. Additionally, SLE could reduce the risk of prostate cancer and cutaneous melanoma; however, it was not significantly associated with breast, uterus, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal, or brain cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results shed light SLE being correlated with increased risk for 16 involved cancers and decreased risk for prostate cancer and cutaneous melanoma. This comprehensive meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence supporting the associations between SLE and cancer risk. This evidence could be utilized to drive public policies and to help guide personalized medicine to better manage SLE and reduce associated cancer morbidity and mortality.","['Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No. 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No. 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No. 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No. 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No. 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China. xiaoyunhl@126.com.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No. 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China. luyan6289@163.com.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9470-0299'],20181206,,,,,PMC6282326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The cohort included 604 cases of B-cell lymphoma which were collected at West China Hospital from May 2010 to December 2016.And all were subjected to interphase FISH using 11 break apart or fusion probes (MYC, bcl-2, bcl-6, IRF4, MYC/IgH, bcl-2/IgH, CCND1/IgH, IgH, API2/MALT1, p53/ATM, and D13S319/CEP12). Results: The median age of the 604 B-cell lymphoma patients was 47.7 (aged 2-90) years including 372 men and 232 women. All the cases was divided into 463 large B cell lymphomas(LBL) and 141 small B cell lymphomas, and the total interphase FISH positive rate was 59.8% (361/604). Among the 463 LBL, 12.5% (58/463), 9.5% (44/463) and 2.2% (10/463) of cases showed MYC, bcl-6 and bcl-2 gene rearrangements respectively; and 363 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCLs) were reclassified as germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype (38.6%, 140/363) and non-GCB subtype (61.4%, 223/363) by Hans algorithm. The rearrangement rates in GCB and non-GCB DLBCL were 45.7%(64/140)and 21.5%(48/223; P=0.001), respectively. Compared to the non-GCB DLBCL, GCB DLBCL showed higher MYC and bcl-2 gene rearrangements (P=0.001). Eleven (2.4%, 11/463) cases had MYC and bcl-6 or bcl-2 gene rearrangement (double-hit lymphoma); one (0.2%, 1/463) case had MYC, bcl-6 and bcl-2 gene rearrangements (triple-hit lymphoma); two (0.4%, 2/463) cases had bcl-2 and bcl-6 gene rearrangements. MYC translocation and MYC/IgH fusion were detected in 94.2%(81/86) and 83.7%(72/86) cases of Burkitt lymphomas. IRF4 rearrangement was detected in two cases of IRF4+ LBCL. Genetic abnormalities were detected in 9/19, 100%(29/29), 30.8%(12/39) and 68.5%(37/54) cases of follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, MALT lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, respectively.

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"Oncogenic activation of tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is recurrent in human leukemia. The acquired Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) K607N somatic mutation was detected in about 6.8% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, roles of JAK2 K607N mutation in the leukemogenesis of AML remain unclear. In this study, loss of interaction between K607 and E877 was identified as key reasons for JAK2 K607N mutation constitutive activation. JAK2 K607N and mutations (K607A, K607G and E877A) abolished the K607 and E877 interaction caused JAK2 constitutive activation. While, mutations (K607R, E877D) repairing this interaction reduced K607N mutation's activity. Furthermore, our studies showed that disruption of K607 and E877 interaction abolished JH1/JH2 domains' interactions and led to JAK2 constitutive activation. More importantly, JAK2 K607N and mutations disrupted this interaction enhanced JAK2-STAT5 pathway activation and the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Thus our studies provide clues in understanding the leukemogenesis of JAK2 K607N mutation in AML.","['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', ""College of Life Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong 271018, China."", 'Department of Cell Biology and Neurobiology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.

Epub 2018 Dec 6.,"BACKGROUND: The revised 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification (ELN-2017) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) divides patients into 3 prognostic risk categories, with additional factors such as the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) allele ratio (AR) considered for risk stratification. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the prognostic usefulness of ELN-2017 in comparison with ELN-2010 in younger patients with AML has not been validated to date. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective study on patients aged <60 years who received idarubicin plus cytarabine (IA)-based induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. RESULTS: According to ELN-2017 criteria, the number of patients in the favorable (Fav), intermediate (Int), and adverse (Adv) risk categories was 192 patients (27%), 331 patients (46%), and 192 patients (27%), respectively. Overall survival probabilities at 5 years in the Fav, Int, and Adv groups were 57%, 37%, and 18%, respectively. In comparison, the 5-year overall survival probabilities in the Fav (169 patients), intermediate (IR)-1 (80 patients), IR-2 (306 patients), and Adv (160 patients) ELN-2010 categories were 59%, 32%, 40%, and 14%, respectively. Although ELN-2010 historically distinguishes prognosis into IR-1 and IR-2 categories in younger patients, this difference was nullified in the current study cohort. When comparing patients with a low FLT3-ITD AR with those with a high FLT3-ITD AR, no significant differences in survival were noted among patients with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1)-mutated AML (P = .28) or wild-type NPM1 (P = .35), and in those treated with IA alone (P = .79) or those treated with IA and a FLT3 inhibitor (P = .10). CONCLUSIONS: The ELN-2017 more accurately distinguishes prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed AML. The lack of prognostic significance for the FLT3-ITD AR needs further evaluation in different treatment settings.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9408-5882', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5511-6153', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307']",20181206,,,"['K12 CA088084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6561101,,['(c) 2018 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS1029096'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study compared long-term outcomes based on MRD kinetics for 79 patients with RIC transplants and 116 patients with MAC transplants in first complete remission (CR1) after tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based chemotherapy (median follow-up, 67.1 months). MRD monitoring was centrally evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for all patients. RESULTS: RIC showed a cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; 30.6% vs 31.7%), nonrelapse mortality (17.5% vs 14.9%), disease-free survival (DFS; 51.9% vs 53.4%), and overall survival (61.1% vs 61.4%) comparable to those associated with MAC. In all MRD kinetics-based subgroups, no differences in CIR (early complete molecular response [CMR], 19.3% vs 4.8%; early major molecular response [MMR], 17.0% vs 26.8%; late CMR, 20.0% vs 14.3%; late MMR, 28.3% vs 31.0%; poor molecular response [PMR], 57.9% vs 62.4%) or DFS (early CMR, 71.6% vs 76.2%; early MMR, 66.9% vs 52.1%; late CMR, 50.0% vs 64.3%; late MMR, 50.7% vs 53.7%; PMR, 31.6% vs 34.1%) were observed between RIC and MAC. In a multivariate analysis, the conditioning intensity had no significant impact on transplantation outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: RIC is a valid alternative choice for long-term disease control and is worthy of further investigation in prospective trials for adult Ph-positive ALL in CR1.","['Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2145-9131', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9810-2050']",20181206,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are uncertainties about the exposure response, particularly risks by time since exposure and age at exposure. METHODS: In a case-cohort study in 110 631 Chinese workers followed up during 1972-1999 we evaluated combined MDS/AML (n = 44) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 18). We estimated benzene exposures using hierarchical modeling of occupational factors calibrated with historical routine measurements, and evaluated exposure response for cumulative exposure and average intensity using Cox regression; P values were two-sided. RESULTS: Increased MDS/AML risk with increasing cumulative exposure in our a priori defined time window (2 to <10 years) before the time at risk was suggested (Ptrend = 08). For first exposure (within the 2 to <10-year window) before age 30 years, the exposure response was stronger (P = .004) with rate ratios of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27 to 4.29), 5.58 (95% CI = 1.65 to 19.68), and 4.50 (95% CI = 1.22 to 16.68) for cumulative exposures of more than 0 to less than 40, 40 to less than 100, and at least 100 ppm-years, respectively, compared with no exposure. There was little evidence of exposure response after at least 10 years (Ptrend = .94), regardless of age at first exposure. Average intensity results were generally similar. The risk for chronic myeloid leukemia was increased in exposed vs unexposed workers, but appeared to increase and then decrease with increasing exposure. CONCLUSION: For myeloid neoplasms, the strongest effects were apparent for MDS/AML arising within 10 years of benzene exposure and for first exposure in the 2 to less than 10-year window before age 30 years.","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Environmental Epidemiology, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, Peoples Republic of China.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, Peoples Republic of China.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD.']",,,,,,,PMC6681472,,['Published by Oxford University Press 2018.'],,,,,"['Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention-US National Cancer Institute', 'Benzene Study Group']",,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jan 4.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent leukemia type in which the genetic alterations influencing the clinico-biological course are not entirely understood. CLL has a heterogeneous course, with some patients showing an indolent course and others experiencing an aggressive course. Whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing studies identified recurrently mutated genes in CLL and profiled its clonal evolution patterns. However, more recent whole-genome sequencing studies also identified variants in non-coding sequences of the CLL genome, revealing important lesions outside the protein-coding regions. Here we describe the most representative non-coding lesion of the CLL genome, including lesions in the 3'-UTR region of NOTCH1 which result in the truncation of the NOTCH1 protein PEST domain, and non-coding mutations in an enhancer region on chromosome 9p13 which result in reduced expression of the PAX5 transcription factor. In addition, we describe the role of microRNA in CLL, in particular the miR15a/miR16-1 microRNA recurrently affected by deletions of chromosome 13q14. Together, new findings in non-coding genome genetic lesions provide a more complete portrait of the genomic landscape of CLL with clinical implications.","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.']",,20190104,,,,,PMC6322188,,['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Methods: Data were retrieved through a Global Burden of Disease (GBD, 2016) database (Viz Hub) that is developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Results: The incidence of cancer increased around 26-fold for thyroid cancer; approximately 10-fold in breast, colon, bladder and uterine cancers; 8-fold for prostate cancer; 5-fold for renal cancer; 4-fold for pancreatic and ovarian cancer; 3.5-fold for lung cancer; 3-fold for liver cancer, and 2 folds for lymphoma, leukemia and gastric cancer. There was also an increase in the percentage of mortality due to cancer during this period. However, we noticed that the percentage of deaths due to cancer decreased after 70 years of age in Saudi Arabia population. Conclusion: The increases in the incidence of different types of cancer in the past decade could be due to the revolutionary change in socioeconomic status that has occurred in Saudi Arabia; therefore, a national plan should be established for cancer prevention, screening and therapy. Concerning mortality, the decrease in its percentage among elderly people could be due to biological factors that should be investigated in the future.","['Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Epub 2019 Jan 1.,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) share a genetic basis with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, whether MetS and its components mediate genetic susceptibility to T2D is not completely understood. METHODS: We assessed the effects of MetS and its components on associations T2D and 18 genome-wide association studies-identified variants using a two-stage strategy based on parametric models involving 7110 Chinese participants (2436 were T2D patients) across 2885 families. Multilevel logistic regression was used to account for the intrafamilial correlation. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome significantly mediated the effect of a melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) polymorphism on T2D risk (OR of average causal mediation effect [ORACME ] 1.004; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.001-1.008; P = 0.018). In addition, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels mediated the genetic effects of MTNR1B (ORACME 1.012; 95% CI 1.007-1.015; P < 0.001), solute carrier family 30 member 8 (SLC30A8; ORACME 1.001; 95% CI 1.000-1.007; P < 0.040), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A; ORACME 1.009; 95% CI 1.007-1.016; P < 0.001), prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1; ORACME 1.005; 95% CI 1.003-1.011; P < 0.001) and a disintegrin and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 9 (ADAMTS9; ORACME 1.006; 95% CI 1.001-1.009; P = 0.022), whereas increased fasting blood glucose (FBG) significantly mediated the genetic effect of BCL11A (ORACME 1.017; 95% CI 1.003-1.021; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that MetS and two of its components (HDL-C, FBG) may be involved in mediating the genetic predisposition to T2D, which emphasize the importance of maintaining normal HDL-C and FBG levels.","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Program in Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Genetics, Harvard T.H.

Epub 2019 Jan 1.,"BACKGROUND: Trappin-2/pre-elafin is an endogenous inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase involved in inflammation, innate immunity and vascular remodelling, which consist of the complex pathological process of systemic sclerosis (SSc). OBJECTIVES: To clarify the potential role of trappin-2 in SSc. METHODS: Serum trappin-2 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 51 SSc and 18 healthy subjects. Trappin-2 expression was evaluated in SSc lesional skin and cultured endothelial cells treated with FLI1 siRNA by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-real-time PCR and/or immunoblotting. Friend leukaemia virus integration 1 (Fli1) binding to the PI3 promoter was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Since serum trappin-2 levels inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate in SSc patients with renal dysfunction, SSc patients with normal renal function were analysed. Although serum trappin-2 levels were comparable between diffuse cutaneous SSc, limited cutaneous SSc and control subjects, the prevalence of digital ulcers or elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was significantly higher in SSc patients with elevated serum trappin-2 levels than in those with normal levels. Furthermore, serum trappin-2 levels were significantly increased in SSc patients with digital ulcers or elevated RVSP compared to those without. Moreover, serum trappin-2 levels positively correlated with RVSP values in SSc patients. Importantly, trappin-2 expression was enhanced in small vessels of SSc lesional skin. In cultured endothelial cells, trappin-2 expression was elevated by gene silencing of FLI1 at mRNA and protein levels and Fli1 occupied the PI3 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial trappin-2 up-regulation partially due to Fli1 deficiency can be associated with the development of SSc vasculopathy.","['Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",,20190101,,,"['Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan']",,,,['(c) 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"Targeted therapy directed against rare disease-propagating leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) is a promising prospect for improving the outcome of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Thus, distinguishing LSCs from normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is essential. The CLEC12A receptor has been proposed as a specific marker of LSCs, and consequently as an appealing treatment target. To explore the role of CLEC12A in further detail, we investigated whether a sorting strategy based on the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase and CLEC12A expression could separate residual normal HSPCs from LSCs in bone marrow from 5 AML patients. We demonstrate that this distinction was possible in 2/5 cases, however with evidence of pre-leukaemic mutations in the CLEC12A- stem cells in one case. In contrast, cytogenetic and/or molecular aberrations were detected in both the CLEC12A+/- cell subsets in 3/5 AML cases studied. Furthermore, targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of the sorted cell subsets revealed a pronounced clonal heterogeneity in the CLEC12A- cells suggestive of the leukaemia often originating in this immature cell subset. In conclusion, we provide proof-of-concept that precision diagnostics employing targeted cytogenetic/NGS-based analyses on highly purified cell subsets could be a powerful tool for selecting patients eligible for LSC-directed therapy.","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Biochemistry, Lillebaelt Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9198-8266'],20181205,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the selection of specific aptamers is often unsatisfactory using the classical protein or cell-based SELEX. Herein, we modified the paired cell line approach to identify aptamers targeting leukemia cells expressing the CD33 antigen. Our strategy artfully used the same cells for negative (HEK293T cells) and positive (CD33 transfected-HEK293T cells) aptamer selections, and the negative selections were performed adequately before the positive selection to remove unspecific sequences. The advantages of this strategy are that it is fast and accurate, where only a few rounds of selection together with PCR amplifications are sufficient to obtain high binding affinity antigen-targeted aptamers. By using our modified approach, we successfully obtained the CD33-targeting aptamer S30, which could highly recognize the C2 domain of the CD33 antigen in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the optimized aptamer S30-T1 (i.e., core region of S30) was conjugated with doxorubicin (Dox) to synthesize S30-T1-Dox conjugates, which could specifically inhibit CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle at the G2 phase. Thus, our modified approach can rapidly screen reliable, stable and high binding affinity aptamers for precise cancer treatment.","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, P.R.

MDS result from genetic and epigenetic derangements in clonal cells and their surrounding microenvironments. Studies have shown associations between MDS and other autoimmune diseases. Several immune mechanisms have been identified in MDS, suggesting that immune dysregulation might be at least partially implicated in its pathogenesis. This has led to rigorous investigations on the role of immunomodulatory drugs as potential treatment options. Epigenetic modification via immune check point inhibition, while well established as a treatment method for advanced solid tumors, is a new approach being considered in hematologic malignancies including high risk MDS. Several trials are looking at the efficacy of these agents in MDS, as frontline therapy and in relapse, both as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs. In this review, we explore the utility of immune checkpoint inhibitors in MDS and current research evaluating their efficacy.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Waterbury Hospital, Waterbury, CT, USA.', 'Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Waterbury Hospital, Waterbury, CT, USA.', 'Medical University of Varna, Varna, Bulgaria.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2275-2508', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4727-9806']",20181101,,,,,PMC6241340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the role of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in the therapeutic response. Patients and methods: Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of 90 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with standard 3+7 regimen were analyzed through real-time PCR for expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, deoxycytidine kinase, cytidine deaminase (CDA), deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase (dCMPD) and topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo-IIa). The expression of these markers was studied in relationship with good (persistent remission) and poor therapeutic response (relapse/resistance). Results: High Topo-IIa expression in peripheral blood was associated with good response (P=0.006). Relapse was higher among low expressors of Topo-IIa in peripheral blood (OR: 26.25). Bone marrow Topo-IIa expression followed a similar trend but did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, patients with high bone marrow dCMPD expression had poor response (OR: 3; P=0.043). One-year disease-free survival (DFS) was better among those with high bone marrow Topo-IIa (P=0.04) or CDA (P=0.03) expression. High bone marrow Topo-IIa expression also had better DFS at 6 months (P=0.04) and at 12 months (P=0.04). Conclusion: High expression of Topo-IIa in peripheral blood is a favorable indicator of persistent remission, good therapeutic response and DFS. High dCMPD and low CDA expression in bone marrow is associated with poor therapeutic outcome.","['Center of Excellence in Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan, drknpk@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Jinnah Medical and Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan, drknpk@yahoo.com.', 'Center of Excellence in Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan, drknpk@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Jinnah Medical and Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan.']",,20181109,,,,,PMC6235003,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with early relapse (< 6 vs. > 6 months after haplo-HSCT), higher bone marrow blast count before chemo-DLI (> 20% vs. 5-19%), and without chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after chemo-DLI had a higher rate of progressive disease (PD) and worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, non-cGVHD after Chemo-DLI and high blast count predicted a higher risk of PD and poorer PFS, and non-cGVHD after Chemo-DLI and early relapse predicted poorer OS. The patients were stratified into three groups according to these three risk factors. Patients with all three risk factors (n = 14) had the highest PD rate and poorest survival compared with those with one or two risk factors (n = 63) or no risk factors (n = 12).

The latter is seen in patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and can be either donor-derived (DD-alloCAR) or recipient-derived (RD-alloCAR). While autoCAR is activated by CAR only, alloCAR receives activation signals from both T-cell receptor (TCR) and CAR. As a result, the biological differences could impact clinical outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients: 17 received autoCAR, 11 received RD-alloCAR, and 3 received DD-alloCAR. After a median follow-up of 9 months, CR rate was 88.2% (95% CI 63.6-98.5%) in autoCAR and 100% (95% CI 71.5-100%) in RD-alloCAR. The median peak expansion in the autoCAR was significantly higher than the RD-alloCAR group (p = 0.007). RD-alloCAR group had significantly less patients with severe CRS (Grade >/= 3) than the autoCAR group (p = 0.049). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 2 (18.2%) of RD-alloCAR patients and 1 (33.3%) of DD-alloCAR patients. Univariate subgroup analysis of alloCAR group showed the presence of cGVHD at the time of T-cell collection was significantly associated with less than 6-month relapses (p = 0.022).

Although a role of the skin microenvironment in SS pathogenesis has long been hypothesized, its function in vivo is poorly characterized. To deepen this aspect, here we compared skin to blood-derived SS cells concurrently obtained from SS patients highlighting a greater proliferation-index and a PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway activation level, particularly of mTOR protein, in skin-derived-SS cells. We proved that SDF-1 and CCL21 chemokines, both overexpressed in SS tissues, induce mTORC1 signaling activation, cell proliferation and Ki67 up-regulation in a SS-derived cell line and primary-SS cells. In a cohort of 43 SS cases, we observed recurrent copy number variations (CNV) of members belonging to this cascade, namely: loss of LKB1 (48%), PTEN (39%) and PDCD4 (35%) and gains of P70S6K (30%). These alterations represent druggable targets unraveling new therapeutic treatments as metformin here evaluated in vitro. Moreover, CNV of PTEN, PDCD4, and P70S6K, evaluated individually or in combination, are associated with reduced survival of SS patients. These data shed light on effects in vivo of skin-SS cells interaction underlying the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of mTORC1 pathway in SS.","[""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", 'Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, Fondazione Santa Lucia, 00143, Rome, Italy.', ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, University of Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy.', ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy. g.russo@idi.it."", ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, 00167, Rome, Italy. narducci@idi.it.""]",,20181205,,,,,PMC6756225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known regarding the functional role of Ars2 in cell proliferation and leukemogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we show that the elevated expression of Ars2 was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and bone marrow samples from AML patients and was correlated with poorer overall survival. Overexpression of Ars2 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in AML cells, whereas depletion of Ars2 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. Mechanistic studies reveal that depletion of Ars2 suppressed the interaction of Ars2 with CBC and led to alterations in miRNA processing. Furthermore, Ars2 depletion reduced the levels of miR-6734-3p, resulting in upregulation of p27 and culminating in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. In vivo studies indicate that depletion of Ars2 significantly reduced leukemic cell burden and prolonged the survival time of the leukemia-bearing mice. These findings indicate that Ars2 may not only play a crucial role in the regulation of cell proliferation and leukemogenesis, but could also be identified as a critical therapeutic target for treatment of AML.","['College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Greater Philadelphia Pharmacy, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China. chenjpxn@163.com.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China. gaoning59@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education and Joint International Research Laboratory of Ethnomedicine of Ministry of Education, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China. gaoning59@163.com.']",,20181205,,,,,PMC6756072,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential roles of the miR-29 family in methotrexate (MTX) resistance in osteosarcoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two MTX-resistant osteosarcoma cell lines, MG-63/MTX and U2OS/MTX, were generated by continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of MTX. miR-29abc, COL3A1, and MCL1 mRNA expression levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein expression levels of COL3A1 and MCL1 were detected by Western blot. Cell viability, IC50 value, and cell apoptosis were assessed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The target relationship between the miR-29 family and COL3A1 or MCL1 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c were significantly downregulated in MG-63/MTX and U2OS/MTX cells and in chemotherapy poor-response osteosarcoma tissues. Overexpression of the miR-29 family sensitized MG-63/MTX and U2OS/MTX cells to MTX and obviously promoted cell apoptosis compared with negative control. COL3A1 and MCL1 were identified to be target genes of the miR-29 family, and transfection with miR-29abc mimics in MG-63/MTX and U2OS/MTX cells decreased COL3A1 and MCL1 mRNA and protein expression. Meanwhile, overexpression of COL3A1 and MCL1 partly neutralized the effects of the miR-29 family on MTX resistance and cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our findings suggested a tumor-suppressor role of the miR-29 family in control of MTX resistance and cell apoptosis through regulating COL3A1 or MCL1. Targeting the miR-29 family might provide new strategies to overcome the high-dosage MTX-induced cytotoxicity in osteosarcoma treatment.","['Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'TongRen Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', 'TongRen Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', 'TongRen Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', 'TongRen Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland).']",,20181206,,,,,PMC6292150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"PURPOSE: Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) regulates several biological processes via the bifunctional modulation of enhancer functions. Recently, we reported that LSD1 overexpression is a founder abnormality of T-cell leukemogenesis and is maintained in fully transformed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. On the basis of this finding, we attempted to develop novel LSD1 inhibitors effective for T-ALL with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We chemically modified the prototype LSD inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP) and screened for cytotoxicity against TCP-resistant T-ALL cell lines. In vivo efficacy of novel LSD1 inhibitors was examined in immunodeficient mice transplanted with luciferase-expressing T-ALL cell lines, which faithfully reproduce human T-ALL with CNS involvement. RESULTS: We found robust cytotoxicity against T-ALL cells, but not normal bone marrow progenitors, for two N-alkylated TCP derivatives, S2116 and S2157. The two compounds induced apoptosis in TCP-resistant T-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo by repressing transcription of the NOTCH3 and TAL1 genes through increased H3K9 methylation and reciprocal H3K27 deacetylation at superenhancer regions. Both S2116 and S2157 significantly retarded the growth of T-ALL cells in xenotransplanted mice and prolonged the survival of recipients as monotherapy and in combination with dexamethasone. Notably, S2157 could almost completely eradicate CNS leukemia because of its ability to efficiently pass through the blood-brain barrier. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a molecular basis and rationale for the inclusion of a brain-permeable LSD1 inhibitor, S2157, in treatment strategies for T-ALL with CNS involvement.","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Epigenetics Drug Discovery Unit, RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Chemistry Platform Unit, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Epigenetics Drug Discovery Unit, RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan. furuyu@jichi.ac.jp.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4134-4286', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4134-4286', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7249-6418']",20181205,,,['HHSN263201100009C/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6397674,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS1515965'],,,,,,,,,

Print 2019 Feb.,"During human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection, the frequency of cells harboring an integrated copy of viral cDNA, the proviral load (PVL), is the main risk factor for progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Accurate quantification of provirus by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a powerful diagnostic tool with emerging uses for monitoring viral expression. Current ddPCR techniques quantify HTLV-1 PVL in terms of whole genomic cellular material, while the main targets of HTLV-1 infection are CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Our understanding of HTLV-1 proliferation and the amount of viral burden present in different compartments is limited. Recently a sensitive ddPCR assay was applied to quantifying T cells by measuring loss of germ line T-cell receptor genes as method of distinguishing non-T-cell from recombined T-cell DNA. In this study, we demonstrated and validated novel applications of the duplex ddPCR assay to quantify T cells from various sources of human genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from frozen material (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs], bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and induced sputum) from a cohort of remote Indigenous Australians and then compared the T-cell measurements by ddPCR to the prevailing standard method of flow cytometry. The HTLV-1 subtype c (HTLV-1c) PVL was then calculated in terms of extracted T-cell gDNA from various compartments. Because HTLV-1c preferentially infects CD4(+) T cells, and the amount of viral burden correlates with HTLV-1c disease pathogenesis, application of this ddPCR assay to accurately measure HTLV-1c-infected T cells can be of greater importance for clinical diagnostics and prognostics as well as monitoring therapeutic applications.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Alice Springs, NT, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Alice Springs, NT, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, NT, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia dfjp@unimelb.edu.au.']",,20190130,,,,,PMC6355533,,['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MSCs are functionally altered in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and exhibit an altered methylome compared with MSCs from healthy controls, thus contributing to disease progression. To determine whether MSCs are amenable to epigenetic therapy and if this affects their function, we examined growth, differentiation, and HSPC-supporting capacity of ex vivo-expanded MSCs from MDS patients in comparison with age-matched healthy controls after direct treatment in vitro with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA). Strikingly, we find that AZA exerts a direct effect on healthy as well as MDS-derived MSCs such that they favor support of healthy over malignant clonal HSPC expansion in coculture experiments. RNA-sequencing analyses of MSCs identified stromal networks regulated by AZA. Notably, these comprise distinct molecular pathways crucial for HSPC support, foremost extracellular matrix molecules (including collagens) and interferon pathway components. Our study demonstrates that the hypomethylating agent AZA exerts its antileukemic activity in part through a direct effect on the HSPC-supporting BM niche and provides proof of concept for the therapeutic potential of epigenetic treatment of diseased MSCs. In addition, our comprehensive data set of AZA-sensitive gene networks represents a valuable framework to guide future development of targeted epigenetic niche therapy in myeloid malignancies such as MDS and acute myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germany Trias I Pujol-Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'German Cancer Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'German Cancer Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germany Trias I Pujol-Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'German Cancer Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3920-7490', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6276-8002']",,,,,,PMC6290099,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 2.,"BACKGROUND: Axicabtagene ciloleucel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. In the previous analysis of the ZUMA-1 registrational study, with a median follow-up of 15.4 months (IQR 13.7-17.3), 89 (82%) of 108 assessable patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved an objective response, and complete responses were noted in 63 (58%) patients. Here we report long-term activity and safety outcomes of the ZUMA-1 study. METHODS: ZUMA-1 is a single-arm, multicentre, registrational trial at 22 sites in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphoma-including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma-according to the 2008 WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue; refractory disease or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing-regimen and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Participants received one dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel on day 0 at a target dose of 2 x 10(6) CAR T cells per kg of bodyweight after conditioning chemotherapy with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) body-surface area) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m(2) body-surface area) on days -5, -4, and -3. The primary endpoints were safety for phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase 2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02348216. Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway. FINDINGS: Between May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2. As of the cutoff date of Aug 11, 2018, 101 patients assessable for activity in phase 2 were followed up for a median of 27.1 months (IQR 25.7-28.8), 84 (83%) had an objective response, and 59 (58%) had a complete response. The median duration of response was 11.1 months (4.2-not estimable). The median overall survival was not reached (12.8-not estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 5.9 months (95% CI 3.3-15.0). 52 (48%) of 108 patients assessable for safety in phases 1 and 2 had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events. Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in 12 (11%) patients, and grade 3 or worse neurological events in 35 (32%). Since the previous analysis at 1 year, additional serious adverse events were reported in four patients (grade 3 mental status changes, grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, grade 3 lung infection, and two episodes of grade 3 bacteraemia), none of which were judged to be treatment related. Two treatment-related deaths (due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest) were previously reported, but no new treatment-related deaths occurred during the additional follow-up. INTERPRETATION: These 2-year follow-up data from ZUMA-1 suggest that axicabtagene ciloleucel can induce durable responses and a median overall survival of greater than 2 years, and has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"BACKGROUND: Outcomes of relapsed/refractory childhood acute leukemia remain poor. We analyzed the safety/efficacy of fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor, with/without idarubicin (FLAG +/- IDA) as salvage therapy compared with recent published results of novel therapies. METHODS: This retrospective study included children aged 1 to 15 years with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia who received FLAG +/- IDA salvage therapy from January 2000 to December 2014. Patients with infant leukemia, mixed lineage leukemia, Philadelphia-positive acute leukemia, or secondary leukemia were excluded. RESULT: Fifty patients were identified: 25 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 25 with acute myeloid leukemia. The median age at initiation of FLAG +/- IDA was seven years. Site of relapse was the bone marrow in 29, isolated central nervous system in 11, and combined in 10 patients. FLAG +/- IDA was used after first relapse in 68% and after multiple relapses in 32%. Complete remission was achieved in 34 (68%) patients. No variables predictive of complete remission were identified. Grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed in 96% and 6% died from toxicity. Toxicities included hematologic toxicity (96%), infection (52%), and enterocolitis (28%). Twenty-four of 50 (48%) patients achieved a sustained complete remission and survived to bone marrow transplantation. The five-year overall survival was 23.9% +/- 6.9%. Patients achieving second complete remission and patients proceeding to bone marrow transplantation following second complete remission demonstrated significantly improved overall survival (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite a 68% complete remission rate using FLAG +/- IDA, only 48% of patients survived to bone marrow transplantation. The regimen was associated with 96% toxicity and only one in four patients was alive at five years. This underscores the need to find more effective lower toxicity salvage regimens.","['Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care, Clinical Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm AlQura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2495-8796', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2761-7559']",20181205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this work was to investigate the efficacy and predictive factors of CLAG treatment in refractory or relapsed (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. METHODS: Sixty-seven R/R AML patients were enrolled in this prospective cohort study and treated by a CLAG regimen: 5 mg/m2/day cladribine (days 1-5), 2 g/m2/day cytarabine (days 1-5), and 300 mug/day filgrastim (days 0-5). The median follow-up duration was 10 months. RESULTS: A total of 57 out of 67 patients were evaluable for remission after CLAG therapy, of whom 57.9% achieved a complete remission (CR) and the overall remission rate was 77.2%. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.0 months, with a 1-year OS of 40.3 +/- 6.0% and 3-year OS of 16.7 +/- 5.7%. CR at first induction after the initial diagnosis was associated with a favorable CR. Age above 60 years, high risk stratification, second or higher salvage therapy, and bone marrow (BM) blasts >/=42.1% were correlated with an unfavorable CR. Secondary disease, age >/=60 years, high risk stratification, and second or higher salvage therapy were associated with worse OS. Patients developed thrombocytopenia (41, 61%), febrile neutropenia (37, 55%), leukopenia (33, 49%), neutropenia (18, 27%), and anemia (9, 13%). CONCLUSION: CLAG was effective and well tolerated for R/R AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with ALL treated with chemotherapy in a Peruvian hospital for 13 years was studied. The dependent variables were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Possible factors that might be associated with diagnosis and response to treatment were evaluated using the Cox proportional risk method. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 32.5% and the relapse rate was 66.1%. The factors associated with lower overall survival were leukocyte count at diagnosis (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), lineage other than B (HR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1,06-4,41), age at diagnosis (HR: 1,09; 95% CI: 1,03-1,16), bone marrow relapse (HR: 6,81; 95% CI: 4,14- 11,21) and induction failure (HR: 3,04; 95% CI: 1,47-6,32). Factors associated with lower disease-free survival: male gender (HR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.10-1.86), age at diagnosis (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02-1.10) and leukocytes at diagnosis (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.002-1.011). CONCLUSIONS: The five-year OS and DFS figures for our population are lower than those for the world. More studies are needed to know the factors involved in this reality and thus generate interventions aimed at improving the survival and quality of life of our patients. The variables associated with the decrease in both survival indicators were age and leukocyte count at the time of diagnosis, so the process of disease diagnosis must be improved.","['.

Epub 2018 Dec 28.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection carries increased risks for morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but has become curable through the advent of directly acting antiviral compounds. Current guidelines of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) recommend that HCV-infected HSCT candidates preferably start and complete therapy prior to transplant. However, this is often not feasible due to time constraints or treatment-limiting comorbidities, conditions and treatments. For these reasons, data on the safety of antiviral treatment, its efficacy to achieve durable eradication of the virus until full immune recovery, and late effects of former HCV infection in patients receiving HSCT are unknown. Here, we report the course of two paediatric patients with chronic HCV infection who received a full course of directly acting antivirals prior to allogeneic HSCT and achieved and maintained viral eradication throughout transplantation until complete immune recovery.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Department of General Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1188-393X'],20181228,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"JAK2 mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are associated with the germline GGCC (46/1) haplotype. In 2010, we reported an association between shortened survival in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and nullizygosity for the JAK2 46/1 haplotype. In the current study, we have increased the number of informative cases from 130 to 414 (median age 63 years; 63% males), in order to revisit with the phenotypic and prognostic relevance of the JAK2 46/1 haplotype in PMF. JAK2 46/1 haplotype was documented in 69% of the study patients, including 25% in homozygous and 44% in heterozygous state. Driver mutation frequency in patients homozygous/heterozygous/nullizygous for the 46/1 haplotype was 78%/60%/56% JAK2, 10%/20%/18% type 1-like CALR, 3%/2%/5% type 2-like CALR, 4%/8%/7% MPL, and 6%/10%/14% triple-negative (P = .02). In univariate analysis, nullizygosity for the JAK2 46/1 haplotype was associated with inferior overall survival (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), most pronounced in JAK2 (P <.001), as opposed to CALR/MPL mutated (P = .48) or triple-negative cases (P = .27). Multivariable analysis that included karyotype, driver mutational status and high-molecular risk mutations confirmed the independent prognostic contribution of nullizygosity for the 46/1 haplotype (P = .02; HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8). Nullizygosity for 46/1 also remained significant in the context of the genetically-inspired GIPSS risk model (P = .04), but not in the context of the integrated genetics-clinical MIPSS70+ version 2.0 model (P = .4). Leukemia-free survival was not affected by the 46/1 haplotype (P = .6). The current study confirms the association of nullizygosity for the JAK2 GGCC (46/1) haplotype with inferior survival in JAK2-mutated PMF.","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4605-3821', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0550-8933', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9104-6172']",20181205,['Am J Hematol. 2019 Mar;94(3):283-285.

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"BACKGROUND: The European Neuroblastoma Study Group 5 (ENSG5) trial showed that time-intensive ""rapid"" induction chemotherapy (COJEC) was superior to ""standard"" 3-weekly chemotherapy for children with high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma. Long-term outcomes of the ENSG5 trial were analysed. PROCEDURE: Patients with metastatic neuroblastoma aged >/=12 months were randomly assigned to ""standard"" or ""rapid"" induction, receiving the same chemotherapy drugs and doses. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed and prognostic factors evaluated. Amongst patients surviving >5 years, a population of children with persistent metastatic disease after the end of treatment was identified and described. RESULTS: Ten-year EFS was 18.2% (95% confidence interval: 12.2-25.2) for the ""standard"" arm and 26.8% (19.5-34.7) for the ""rapid"" arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, P = 0.28). Ten-year OS for the ""standard"" arm was 19.7% (13.4-26.8) and 28.3% (20.8-36.2) for the ""rapid arm"" (HR 0.83, P = 0.19). There was a trend for worse EFS and OS for patients having MYCN amplification (HR 1.37 and 1.40, respectively) and those with partial and mixed response to induction (HR 1.69 and 1.75 for EFS and 1.66 and 2.00 for OS, respectively). Among 69 patients who survived >5 years, six had persistent metastatic disease after the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: The benefit of the ""rapid"" induction regimen seems to be maintained in the long term, although the small number of survivors could justify the lack of statistical significance. MYCN amplification and poor metastatic response to induction could be associated with worse outcomes. A small group of patients with persistent metastatic disease that survived long term has been described.","['Clinical Trials Unit, Department of, Paediatric Haematology, Oncology and SCT, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', ""Children and Young People's Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, United Kingdom."", 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""Children and Young People's Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, United Kingdom."", ""Children and Young People's Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, United Kingdom."", ""Hummingbird House Children's Hospice, Brisbane, Australia."", 'Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, Clinical Sciences Building, Leicester Royal Infirmary, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.', ""Children and Young People's Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, United Kingdom (retired).""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0708-1670'],20181205,,,"['DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'C347/A15403/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,"[""European Neuroblastoma Study Group and the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group"", '(CCLG) (formerly UKCCSG)']",,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the STAT5-related miRNA-expression profile in CML cell lines (K562 and imatinib-resistant K562/G) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reactions. MiR-221 expression was markedly decreased in K562/G cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with treatment failure, when compared to imatinib-sensitive CML cells and patients with optimal responses respectively. We also observed the expression of STAT5 inversely correlated with miR-221 expression in K562 and KBM5 cells. Additionally, STAT5 was validated as a direct target of miR-221 in dual-luciferase reporter vector assays. MiR-221 restoration and STAT5 knockdown in K562/G cells increased the sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib by reducing the Bcl2: Bax ratio.

In this review, we highlight evidence for RUNX1 control in both invertebrate and mammalian development and recent novel findings of perturbed RUNX1 control in breast cancer that has implications for other solid tumors. As RUNX1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis, RUNX1 mutations in hematopoietic lineage cells have been implicated in the etiology of several leukemias. Studies of solid tumors have revealed a context-dependent function for RUNX1 either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. These RUNX1 functions have been reported for breast, prostate, lung, and skin cancers that are related to cancer subtypes and different stages of tumor development. Growing evidence suggests that RUNX1 suppresses aggressiveness in most breast cancer subtypes particularly in the early stage of tumorigenesis. Several studies have identified RUNX1 suppression of the breast cancer epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Most recently, RUNX1 repression of cancer stem cells and tumorsphere formation was reported for breast cancer. It is anticipated that these new discoveries of the context-dependent diversity of RUNX1 functions will lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for the intervention of cancer and other abnormalities of normal tissues.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biomedical and Health Sciences, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Pediatrics, UMass Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Graduate Program in Cell Biology and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, UMass Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2220-9943', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0985-9447', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4458-0946', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8762-5422']",20181204,,,"['F32 CA220935/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM115516/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DE012528/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM118228/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR021905/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA196383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139322/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6395522,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS999830'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Leukemia is known as a progressive malignant disease, which destroys the blood-forming organs and results in adverse effects on the proliferation and development of leukocytes and their precursors in the blood and bone marrow. There are four main classes of leukemia including acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, myelogenous leukemia, and lymphocytic leukemia. Given that a variety of internal and external factors could be associated with the initiation and progression of different types of leukemia. One of the important factors is epigenetic regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (ncRNA). MiRNAs are short ncRNAs which act as tumor suppressor (i.e., miR-15, miR-16, let-7, and miR-127) or oncogene (i.e., miR-155, miR-17-92, miR-21, miR-125b, miR-93, miR-143-p3, miR-196b, and miR-223) in leukemia. It has been shown that deregulation of these molecules are associated with the initiation and progression of leukemia. Hence, miRNAs could be used as potential therapeutic candidates in the treatment of patients with leukemia. Moreover, increasing evidence revealed that miRNAs could be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in monitoring patients in early stages of disease or after received chemotherapy regimen. It seems that identification and development of new miRNAs could pave to the way to the development new therapeutic platforms for patients with leukemia. Here, we summarized various miRNAs as tumor suppressor and oncogene which could be introduced as therapeutic targets in treatment of leukemia.","['Department of Biochemistry, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Borujen, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, College of Science, Kish International Campus, University of Tehran, Kish, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medical Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Student Research Committee, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7882-7601'],20181204,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"An epigenetic modulator Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1) is recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). ASXL1 mutations are also frequently detected in clonal hematopoiesis with indeterminate potential (CHIP), which is the clonal expansion of premalignant hematopoietic cells without any evidence of hematological malignancies. Thus, understanding the roles of ASXL1 in hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasms is a clinically crucial issue. ASXL1 mutations in hematological neoplasms are typically frameshift or nonsense mutations and occur near the 5' end of the last exon, thereby the transcripts would escape from nonsense-mediated decay, Indeed, we identified the C-terminally truncated mutant protein of ASXL1 in several cell lines derived from patients with myeloid leukemia. In mouse models, expression of the mutant ASXL1 results in impaired hematopoiesis and promotes development of myeloid neoplasms. In addition, recent findings from biochemical analysis have demonstrated that the mutant ASXL1 protein gains new functions including enhancing catalytic activity of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), resulting in reduction of H2AK119ub and aberrant gene expression essential for myeloid transformation. In this review, we will focus on the pivotal roles of the mutant ASXL1 on histone modifications and myeloid transformation.","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 1088639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 1088639, Japan. kitamura@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",,20181205,,,"['15H04855/a Grant-in-Aid Scientific Research B from the Ministry of Education,', 'Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Current prognostication in myelofibrosis (MF) is based on clinicopathological features and mutations in a limited number of driver genes. The impact of other genetic mutations remains unclear. We evaluated for mutations in a myeloid panel of 54 genes using next-generation sequencing. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS), based on mutations of these genes and relevant clinical and haematological features. One hundred and one patients (primary MF, N = 70; secondary MF, N = 31) with a median follow-up of 49 (1-256) months were studied. For the entire cohort, inferior OS was associated with male gender (P = 0.04), age > 65 years (P = 0.04), haemoglobin < 10 g/dL (P = 0.001), CUX1 mutation (P = 0.003) and TP53 mutation (P = 0.049); and inferior LFS was associated with male gender (P = 0.03), haemoglobin < 10 g/dL (P = 0.04) and SRSF2 mutations (P = 0.008). In primary MF, inferior OS was associated with male gender (P = 0.03), haemoglobin < 10 g/dL (P = 0.002), platelet count < 100 x 10(9)/L (P = 0.02), TET2 mutation (P = 0.01) and CUX1 mutation (P = 0.01); and inferior LFS was associated with haemoglobin < 10 g/dL (P = 0.02), platelet count < 100 x 10(9)/L (P = 0.02), TET2 mutations (P = 0.01) and CUX1 mutations (P = 0.04). These results showed that clinical and haematological features and genetic mutations should be considered in MF prognostication.","['Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'The Department of Infectious Diseases and Public Health, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Systems Biology Group, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans Knoll Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk.', 'Department of Medicine, Professorial Block, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8156-6978'],20181204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the requirement of polyamines in tumor cells is stepped up to maintain tumorigenicity. Many synthetic polyamine analogues have been designed recently to target the polyamine metabolism in tumors to induce apoptosis. N(4)-Erucoyl spermidine (designed as N(4)-Eru), a novel acylspermidine derivative, has been shown to exert selective inhibitory effects on both hematological and solid tumors, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the anticancer mechanisms of N(4)-Eru-treated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line (Jurkat cells), and gene expression was examined through different tools. We could show that many key oncogenes including NDRG1, CACNA1G, TGFBR2, NOTCH1,2,3, UHRF1, DNMT1,3, HDAC1,3, KDM3A, KDM4B, KDM4C, FOS, and SATB1 were downregulated, whereas several tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2AIPNL, KISS1, DDIT3, TP53I13, PPARG, FOXP1 were upregulated. Data obtained through RNA-Seq further showed that N(4)-Eru inhibited the NOTCH/Wnt/JAK-STAT axis. This study also indicated that N(4)-Eru-induced apoptosis could involve several key signaling pathways in cancer. Altogether, our results suggest that N(4)-Eru is a promising drug to treat ALL.","['Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer and Mutagenesis Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Experimental Biochemistry Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Hadhramout University, Mukalla, Yemen.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Experimental Biochemistry Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Bioactive Natural Products Research Group, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Experimental Biochemistry Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Bioactive Natural Products Research Group, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer and Mutagenesis Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Experimental Biochemistry Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Production of Bioproducts for Industrial Applications Research Group, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Experimental Biochemistry Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Bioactive Natural Products Research Group, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Nanomedicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U1258 CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.', 'Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U1258 CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.', 'Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U1258 CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer and Mutagenesis Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",,20181127,,,,,PMC6262497,"['Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared the following', 'potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article: The authors have no relevant affiliations or', 'financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest', 'in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the', 'manuscript.

Sporadic missing data were multiply imputed, and hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard. Age- and sex-adjusted analysis for patients >/=10 years showed a trend towards increased risk of relapse for overweight/obese patients (HR = 2.89, 95% CI = 0.89-9.36, p=0.08) that was not evident among children<10 years (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.08-3.54, p=0.49).

Recent studies have shown alterations in alternative splicing, resulting in loss, gain or changes of functions in the resulting protein. Specific products of alternative splicing are known to contribute in cancer-related mechanisms, such as angiogenesis, migration, adhesion and cell proliferation, among others. We using high-density microarrays reported a CENP-E as a one of significant transcript expressed and potentially is alternatively spliced in cancer. We focus in validate alternative splicing of CENP-E transcript using RT-PCR and sequencing in different cancer cell lines. We performed RT-PCR using specific primers designed to delimit the non-reported alternative splicing in CENP-E transcript. Our results showed the co-expression of the variant one and two of CENP-E in all cell lines evaluated. We detected more expression of variant one than two. Moreover, we identify an alternative 5'splice site of CENP-E in the exon 38 and was observed in RoVa cell line. Additionally, we characterized alternative skipping from exon 20 (NAT-CENP-E), these alternative splicing was observed in all cell lines evaluated except RoVa. Finally, we corroborate alternative mRNA splicing in leukemia patients using quantitative RT-PCR, in 71.8% of the patients NAT-CENP-E is downregulated and 28.2% is overexpressed.","['Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Genetics Department-Research Unit, Institute of Ophthalmology, ""Conde de Valenciana"" Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Department, National Institute of Pediatrics Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Genetics Department-Research Unit, Institute of Ophthalmology, ""Conde de Valenciana"" Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, UNAM Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics Mexico City, Mexico.']",,20181020,,,,,PMC6261922,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosome 21 (HSA21) encodes two microRNAs (miRs), miR-125b, and miR-155, that regulate B-cell responses. We studied B- and T- cell subpopulations in tonsils of DS and age-matched healthy donors (HD) and found that the germinal center (GC) reaction was impaired in DS. GC size, numbers of GC B cells and Follicular Helper T cells (TFH) expressing BCL6 cells were severely reduced. The expression of miR-155 and miR-125b was increased in tonsillar memory B cells and miR-125b was also higher than expected in plasma cells (PCs). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) protein, a miR-155 target, was significantly reduced in MBCs of DS patients. Increased expression of miR-155 was also observed in vitro. MiR-155 was significantly overexpressed in PBMCs activated with CpG, whereas miR-125b was constitutively higher than normal. The increase of miR-155 and its functional consequences were blocked by antagomiRs in vitro. Our data show that the expression of HSA21-encoded miR-155 and miR-125b is altered in B cells of DS individuals both in vivo and in vitro. Because of HSA21-encoded miRs may play a role also in DS-associated dementia and leukemia, our study suggests that antagomiRs may represent pharmacological tools useful for the treatment of DS.","[""B cell Pathophysiology Unit, Immunology Research Area, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Division of Rheumatology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Research Laboratories, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Research Laboratories, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Pediatric and Infectious Disease Unit, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Research Laboratories, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Research Laboratories, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Research Laboratories, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""B cell Pathophysiology Unit, Immunology Research Area, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Research Laboratories, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Unit of Otolaryngology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""B cell Pathophysiology Unit, Immunology Research Area, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""B cell Pathophysiology Unit, Immunology Research Area, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Unit of Diagnostic Immunology, Department of Laboratories, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""]",,20181120,,,,,PMC6255899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among environmental risk factors, parental occupational exposures have attracted scientific interest as potential predisposing factors for childhood leukemia. The role of parental occupational exposure to social contacts, harmful chemicals, electromagnetic fields and ionizing radiation has been investigated with conflicting and inconsistent results. Aim: A case-control study aiming to assess the association between parental occupational exposures to social contacts, chemicals and electromagnetic fields and the risk of offspring acute leukemia. Material and Methods: 108 children with acute leukemia and equal number of matched controls were included. Data on parental occupations before conception, during pregnancy, during breastfeeding and after birth, and on potential risk factors was recorded. Associations between parental exposure and risk of childhood leukemia were estimated. Results: Parental occupational exposure during the four periods of exposure was not associated with childhood leukemia. High birth weight and family history of cancer were associated with the development of childhood acute leukemia. A weak association of maternal medication use during pregnancy and leukemia risk emerged. Conclusions: Since the causative factors of childhood leukemia remain unknown, further investigation is mandatory for the reduction of disease burden.","['Occupational and Industrial Hygiene Department, National School of Public Health, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.', 'Quality Assurance and Continuing Education Unit, General Hospital of Lamia, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, 401 General Military Hospital of Athens, Greece.', 'Research Biologist, Principal Investigator.', 'Occupational and Industrial Hygiene Department, National School of Public Health, Athens, Greece.']",,,,,,,PMC6195413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The task is challenging because tumors evolve as heterogeneous cell populations. Single-cell sequencing holds the promise of resolving the heterogeneity of tumors; however, it has its own challenges including elevated error rates, allelic drop-out, and uneven coverage. Here, we develop a new approach to mutation detection in individual tumor cells by leveraging the evolutionary relationship among cells. Our method, called SCIPhi, jointly calls mutations in individual cells and estimates the tumor phylogeny among these cells. Employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme enables us to reliably call mutations in each single cell even in experiments with high drop-out rates and missing data. We show that SCIPhi outperforms existing methods on simulated data and applied it to different real-world datasets, namely a whole exome breast cancer as well as a panel acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset.","['Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, 4058, Basel, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, 4058, Basel, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, 4058, Basel, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, 4058, Basel, Switzerland. niko.beerenwinkel@bsse.ethz.ch.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland. niko.beerenwinkel@bsse.ethz.ch.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0001-8625', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0573-6119']",20181204,,,,,PMC6279798,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-tumor activity of GSK2879552 and GSK-LSD1, potent, selective irreversible inactivators of LSD1, has previously been described. Inhibition of LSD1 results in a cytostatic growth inhibitory effect in a range of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. To enhance the therapeutic potential of LSD1 inhibition in this disease setting, a combination of LSD1 inhibition and all-trans retinoic acid was explored. All-trans retinoic acid is currently approved for use in acute promyelocytic leukemia in which it promotes differentiation of abnormal blast cells into normal white blood cells. Combined treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and GSK2879552 results in synergistic effects on cell proliferation, markers of differentiation, and, most importantly, cytotoxicity. Ultimately the combination potential for LSD1 inhibition and ATRA will require validation in acute myeloid leukemia patients, and clinical studies to assess this are currently underway.","['Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Oncode Institute, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Target Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Target Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Target Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Target Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Oncode Institute, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Modeling Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Oncode Institute, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Faculty of EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.', 'Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA helai.x.mohammad@gsk.com.']",,20181204,,,,,PMC6545850,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Standard first-line therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia is treatment with imatinib. In the randomized German Chronic Myeloid Leukemia-Study IV, more potent BCR-ABL inhibition with 800 mg ('high-dose') imatinib accelerated achievement of a deep molecular remission. However, whether and when a de-escalation of the dose intensity under high-dose imatinib can be safely performed without increasing the risk of losing deep molecular response is unknown. To gain insights into this clinically relevant question, we analyzed the outcome of imatinib dose reductions from 800 mg to 400 mg daily in the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia-Study IV. Of the 422 patients that were randomized to the 800 mg arm, 68 reduced imatinib to 400 mg after they had achieved at least a stable major molecular response. Of these 68 patients, 61 (90%) maintained major molecular remission on imatinib at 400 mg. Five of the seven patients who lost major molecular remission on the imatinib standard dose regained major molecular remission while still on 400 mg imatinib. Only two of 68 patients had to switch to more potent kinase inhibition to regain major molecular remission. Importantly, the lengths of the intervals between imatinib high-dose treatment before and after achieving major molecular remission were associated with the probabilities of maintaining major molecular remission with the standard dose of imatinib. Taken together, the data support the view that a deep molecular remission achieved with high-dose imatinib can be safely maintained with standard dose in most patients.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, TP53 mutations and deletion of chromosome 17p are well-characterized biomarkers associated with poor progression-free and overall survival following chemoimmunotherapy. Patients harboring low burden TP53 mutations with variant allele frequencies of 0.3-15% have been shown to have similar dismal outcome as those with high burden mutations. We here describe a highly sensitive deep targeted next-generation sequencing assay allowing for the detection of TP53 mutations as low as 0.2% variant allele frequency. Within a consecutive, single center cohort of 290 newly diagnosed patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, deletion of chromosome 17p was the only TP53 aberration significantly associated with shorter overall survival and treatment-free survival. We were unable to demonstrate any impact of TP53 mutations, whether high burden (variant allele frequency >10%) or low burden (variant allele frequency </=10%), in the absence of deletion of chromosome 17p. In addition, the impact of high burden TP53 aberration (deletion of chromosome 17p and/or TP53 mutation with variant allele frequency >10%) was only evident for patients with IGHV unmutated status; no impact of TP53 aberrations on outcome was seen for patients with IGHV mutated status. In 61 patients at time of treatment, the prognostic impact of TP53 mutations over 1% variant allele frequency could be confirmed. This study furthers the identification of a clinical significant limit of detection for robust TP53 mutation analysis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Multicenter studies are needed for validation of ultra-sensitive TP53 mutation assays in order to define and implement a technical as well as a clinical lower limit of detection.","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet carsten.utoft.niemann@regionh.dk.']",,20181204,,,,,PMC6442964,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Survivorship Care Plans (SCPs) may facilitate long-term care for cancer survivors, but their effectiveness has not been established in hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients. We evaluated the impact of individualized SCPs on patient-reported outcomes among transplant survivors. Adult (>/=18 years at transplant) survivors who were 1-5 years post transplantation, proficient in English, and without relapse or secondary cancers were eligible for this multicenter randomized trial. SCPs were developed based on risk-factors and treatment exposures using patient data routinely submitted by transplant centers to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research and published guidelines for long-term follow up of transplant survivors. Phone surveys assessing patient-reported outcomes were conducted at baseline and at 6 months. The primary end point was confidence in survivorship information, and secondary end points included cancer and treatment distress, knowledge of transplant exposures, health care utilization, and health-related quality of life. Of 495 patients enrolled, 458 completed a baseline survey and were randomized (care plan=231, standard care=227); 200 (87%) and 199 (88%) completed the 6-month assessments, respectively. Patients' characteristics were similar in the two arms. Participants on the care plan arm reported significantly lower distress scores at 6 months and an increase in the Mental Component Summary quality of life score assessed by the Short Form 12 (SF-12) instrument. No effect was observed on the end point of confidence in survivorship information or other secondary outcomes.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a chronic disease resulting in myeloid cell expansion through expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have significantly increased survival of patients with CML, and deep responders may consider stopping the treatment. However, more than 50% of patients relapse and restart TKI, subsequently suffering unknown toxicity. Because CML is a model immune system-sensitive disease, we hypothesize that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting IL1 receptor-associated protein (IL1RAP) in quiescent CML stem cells may offer an opportunity for a permanent cure. In this study, we produced and molecularly characterized a specific monoclonal anti-IL1RAP antibody from which fragment antigen-binding nucleotide coding sequences were cloned as a single chain into a lentiviral backbone and secured with the suicide gene iCASP9/rimiducid system. Our CAR T-cell therapy exhibited cytotoxicity against both leukemic stem cells and, to a lesser extent, monocytes expressing IL1RAP, with no apparent effect on the hematopoietic system, including CD34(+) stem cells. This suggests IL1RAP as a tumor-associated antigen for immunotherapy cell targeting. IL1RAP CAR T cells were activated in the presence of IL1RAP(+) cell lines or primary CML cells, resulting in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and specifically killing in vitro and in a xenograft murine model. Overall, we demonstrate the proof of concept of a CAR T-cell immunotherapy approach in the context of CML that is applicable for young patients and primary TKI-resistant, intolerant, or allograft candidate patients. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings present the first characterization and proof of concept of a chimeric antigen receptor directed against IL1RAP expressed by leukemic stem cells in the context of CML.","['INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'Laboratory of Applied Biotechnology, Azm Centre for Research in Biotechnology and its Applications, EDST and Faculty of Sciences 3, Lebanese University, Tripoli, Liban.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'Laboratory of Applied Biotechnology, Azm Centre for Research in Biotechnology and its Applications, EDST and Faculty of Sciences 3, Lebanese University, Tripoli, Liban.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Haute Saone, Vesoul, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Dijon, Dijon, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Nord Franche-Comte, Belfort, France.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'Transcure, Biopark, Archamps Technopole, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'INSERM UMR1098, EFS BFC, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France. christophe.ferrand@efs.sante.fr.']",,20181204,,,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains one of the major complications after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1) plays a crucial role in various biological processes including cellular senescence, metabolism, and inflammatory responses. Sirt-1 deacetylation regulates different transcription factors that are important for modulating immune responses. In the current study, we addressed the role of Sirt-1 in GVHD induction by employing Sirt-1 conditional knockout mice as well as a pharmacological Sirt-1 inhibitor. Using major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched and MHC-matched murine BMT models, we found that Sirt-1(-/-) T cells had a reduced ability to induce acute GVHD (aGVHD) via enhanced p53 acetylation. Sirt-1-deficient T cells also promoted induced regulatory T cell (iTreg) differentiation and inhibited interferon-gamma production after allo-BMT. Sirt-1 deletion in iTregs increased Foxp3 stability and restrained iTreg conversion into pathogenic T cells. Furthermore, we found that administration with a Sirt-1 inhibitor, Ex-527, significantly improved recipient survival and clinical scores, with no signs of tumor relapse. These results indicate that Sirt-1 inhibition can attenuate GVHD while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Consistently, Sirt-1-deficient T cells also displayed a remarkably reduced ability to induce chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Mechanistic studies revealed that Sirt-1 deficiency in T cells enhanced splenic B-cell reconstitution and reduced follicular T helper cell development. Sirt-1 deficiency in T cells modulated donor B-cell responses reducing both B-cell activation and plasma cell differentiation. In addition, therapeutic Sirt-1 inhibition could both prevent cGVHD and reduce established cGVHD. In conclusion, Sirt-1 is a promising therapeutic target for the control of aGVHD and cGVHD pathogenesis and possesses high potential for clinical application.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Surgery, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ; and.', 'Department of Surgery, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.']",,20181204,,,"['R01 AI118305/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL137373/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6337874,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"The BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax induces high rates of durable remission in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, despite continuous daily treatment, leukemia recurs in most patients. To investigate the mechanisms of secondary resistance, we analyzed paired pre-venetoclax and progression samples from 15 patients with CLL progression enrolled on venetoclax clinical trials. The novel Gly101Val mutation in BCL2 was identified at progression in 7 patients, but not at study entry. It was first detectable after 19 to 42 months of therapy, and its emergence anticipated clinical disease progression by many months. Gly101Val reduces the affinity of BCL2 for venetoclax by approximately 180-fold in surface plasmon resonance assays, thereby preventing the drug from displacing proapoptotic mediators from BCL2 in cells and conferring acquired resistance in cell lines and primary patient cells. This mutation provides new insights into the pathobiology of venetoclax resistance and provides a potential biomarker of impending clinical relapse. SIGNIFICANCE: Why CLL recurs in patients who achieve remission with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax has been unknown. We provide the first description of an acquired point mutation in BCL2 arising recurrently and exclusively in venetoclax-treated patients. The mutation reduces venetoclax binding and is sufficient to confer resistance.See related commentary by Thangavadivel and Byrd, p. 320.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 305.","['Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Cells that are under oxidative stress may undergo apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis could be a potential mechanism mediating chromosome breakages in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Additionally, caspase-activated DNase (CAD) may be the vital player in mediating the chromosomal breakages during oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Chromosomal breakage occurs during apoptosis and chromosome rearrangement. Chromosomal breakages tend to cluster in certain regions, such as matrix association region/scaffold attachment region (MAR/SAR). We hypothesised that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis may result in chromosome breaks preferentially at the MAR/SAR sites. The AF9 gene at 9p22 was targeted in this study because 9p22 is a deletion site commonly found in NPC. RESULTS: By using MAR/SAR recognition signature (MRS), potential MAR/SAR sites were predicted in the AF9 gene. The predicted MAR/SAR sites precisely match to the experimentally determined MAR/SARs. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to induce apoptosis in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NP69) and NPC cells (HK1). Nested inverse polymerase chain reaction was employed to identify the AF9 gene cleavages. In the SAR region, the gene cleavage frequency of H2O2-treated cells was significantly higher than that of the non-treated cells. A few chromosomal breakages were detected within the AF9 region which was previously found to be involved in the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL)-AF9 translocation in an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patient. As for the non-SAR region, no significant difference in the gene cleavage frequency was found between the untreated control and H2O2-treated cells. Furthermore, H2O2-induced cleavages within the SAR region were reduced by caspase-3 inhibitor, which indirectly inhibits CAD. CONCLUSIONS: These results reaffirm our previous findings that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis could be one of the potential mechanisms underlying chromosome breakages in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. MAR/SAR may play a vital role in defining the location of chromosomal breakages mediated by oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, where CAD is the major nuclease.","['Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia. spsim@unimas.my.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0256-2803'],20181204,,,,,PMC6278157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We initially treated her with sorafenib, but she subsequently developed erythema multiforme, which was suspected to be a drug rush due to sorafenib; therefore, sorafenib was discontinued. At the time of discontinuation, immature blast cells were detected in her peripheral blood. Approximately two weeks later, her skin rash improved substantially, but the proportion of blasts in the peripheral blood increased. We performed a bone marrow examination, and she was diagnosed with FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia. FLT3-ITD expression is found in 20-25% of AML and is a known independent poor prognostic factor. To overcome the poor prognosis associated with FLT3-ITD, molecular drugs targeting FLT3-ITD are attracting much attention. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, also has an effect on FLT3-ITD. Although primary disease flares after tyrosine kinase inhibitor discontinuation have been reported, this is the first report to describe discontinuation of sorafenib treatment as a potential trigger of FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia in papillary thyroid cancer.","['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yodogawa Christian Hospital, Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College Hospital, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yodogawa Christian Hospital, Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2065-1957'],20181204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a simple two-hit model in the late nineties, we are now building clonal stories that involve multiple unexpected cellular functions, leading to full-blown AML. In this review, we will address several seminal concepts that result from these new findings. We will describe the genetic landscape of AML, the association and order of events that define multiple sub-entities, both in terms of pathogenesis and in terms of clinical practice.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: IGF2BP2 has been reported to serve as an oncogene in various solid cancers. However, the role of IGF2BP2 in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) is still unknown. METHODS: Public databases Gene Omnibus was used to evaluate the expression of IGF2BP2 in AML patients and healthy controls. In addition, primary cells from these two populations were prepared by Ficoll density centrifugation. Rt-qPCR and western blot were used to detect IGF2BP2 expression in the primary cells from these two populations. Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association of IGF2BP2 and prognosis. Lentivirus-based shRNAs were used to knock down IGF2BP2 in AML cell lines KG-1a and Kasumi. RESULTS: We searched the public database Gene Omnibus and analyzed IGF2BP2 expression in both AML and healthy populations. The results showed that IGF2BP2 was overexpressed in AML patients. To verify this phenomenon in fresh human samples, we compared the expression of IGF2BP2 in primary cells from 10 AML patients and 10 healthy controls and found that the expression of IGF2BP2 was upregulated in AML primary cells. More importantly, we observed that IGF2BP2 expression was negatively correlated with the CEBPA mutation status, which is an indicator of good prognosis (RR=0.648, p=0.0001). In addition, IGF2BP2 expression was positively associated with poor prognostic factors, such as the FLT3-ITD mutation (RR=1.198, p=0.0009) and IDH1 mutation (RR=1.354, p=0.0003), as well as intermediate and poor cytogenetic risk (RR=1.214, p=0.0026). To evaluate the prognostic value of IGF2BP2 in AML, we further performed a meta-analysis of 8 studies consisting of 1731 patients and found that IGF2BP2 overexpression was correlated with worse overall survival in AML patients [HR=1.31(1.16-1.49); p = 0.00]. Furthermore, we performed Gene Omnibus and Gene Set Enrichment analyses and found that the genes regulated by IGF2BP2 were mainly enriched in cell proliferation. IGF2BP2 knockdown by 4 different shRNA vectors significantly inhibited the growth of two AML cell lines, KG-1a and Kasumi. CONCLUSION: Thus, IGF2BP2 may serve as a biomarker to predict the prognosis of AML and as a potential target in AML.","['Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Central Hospital of MianYang city, Mianyang, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Experimental Animal Research Center, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Chinachenzhigang@zju.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immune Therapy of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, Chinachenzhigang@zju.edu.cn.']",,20181204,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in children and adolescents with ALL from January 2013 to December 2017. The patients underwent ophthalmologic evaluations before starting treatment (D0), on the eighth day (D8), at the 28th day (D28), and at six months (D6 months). Ocular hypertension (OH) was considered in results above 21 mmHg. Measures of visual acuity <20/40 were considered visual loss (VL). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were examined and 18 (32.7%) presented OM, been OH (61.1%), retinal hemorrhage (22.2%) and VL (22.2%) the most frequent finds. A strong association was found between patients with OM and those with a high risk of relapse (p = 0.035, Cramer V = 0.31) and who used the 1999 protocol (p = 0.022, Cramer V = 0.32). The risk of OM in patients from the 1999 protocol was 2.917 (CI = 1.099-7.742), while the risk of relapse it was 0.327 (CI 95% 0.107-0.999). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALL have a high incidence of OM due to the treatment and the disease itself, and it may even be asymptomatic and evolve with VL. Of these, we can highlight OH as the most prevalent. Patients submitted to the 1999 protocol and at high risk of relapse are more likely to present OM and these variables are strongly associated.","['Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Federal University of Sergipe, Rua Itabaiana 758, Bairro Sao Jose, 49.015-110, Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil.

These doses are being used in an epidemiological investigation of leukemia and male breast cancer as part of a study of one million U.S. persons to investigate risk from chronic low-dose radiation exposure. METHODS: Previous doses to these veterans had been estimated for compensation and tended to be biased high but newly available documentation made calculating individual doses and uncertainties using detailed exposure scenarios for each veteran possible. The techniques outlined in this report detail the methodology for developing individual scenarios and accounting for bias and uncertainty in dose based on the assumptions made about exposure. RESULTS: Doses to the atomic veterans in this sub-cohort were relatively low, with about two-thirds receiving red bone marrow doses <5 mGy and only four individuals receiving a red bone marrow dose >50 mGy. The average red bone marrow dose for members of the sub-cohort was 5.9 mGy. Doses to male breast were approximately 20% higher than red bone marrow doses. Discussion and Challenges: Relatively low uncertainty was achieved as a result of our methodology for reconstructing exposures based on knowledge of the individual veterans' locations and activities from military records. Challenges did arise from use of military records to determine probability of participation in specific activities but accounted for in estimates of uncertainty.","['a Risk Assessment Corporation , 417 Till Rd. , Neeses , SC 29107 ;', 'b 33 Greenwich Ave. , New York , NY 10014 ;', 'c Scientific Consulting, Inc ., 1103 East 4th St., Box 760 , Freeman , SD 57029 ;', 'd Cascade Scientific, Inc ., 1678 NW Albany Ave. , Bend , OR 97703 ;', 'e Bridger Scientific, Inc ., 125 Jackpot Lane , Belgrade , MT 59714 ;', 'f 340 Meyers St., P.O.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries, while it is rare in Asia. It is defined by the presence of more than 5 G/L of B cell clonal. If its evolution is very heterogeneous, the treatment required in the active forms of the disease, progressive stages A and B and stage C of the classification of Binet, benefited in recent years of considerable progress. We consider in this paper the treatment of CLL front line and in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R), with or without inactivation of TP53: deletion or del(17p) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene. We will discuss the place of immunochemotherapy, including the choice of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies: rituximab, ofatumumab or obinutuzumab. For BCR inhibitors, we will limit to the most mature drugs that have obtained marketing authorization: inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) ibrutinib and phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) delta, idelalisib. Given its impact, research inactivation of TP53 should be performed before each line of therapy, his presence modifying therapeutic strategies. The treatments, if properly codified, must consider the often little known side effects, whose management is complex.","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, hopital de la Cote de Nacre, CHU de Caen, Caen, France.""]",,,,,,,,"[""L'auteur declare des liens d'interets avec Gilead, Janssen, Roche.""]",,,,,Traiter les formes actives de la maladie.,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the significance of dynamic MRD pretransplantation on outcome of AML patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 145 consecutive AML patients undergoing allo-HSCT in complete remission status between June 2013 and June 2016. MRD was determined with multiparameter flow cytometry after the first and second courses of chemotherapy and pre-HSCT. Results: In matched sibling donor transplantation (MSDT) settings, patients with positive MRD had higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) than those without MRD after the first (32.3 +/- 9.7% vs. 7.7 +/- 3.1%, chi(2) = 3.661, P = 0.055) or second course of chemotherapy (57.1 +/- 3.6% vs. 12.5 +/- 2.7%, chi(2) = 8.759, P = 0.003) or pre-HSCT (50.0 +/- 9.7% vs. 23.0 +/- 3.2%, chi(2) = 5.547, P = 0.019). In haploidentical SCT (haplo-SCT) settings, the MRD status at those timepoints had no significant impact on clinical outcomes. However, patients with persistent positive MRD from chemotherapy to pre-HSCT had higher CIR than those without persistent positive MRD both in MSDT and haplo-SCT settings. Patients with persistent positive MRD underwent MSDT had the highest relapse incidence, followed by those with persistent positive MRD underwent haplo-SCT, those without persistent MRD underwent haplo-SCT, and those without persistent MRD underwent MSDT (66.7 +/- 9.2% vs. 38.5 +/- 6.0% vs. 18.8 +/- 8.7% vs. 12.0 +/- 1.0%, chi(2) = 20.763, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that persistent positive MRD before transplantation was associated with higher CIR (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.200-2.382, P = 0.003), worse leukemia-free survival (HR = 1.812, 95% CI: 1.168-2.812, P = 0.008), and overall survival (HR = 2.354, 95% CI: 1.528-3.627, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that persistent positive MRD before transplantation, rather than positive MRD at single timepoint, could predict poor outcome both in MSDT and haplo-SCT settings.","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.""]",,,,,,,PMC6278188,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"BACKGROUND: This population-based study considered the influence of rituximab on the survival of children (0-19 years), adolescents, and young adults (AYAs, 20-39 years) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS: Data on 642 children and AYAs diagnosed with DLBCL during 2001-2014 were obtained from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry in California. Facility-level reports provided treatment details. The Kaplan-Meier method estimated survival and Cox regression models examined the association between survival and rituximab use, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Rituximab use increased from 2001-2007 to 2008-2014 among children (from 32% to 48%), AYAs (from 68% to 84%), and HIV patients (from 57% to 67%). Five-year survival was higher among children (91%) than AYAs (82%). On multivariable analysis, the hazard of death was 44% lower among rituximab recipients, and higher among uninsured patients, those with HIV, and those with advanced stage at diagnosis. HIV patients who received rituximab were 60% less likely to die than nonrecipients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a benefit of rituximab on the treatment of AYAs and HIV patients with DLBCL. The worse survival observed among HIV-positive and uninsured patients is of concern and calls for further investigation. Careful consideration should be given on whether to recommend rituximab more often on the front-line treatment of children and HIV-positive patients with DLBCL.","['Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', ""Department of Oncology and Global Pediatric Medicine, Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center of Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center of Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1644-0313'],20181204,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jul;66(7):e27768.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"BACKGROUND: A thorough understanding of local and contemporary invasive fungal infection (IFI) epidemiology in immunocompromised children is required to provide a rationale for targeted prevention and treatment strategies. METHODS: Retrospective data over 10 years from four tertiary pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) units across Australia were analyzed to report demographic, clinical, and mycological characteristics of IFI episodes, and crude IFI prevalence in select oncology/HSCT groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to calculate 180-day overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 337 IFI episodes occurred in 320 children, of which 149 (44.2%), 51 (15.1%), and 110 (32.6%) met a modified European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (mEORTC) criteria for proven, probable, and possible IFI, respectively. There were a further 27 (8.0%) that met a ""modified possible IFI"" criteria. Median age at IFI diagnosis was 8.4 years. Crude mEORTC IFI prevalence in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, solid tumor, and allogeneic HSCT cohorts was 10.6%, 28.2%, 4.4%, and 11.7%, respectively. Non-Aspergillus species represented 48/102 (47.1%) molds identified, and non-albicans Candida represented 66/93 (71.0%) yeasts identified. There were 56 deaths among 297 children who met mEORTC criteria, with 180-day overall survival for proven, probable, and possible IFIs of 79.7%, 76.2%, and 84.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Non-Aspergillus molds and non-albicans Candida contributed substantially to pediatric IFI in our study, with high IFI prevalence in leukemia and allogeneic HSCT cohorts. Inclusion of IFIs outside of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria revealed an IFI burden that would go otherwise unrecognized in published reports.","[""Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", 'Biostatistics and Databases Program, Kirby Institute, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', ""Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, Children's Health Queensland, South Brisbane, Australia."", 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Western Australia, Australia.', 'QFAB Bioinformatics, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', ""Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Department of Oncology, Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, Children's Health Queensland, South Brisbane, Australia."", ""Infection Management Service, Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, Children's Health Queensland, South Brisbane, Queensland."", 'The Paediatric Integrated Cancer Service, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', ""Department of Infection and Immunity, Monash Children's Hospital, Clayton, Victoria, Australia."", 'Monash University, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, Children's Health Queensland, South Brisbane, Australia."", 'School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7746-0599'],20181204,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Daunorubicin/cytarabine liposome is approved in several countries worldwide for the treatment of adults with therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (tAML) and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (MRC). Approval was based on its clinical benefit in older patients with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary AML in a pivotal phase III trial. In this study, daunorubicin/cytarabine liposome significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) relative to conventional chemotherapy with cytarabine plus daunorubicin (hereafter referred to as 7 + 3). Daunorubicin/cytarabine liposome was also associated with significantly higher rates of complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi) compared with 7 + 3. Daunorubicin/cytarabine liposome had an acceptable tolerability profile in older patients with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary AML. The safety profile of daunorubicin/cytarabine liposome, including types and severities of adverse events, was generally similar to that of 7 + 3. Therefore, daunorubicin/cytarabine liposome is an important treatment option for adults with newly diagnosed tAML or AML-MRC.","['Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland, 0754, New Zealand. demail@springer.com.']",,,,['Drugs. 2018;78(18):1911.

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"PURPOSE: Idasanutlin is a selective small-molecule MDM2 antagonist. It activates the tumor suppressor TP53 and is in phase 3 clinical trial for acute myeloid leukemia. Nonclinical studies have shown that glucuronidation is the major metabolizing mechanism for idasanutlin and UGT1A3 is the major metabolizing enzyme. There are reported examples of UGT polymorphisms associated with drug metabolism or response. Thus, the aim of this analysis is to investigate if UGT polymorphism is associated with idasanutlin pharmacokinetics. METHOD: Idasanutlin clearance was derived and normalized from two phase I studies. Its clearance level was compared between patients with different genotypes at 44 non-monomorphic UGT SNPs. Several single-locus and multi-locus association analysis, including haplotype association analysis and pairwise SNP interaction (epistasis) analyses were performed to investigate if there is any association between UGT genotypes and idasanutlin clearance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 69 patients who have both idasanutlin pharmacokinetic data and UGT genotyping data were analyzed for association. The major clearance enzyme for idasanutlin, UGT1A3, has no association with idasanutlin clearance.

Keeping efforts to estimate survival is critical to monitoring and improving patients' quality of life with leukemia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 5-year survival rate of leukemia patients in Iran using meta-analysis method. Methods: This meta-analysis was carried out according to studies that adhere to inclusion and exclusion criteria during enrolment. The valid Iranian databases included: Medex, Magiran, SID, and Medlib, along with international data bases, namely, Scopus, Pubmed, and ISI were searched to find relevant articles. After determining the heterogeneity between studies, the random effects models were used to estimate pooled survival in leukemia patients. Results: In total, 18 studies involving 2517 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled 5-year survival rate was 0.56 % (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.58). According to types AML and ALL, the 5-year survival rates in Iran were 35.0 % (95% CI: 32.0-38.0) and 57.0 % (95% CI: 54.0-60.0), respectively. Conclusion: Based on our findings, slightly less than 50% of leukemia deaths happened in the first 5 years after diagnosis, which is lower than the global average.","['Psychosocial Injuries Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Hamedan University of Medical Sciences, Hamedan, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran.']",,,,,,,PMC6230465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) frequently progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the cells leading to malignant transformation have not been directly elucidated. As progression of MDS to AML in humans provides a biological system to determine the cellular origins and mechanisms of neoplastic transformation, we studied highly fractionated stem cell populations in longitudinal samples of patients with MDS who progressed to AML. Targeted deep sequencing combined with single-cell sequencing of sorted cell populations revealed that stem cells at the MDS stage, including immunophenotypically and functionally defined pre-MDS stem cells (pre-MDS-SC), had a significantly higher subclonal complexity compared to blast cells and contained a large number of aging-related variants. Single-cell targeted resequencing of highly fractionated stem cells revealed a pattern of nonlinear, parallel clonal evolution, with distinct subclones within pre-MDS-SC and MDS-SC contributing to generation of MDS blasts or progression to AML, respectively. Furthermore, phenotypically aberrant stem cell clones expanded during transformation and stem cell subclones that were not detectable in MDS blasts became dominant upon AML progression. These results reveal a crucial role of diverse stem cell compartments during MDS progression to AML and have implications for current bulk cell-focused precision oncology approaches, both in MDS and possibly other cancers that evolve from premalignant conditions, that may miss pre-existing rare aberrant stem cells that drive disease progression and leukemic transformation.","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Ruth L. and David S.

The recognition and elimination of leukemic clones by donor T-cells contribute significantly to Allo-HSCT success. FLT3-ITD, a common mutation in AML, is associated with poor prognosis. Recently, midostaurin became the first FDA approved FLT3-inhibitor for pre-transplant patients with FLT3-ITD in combination with standard therapy. In addition to their multikinase activity which may affect T-cell signaling, FLT3-inhibitors induce apoptosis of malignant cells which may also enhance antigen presentation to activate T-cells. Considering the increased clinical use of these inhibitors in patients with AML, and the limited clinical benefit derived from their use as single agents, understanding how FLT3-inhibitors affect T cell population and function is needed to improve their clinical benefit. We examined the effect of four different FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin, sorafenib, tandutinib, and quizartenib) on T cell populations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy donors and from patients with AML. Midostaurin exhibited a significant decrease in CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3+ T cell population and FOXP3 mRNA expression in healthy and AML PBMCs. Similarly, samples collected from patients with AML treated with midostaurin showed a reduction in Tregs markers. Interferon-gamma(IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), and IL-10 levels were also reduced following midostaurin treatment. Considering the FDA approval of midostaurin for use in patients with AML in the pre-transplant setting, our finding will have important clinical implication as it provides the rationale for functional investigation of the use of midostaurin in post-transplant patients.","['School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. alachkar@usc.edu.', 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA. alachkar@usc.edu.']",,20181203,,,['UL1 TR001855/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6277419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, NOTCH1 activation is identified in approximately one-half of CLL cases even in the absence of NOTCH1 mutations. Hence, there appear to be additional factors responsible for the impairment of NOTCH1 degradation. E3-ubiquitin ligase F-box and WD40 repeat domain containing-7 (FBXW7), a negative regulator of NOTCH1, is mutated in 2% to 6% of CLL patients. The functional consequences of these mutations in CLL are unknown. We found heterozygous FBXW7 mutations in 36 of 905 (4%) untreated CLL patients. The majority were missense mutations (78%) that mostly affected the WD40 substrate binding domain; 10% of mutations occurred in the first exon of the alpha-isoform. To identify target proteins of FBXW7 in CLL, we truncated the WD40 domain in CLL cell line HG-3 via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9). Homozygous truncation of FBXW7 resulted in an increase of activated NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) and c-MYC protein levels as well as elevated hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha activity. In silico modeling predicted that novel mutations G423V and W425C in the FBXW7-WD40 domain change the binding of protein substrates. This differential binding was confirmed via coimmunoprecipitation of overexpressed FBXW7 and NOTCH1. In primary CLL cells harboring FBXW7 mutations, activated NICD levels were increased and remained stable upon translation inhibition. FBXW7 mutations coincided with an increase in NOTCH1 target gene expression and explain a proportion of patients characterized by dysregulated NOTCH1 signaling.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"" (B061), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"" (B061), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"" (B061), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"" (B061), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"" (B061), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5473-4398', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0227-7188']",20181203,['Blood. 2019 Feb 21;133(8):774-776.

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. Characterized by high levels of Native American ancestry, Hispanics are disproportionally affected by this cancer with high incidence and inferior survival. However, the genetic basis for this disparity remains poorly understood because of a paucity of genome-wide investigation of ALL in Hispanics. Performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 940 Hispanic children with ALL and 681 ancestry-matched non-ALL controls, we identified a novel susceptibility locus in the ERG gene (rs2836365; P = 3.76 x 10(-8); odds ratio [OR] = 1.56), with independent validation (P = .01; OR = 1.43). Imputation analyses pointed to a single causal variant driving the association signal at this locus overlapping with putative regulatory DNA elements. The effect size of the ERG risk variant rose with increasing Native American genetic ancestry. The ERG risk genotype was underrepresented in ALL with the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (P < .0005) but enriched in the TCF3-PBX1 subtype (P < .05). Interestingly, ALL cases with germline ERG risk alleles were significantly less likely to have somatic ERG deletion (P < .05). Our results provide novel insights into genetic predisposition to ALL and its contribution to racial disparity in this cancer.","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Children's Hospital and."", 'Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Precision Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Division of Internal Medicine, Graduate Medical Education, MountainView Hospital, University of Nevada, Reno, NV.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Precision Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health and Health Professions and College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Pediatrics, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', ""Maine Children's Cancer Program, Scarborough, ME."", 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', ""Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Department of Oncology and.', ""Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA; and."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Oncology and.', ""Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2889-546X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1850', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0770-9659']",20181203,['Blood. 2019 Feb 14;133(7):628-629.

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"Approximately 8% to 19% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutations, which occur at active site arginine residues R140 and R172. IDH2 mutations produce an oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which leads to DNA and histone hypermethylation and impaired hematopoietic differentiation. Enasidenib is an oral inhibitor of mutant-IDH2 proteins. This first-in-human phase 1/2 study evaluated enasidenib doses of 50 to 650 mg/d, administered in continuous 28-day cycles, in patients with mutant-IDH2 hematologic malignancies. Overall, 214 of 345 patients (62%) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML received enasidenib, 100 mg/d. Median age was 68 years. Forty-two patients (19.6%) attained complete remission (CR), 19 patients (10.3%) proceeded to an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and the overall response rate was 38.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.2-45.7). Median overall survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.7-9.6). Response and survival were comparable among patients with IDH2-R140 or IDH2-R172 mutations. Response rates were similar among patients who, at study entry, were in relapse (37.7%) or were refractory to intensive (37.5%) or nonintensive (43.2%) therapies. Sixty-six (43.1%) red blood cell transfusion-dependent and 53 (40.2%) platelet transfusion-dependent patients achieved transfusion independence. The magnitude of 2-HG reduction on study was associated with CR in IDH2-R172 patients. Clearance of mutant-IDH2 clones was also associated with achievement of CR. Among all 345 patients, the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hyperbilirubinemia (10%), thrombocytopenia (7%), and IDH differentiation syndrome (6%). Enasidenib was well tolerated and induced molecular remissions and hematologic responses in patients with AML for whom prior treatments had failed.

Caenepeel and colleagues and Ramsey and colleagues have developed two novel, potent, and selective MCL1 inhibitors that are effective against many hematologic malignancies, and Nangia and colleagues describe how one of these inhibitors can be successfully combined with BCL-xL and MEK inhibition to treat KRAS-mutated lung cancer.See related article by Ramsey et al., p. 1566.See related article by Caenepeel et al., p. 1582.See related article by Nangia et al., p. 1598.","['Departments of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, and Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The utility of cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam as empiric therapy for ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancy is largely unknown. We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort review of 103 adult inpatients with leukemia and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients with monomicrobial ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia. No association between increased 14-day mortality and empiric treatment with cefepime (8%) or piperacillin-tazobactam (0%) relative to that with carbapenems (19%) was observed (P = 0.19 and P = 0.04, respectively). This observation was consistent in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for confounding and an inverse probability of treatment-weighted (IPTW) Cox proportional hazards model. Both fever and persistent bacteremia were more common in patients treated empirically with cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam. Empiric treatment with cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam did not result in increased mortality relative to that with treatment with carbapenems in patients with hematologic malignancy and ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia, although most patients were changed to carbapenems early in treatment. However, due to prolonged fever and persistent bacteremia, their role may be limited in this patient population.","['Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG), UTHealth McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA slaitken@mdanderson.org.', 'Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG), UTHealth McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8659-4238'],20190129,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6355563,,['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"INTRODUCTION: Although a considerable improvement in survival of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been seen over the past decades, real-life outcomes seem to be worse than those reported by prospective studies. We aim to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients diagnosed with APL in an academic hospital from the University of Sao Paulo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 61 patients with APL diagnosed between January 2007 and May 2017. Baseline clinical features and follow-up data were collected, focusing on early toxicity variables such as infection, bleeding, and thrombosis in the first 30 days from diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the 61 patients with APL, 54 received any chemotherapy. All patients also received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Bleeding events were the main cause of death before receiving chemotherapy. Most patients belonged to the intermediate (43%) and high-risk (41%) groups, according to Sanz score. The '7 + 3 + ATRA' regimen was the most used regimen (n = 38). An early death rate of 20% was found, predominantly owing to sepsis. After a median follow-up of 5 years, only 1 relapse was diagnosed. The overall survival at 5 years was 59%. DISCUSSION: In comparison with prospective trials with ATRA-based regimens, we found an inferior overall survival, mostly on account of a high early-death rate. Our results are in line with other real-life retrospective reports published in the past decades. CONCLUSION: Results of real-life studies differ from those found by prospective trials. Accordingly, early actions and supportive care are still needed, aiming to decrease toxicity, especially in developing countries.","['Institute of Cancer of Sao Paulo, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Epub 2018 Apr 18.,"BACKGROUND: Donor-related neoplasms are a potential complication of treatment strategies involving stem cell transplantation. Although mechanisms for detection of short-term complications after these procedures are well developed, complications with delayed onset, notably transmission of chronic diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have been difficult to assess. Consequently, we studied the potential of human CML cells to engraft hematopoietic tissues after intravenous implantation in mice. METHODS: Human peripheral blood cells, collected from CML patients presenting with moderately increased white blood cells count before treatment, were transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated, immunodeficient mice. Five weeks after transplantation the nuclear cells were isolated from the murine bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood and were used to quantitatively detect human CD45 antigen by flow cytometry; qRT-PCR was used to detect the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, and the human or murine beta-glucuronidase housekeeping gene was used to examine human-murine chimerism. RESULTS: We found that all evaluated animals had donor chimerism at the selected interval after transplant and the presence of a specific BCR-ABL1 fusion gene transcript was also detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the risk of neoplasm transmission cannot be eliminated during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from undiagnosed CML donors with borderline leukocytosis. The obtained data confirms the potential of leukemic cells to viably engraft the hematopoietic organs post-transplantation in an immunosuppressed recipient.","['Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.

Epub 2018 Aug 9.,"Cytogenetic analysis has become a standard procedure in the management of newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Prognostic information is reported based on the presence of certain abnormalities and karyotype complexity after conventional karyotyping and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The information on cytogenetic abnormalities occurring in isolation is robust; however, the performance of patients with two or more cytogenetic abnormalities is heterogeneous and information is scarce. This retrospective study analyzed whether information on the precise determination of primary cytogenetic abnormalities can have some added value in terms of risk stratification in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The study cohort was 121 patients without the need to start treatment for CLL immediately after diagnosis but had completed initial cytogenetic analysis. Results from conventional karyotyping after stimulation of CLL cells and FISH analysis were combined. Risk stratification based purely on the determination of primary cytogenetic abnormalities was effective in CLL patients, with comparable results in stratification based on the presence of certain abnormalities and karyotype complexity. It is recommended that information on suspected primary abnormalities is included in cytogenetic reports, especially in patients with two or more abnormalities, because this can provide valuable additional information.","['Institute of Biology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech Republic.']",,20180809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis is overall poor, only stem cell transplantation being consistently reposted as a potentially curative approach. In this study we explored whether microvessel density, a biomarker of angiogenesis, might be relevant in MS. We studied 60 MS, 24 acute myeloid leukemia, 5 normal bone marrow samples and 2 cases of extramedullary hemopoiesis in patients without evidence of hematological malignancy. We used immunohistochemistry (anti-CD34) to identify and quantify micro-vessel density (MVD) and micro-vessel grading (MVG). We found that MS had significantly higher MVD and MVG than normal bone marrow (p = 0.0002 and p < 0.001, respectively). We then found that cases with monocytic morphology had significantly higher MVD than myelo-monocytic and blastic ones (p = 0.005), while no differences were recorded based on extramedullary site. Finally, we found that higher MVD and higher MVG were associated with inferior outcome in terms of overall survival in multivariate analysis (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively), when censoring for stem cell transplantation was undertaken. In conclusion, we documented for the first time that increased angiogenesis is characteristic of MS and correlates with survival, suggesting that anti-angiogenic approaches might deserve a clinical evaluation in this setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 29.,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm, is characterized by thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, fever and excess myelomonocytic cells. Approximately 35% of patients with JMML occur D61Y mutation in PTPN11, and it increases the activity of the protein. However, the effect of the D61Y mutation on SHP2 conformations in molecular basis is poorly understood. Therefore, the molecular dynamics simulations on SHP2-D61Y and SHP2-WT were performed to explore the effect of D61Y mutation on SHP2 and explain the reason for high activity of SHP2-D61Y mutant. The study on the RMSF, per-residue RMSD, PCA, DCCM and secondary structure found that the flexibilities of regions (residues His458-Ser460 and Gln506-Ala509) in SHP2-D61Y were higher than the corresponding regions in SHP2-WT, and the conformations of these regions almost transformed from alpha-helix and beta-strand to Turn, respectively. Thus, the catalytical sites in the PTP domain (residues Asn217-Thr524) were exposed to the substrate easily, which contributed to the enhancement of SHP2-D61Y activity. Moreover, the residue interaction network, H bond occupancy and binding free energy were calculated, revealing that conformational difference were caused by distinctions in residue-residue interactions between Asp/Tyr61-Gln506, Gln506-Gln510, Gln506-Phe251, Gln506-Gly60, Gln506-Tyr63, Asp/Tyr61-Cys459, Cys459-Ile463 and Cys459-Arg465. The study here may offer the valuable information to explore the reason for the increased activity of SHP2 after D61Y-mutation.","['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids play essential roles in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL); however, treatment with these agents can result in severe side-effects. This study, the first of its kind in a Saudi population, investigates associations of ABCB1 gene polymorphisms (pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic) with the development of toxicity and side effects (glucose abnormality, liver toxicity and infection) in a small population of Saudi children with ALL. METHODS: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ABCB1 gene (rs 3213619 T129C, rs 2032582 G2677T and rs1045642 C3435T) were analysed in 70 Saudi children with ALL and 60 control subjects. Participants were treated according to the ALL 2000 study protocol. Toxicities were assessed and associations with genotypes were evaluated according to Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC). RESULTS: Significant associations were observed among carriers and the mutated genotype C3435T (ABCB1), which had an incidence of infection (p = 0.05). Although no correlations were found between liver toxicity and glucose abnormalities for patients carrying ABCB1 SNPs, risk factors for liver toxicity were elevated by a factor of three for patients carrying the SNP G2677T, OR 3.00 (1.034-8.702). The risk factor of glucose abnormality toxicity for the patients carring T129C were increased three times OR 3.06 (0.486-19.198). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of infection incidence, polymorphism C3435T may contribute to potential life-threatening infections during paediatric ALL therapy, through glucocorticoid usage.","['Medical Laboratory Technology Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"FLT3 is often over-expressed in AML, and FLT3 mutants, especially FLT-ITD, are closely related to the poor prognosis in AML patients. Thus, FLT3 has become an attractive target for AML therapy. A series of FLT3 inhibitors have been evaluated in various clinical trials, one of which was approved for AML. However, current FLT3 inhibitors still faced the challenges of kinase selectivity and drug resistance due to concurrent FLT3-ITD-TKD mutations. In this work, a new FLT3 inhibitor (compound 1) with simple structure was discovered through virtually screening an in-house molecule database which contains numerous compounds with kinase-inhibition activity. Compound 1 was identified with potent inhibitory activity against several FLT3 mutants and high FLT3 selectivity over other kinases. Moreover, its anti-growth effects on tumor cells in vitro were dependent on the expression of FLT3-ITD, and it showed little cytotoxicity to MV4-11 and human normal cells. Mechanism studies illustrated that compound 1 blocked FLT3 pathway, caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in MV4-11cells. Finally, the binding mode of compound 1 was studied by molecular dynamics simulations, which provides insights into key residues involved in intermolecular binding and further structural optimization strategy. Compound 1 can thus serve as a good starting point for the research on FLT3 inhibitors towards the kinase selectivity and potential to overcome drug resistance.","['School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou, 450046, PR China.', 'Center of Drug Discovery, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, PR China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, PR China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, PR China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, PR China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, PR China.', 'School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, PR China.

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the deadliest hematological malignancies without effective treatment for most patients. Vitamin D derivatives (VDDs) - active metabolites 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (1,25D2) and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) and their analogs - are differentiation-inducing agents which have potential for the therapy of AML. However, calcemic toxicity of VDDs limits their clinical use at doses effective against cancer cells in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that in AML cell cultures, moderate pro-differentiation effects of low concentrations of VDDs can be synergistically enhanced by structurally distinct compounds known to activate the transcription factor Nuclear Factor (Erythroid-derived 2)-Like 2 (NFE2L2 or Nrf2). Particularly, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), which is clinically approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, strongly cooperated with 1,25D3, PRI-5100 (19-nor-1,25D2; paricalcitol) and PRI-5202 (a double-point modified 19-nor analog of 1,25D2). The pro-differentiation synergy between VDDs (1,25D3 or PRI-5202) and Nrf2 activators (DMF, tert-butylhydroquinone or carnosic acid) was associated with a cooperative upregulation of the protein levels of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Nrf2 as well as increased mRNA expression of their respective target genes. These data support the notion that VDDs and Nrf2 activators synergize in inducing myeloid cell differentiation through the cooperative activation of the VDR and Nrf2/antioxidant response element signaling pathways. We have previously reported that PRI-5202 is more potent by approximately two orders of magnitude than 1,25D3 as a differentiation inducer in AML cell lines. In this study, we found that PRI-5202 was also at least 5-fold less calcemic in healthy mice compared to both its direct precursor PRI-1907 and 1,25D3. In addition, PRI-5202 was remarkably more resistant against degradation by the human 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase than both 1,25D2 and 1,25D3. Importantly, using a xenograft mouse model we demonstrated that co-administration of PRI-5202 and DMF resulted in a marked cooperative inhibition of human AML tumor growth without inducing treatment toxicity. Collectively, our findings provide a rationale for clinical testing of low-toxic VDD/DMF combinations as a novel approach for differentiation therapy of AML.","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Soroka University Medical Center, and Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 84105 Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, Soroka University Medical Center, 84101 Beer Sheva, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University, 939-0398 Imizu, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University, 939-0398 Imizu, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Research Institute, 01-793 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.

We have reported that in an in vitro model of a potential therapeutic regimen for AML, the activity of cytarabine (AraC) is enhanced by a sequential treatment with a combination of the vitamin D2 analog Doxercalciferol (D2) and the plant-derived antioxidant carnosic acid (CA). Importantly, the enhancement occurred selectively in patient-derived AML blasts, but not in the normal bone marrow cells. We now demonstrate that TXNIP, previously known as Vitamin D up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1) [PMID 808674] plays a part in signaling cell death (CD) in this regimen. This is shown by the reduced CD when TXNIP protein levels are decreased by the CRISPR/CAS9 or RNAi technology. Further, we show that direct activation of ASK1 kinase by TXNIP is required for the optimal transmission of the CD signal to apoptotic machinery, regulated by JNK and BIM. These studies provide a rationale for a projected clinical trial of this vitamin D-based new therapeutic regimen for AML.","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers NJ Medical School, Newark, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, United States.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers NJ Medical School, Newark, NJ, United States.

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"BACKGROUND: In a proportion of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), resistance to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (BTKi) is attributed to acquired BTK/phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) mutations. However, knowledge regarding additional genetic lesions associated with BTK/PLCG2 mutations, and gene mutations in patients lacking BTK/PLCG2 mutations, is limited. METHODS: Using targeted deep sequencing, mutations in 29 genes associated with CLL and/or the BCR signaling pathway were assessed in patients with CLL who developed resistance to BTK inhibition with ibrutinib/acalabrutinib at a single institution. RESULTS: The study group included 29 patients with BTKi-resistant CLL, 23 patients with disease progression, and 6 patients with Richter transformation (RT). The median times to disease progression and RT were 33.3 months and 13.3 months, respectively. In 11 patients, sequencing was possible at both baseline (prior to treatment with BTKi) and at time of disease progression/RT. Of these patients, 4 demonstrated BTK mutations at the time of disease progression/RT; patients without BTK mutations frequently acquired mutations associated with disease progression/RT in TP53, SF3B1, and CARD11, whereas additional mutations were rare in patients with BTK-mutated CLL. Sequencing of all 29 patients at the time of disease progression/RT identified BTK mutations at a frequency of 66%, including a novel V537I mutation. Among patients with disease progression, BTK mutations were observed in 16 patients (70%). The median time to disease progression was shorter in patients without BTK mutations compared with those with BTK-mutated CLL. Among patients with RT, SF3B1 mutations were more frequent than BTK mutations (67% vs 50%). Following BTKi discontinuation, we sequential mutation analysis was performed in 2 patients with RT and 3 patients with disease progression in the setting of persistent disease. Both patients with RT demonstrated disappearance of BTK and expansion of TP53 mutations. All 3 patients with disease progression received venetoclax and demonstrated suppression of BTK mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal, targeted, multigene deep sequencing is informative for the clinical monitoring of mutational evolution in patients with CLL who are receiving BTKi.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2735-168X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307']",20181203,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['(c) 2018 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay was validated for clinical use and was applied to blood samples from patients taking mercaptopurine (6MP). METHODS: RBCs were hemolyzed and deproteinized using perchloric acid, followed by heating for the hydrolysis of nucleotides, and the resultant base was measured using LC-MS/MS. Precision, recovery, linearity, matrix effect, and limit of quantification was validated for clinical application. Our results were compared with another institution's established LC-MS/MS assay. We measured the concentrations of 6TG and 6MMP in RBCs of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and the clinical impact of those metabolites was investigated. RESULTS: The imprecision coefficient of variations of 6TG and 6MMP were 5.7%-8.1%, and the bias was within 5%. Lower limits of quantification were set at 54 ng/mL for 6TG and 1036 ng/mL for 6MMP. Correlation coefficients for 6TG and 6MMP were 0.997 and 1.0 in a comparison study. For clinical proof-of-concept, 74 blood samples were collected from 37 pediatric ALL patients receiving maintenance therapy. Concentration of 6TG ranged from 16.1 to 880 pmol/8 x 10 RBCs and that of 6MMP from 55 to 20,937 pmol/8 x 10 RBCs. The 6MP metabolites were not correlated with WBC or absolute neutrophil count. On the other hand, the higher 6MMP level was associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an assay for the quantification of 6TG and 6MMP in RBCs was established and applied to pediatric ALL patients. Interindividual variability in 6MP metabolite concentrations was considerable and associated with elevation of liver enzymes, which may be useful in the clinical monitoring of 6MP maintenance therapy in pediatric ALL patients.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Seoul National University College of Medicine.']",,,,,,,PMC6358190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been the only treatment option for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) refractory to induction chemotherapy, with only 10-20% of patients achieving long-term survival. Certain donor genotypes may confer leukemia-clearing effects after allo-HSCT. We performed whole-exome sequencing of five pairs of the germ lines in AML patients who achieved long-term remission after allo-HSCT and in their donors, and found two significant variants: EGFR c.2982C > T and CDH11 c.945G > A. To validate the protective effects of these leukemia-clearing genotypes (LCGs), AML patients who received allo-HSCT in a complete-remission status were also analyzed. Twenty-two of 96 donors (22.9%) had LCGs in their genomes, and overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received allo-HSCT from donors with germ-line LCGs (hazard ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.24-0.94, p = .033). These findings indicate that donor germ-line LCGs have phenotypically leukemia-clearing effects and are biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes in allogeneic transplantation in AML patients.","['a Department of Internal Medicine , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.', 'b Division of Biomedical Informatics Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI) , Seoul , Korea.', 'c Biomedical Research Institute , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.', 'b Division of Biomedical Informatics Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI) , Seoul , Korea.', 'b Division of Biomedical Informatics Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI) , Seoul , Korea.', 'd Department of Genetic Epidemiology , Sogang University , Seoul , Korea.', 'e Department of Biochemistry , Ewha Medical Research Institute , Seoul , Korea.', 'f Department of Laboratory Medicine , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.', 'c Biomedical Research Institute , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.', 'b Division of Biomedical Informatics Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI) , Seoul , Korea.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.', 'c Biomedical Research Institute , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Korea.']",,20181203,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Jul;60(7):1606-1607.

Epub 2018 Dec 12.,"Nobiletin, a dietary citrus flavonoid, has been reported to possess several biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the antileukemic effects of nobiletin and its underlying mechanisms on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We demonstrated that nobiletin (0-100 muM) significantly reduced cell viability from 100.0 +/- 9.6% to 31.1 +/- 2.8% in human AML THP-1 cell line. Nobiletin arrested cell cycle progression in G1 phase and induced myeloid cell differentiation in human AML cells. Microarray analysis showed that mRNA expression of the c- KIT gene, a critical proto-oncogene associated with leukemia progression, was dramatically reduced in nobiletin-treated AML cells. Furthermore, we verified that AML cells treated with nobiletin (40 and 80 muM) for 48 h markedly suppressed c-KIT mRNA expression (from 1.00 +/- 0.07-fold to 0.62 +/- 0.08- and 0.30 +/- 0.05-fold) and reduced the level of c-KIT protein expression (from 1.00 +/- 0.11-fold to 0.60 +/- 0.15- and 0.34 +/- 0.05-fold) by inhibition of KIT promoter activity. The knockdown of c-KIT expression by shRNA attenuated cancer cell growth and induced cell differentiation. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of c-KIT abolished nobiletin-mediated cell growth inhibition in leukemia cells. These results indicate that nobiletin exerts antileukemic effects through the down-regulation of c-KIT gene expression in AML cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the combination of a conventional AML chemotherapeutic agent, cytarabine, with nobiletin resulted in more reduction of cell viability in AML cells. Our current findings suggest that nobiletin is a novel c-KIT inhibitor and may serve as a chemo-preventive or -therapeutic agent against human AML.","['Center of Medical Genetics , Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital , Hualien 970 , Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics , Tzu Chi University , Hualien 970 , Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics , Tzu Chi University , Hualien 970 , Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology , Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science , Tainan 717 , Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics , Tzu Chi University , Hualien 970 , Taiwan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3327-828X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2551-350X']",20181212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 18.,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro cytotoxicity of gold nanorods (GNRs) on the viability of spermatogonial cells (SSCs) and mouse acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (EL4s). Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, SSCs were isolated from the neonate mice, following enzymatic digestion and differential plating. GNRs were synthesized, then modified by silica and finally conjugated with folic acid to form F-Si-GNRs. Different doses of F-Si-GNRs (25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 140 muM) were used on SSCs and EL4s. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) proliferation assay was performed to examine the GNRs toxicity. Flow cytometry was used to confirm the identity of the EL4s and SSCs. Also, the identity and functionality of SSCs were determined by the expression of specific spermatogonial genes and transplantation into recipient testes. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using an annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) kit. Results: Flow cytometry showed that SSCs and EL4s were positive for Plzf and H-2kb, respectively. The viability percentage of SSCs and EL4s that were treated with 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 140 muM of F-Si-GNRs was 65.33 +/- 3.51%, 60 +/- 3.6%, 51.33 +/- 3.51%, 49 +/- 3%, 30.66 +/- 2.08% and 16.33 +/- 2.51% for SSCs and 57.66 +/- 0.57%, 54.66 +/- 1.5%, 39.66 +/- 1.52%, 12.33 +/- 2.51%, 10 +/- 1% and 5.66 +/- 1.15% for EL4s respectively. The results of the MTT assay indicated that 100 muM is the optimal dose to reach the highest and lowest level of cell death in EL4s and in SSCs, respectively. Conclusion: Cell death increased with increasing concentrations of F-Si-GNRs. Following utilization of F-Si-GNRs, there was a significant difference in the extent of apoptosis between cancer cells and SSCs.","['Department of Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Nanotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Neuroscience Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Nanobiotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Clinical Nanomedicine Laboratory, ENT-Head and Neck Research Center, Hazrat Rasoul Akram Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Oncopathology Research Center and Dep Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'VetCell Therapeutics, Daimler St, Santa Ana CA, USA.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Epub 2018 Dec 2.,"Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved for treatment of various B-cell malignancies. In ibrutinib clinical studies, low-grade haemorrhage was common, whereas major haemorrhage (MH) was infrequent. We analysed the incidence of and risk factors for MH from 15 ibrutinib clinical studies (N = 1768), including 4 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Rates of any-grade bleeding were similar for single-agent ibrutinib and ibrutinib combinations (39% and 40%). Low-grade bleeding was more common in ibrutinib-treated than comparator-treated patients (35% and 15%), and early low-grade bleeding was not associated with MH. The proportion of MH in RCTs was higher with ibrutinib than comparators (4.4% vs. 2.8%), but after adjusting for longer exposure with ibrutinib (median 13 months vs. 6 months), the incidence of MH was similar (3.2 vs. 3.1 per 1000 person-months). MH led to treatment discontinuation in 1% of all ibrutinib-treated patients. Use of anticoagulants and/or antiplatelets (AC/AP) during the study was common (~50% of patients) and had an increased exposure-adjusted relative risk for MH in both the total ibrutinib-treated population (1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.0) and RCT comparator-treated patients (2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-5.6), indicating that ibrutinib may not alter the effect of AC/AP on the risk of MH in B-cell malignancies.","['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California Irvine, Orange, CA, USA.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele Milano and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Hopital Avicenne, Paris, France.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Juravinski Cancer Centre, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth, UK.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'CHU Hopitaux de Bordeaux, Pessac, France.', 'German CLL Study Group, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Wien, Austria.', 'University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2040-4961', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8937-6351', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6393-6154', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6177-7572']",20181202,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6587776,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Jan 21.,"Vincristine is one of the core chemotherapy agents used in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, one of the major toxicities resulting from vincristine exposure is vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN). When VIPN results in significant morbidity, the vincristine dose may need to be reduced, thus potentially decreasing the effectiveness of treatment. To date, there are no robust biomarkers used clinically to determine which patients will be at risk for worse neuropathy. The current study included genomewide association study (GWAS) in two independent cohorts: Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) ALL trials and a multicenter study based at Indiana University in children with ALL. A meta-analysis of the cohorts identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1045644 and rs7963521, as being significantly (P value threshold 0.05/4749 = 1.05E-05) associated with neuropathy. Subsequently these SNPs may be effective biomarkers of VIPN in children with ALL.","['Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Merck, Upper Gwynedd, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', ""Children's Children Research Institute, Washington, District of Columbia, USA."", 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7641-3408', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7653-5920']",20190121,,,"['R01 GM099924/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD062484/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6513686,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (c) 2018 American', 'Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.']",,,['NIHMS1000142'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 1.,"Hydroquinone (HQ), one of the most significant metabolic activation products of benzene in an organism, can cause hematological toxicity, such as acute myeloid leukemia. It is a clear carcinogen that can cause changes in the disorder of cell cycle and cell growth. However, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. E4 transcription factor 1 (E4F1), an important transcription factor, participating in the regulation of cell cycle may be related to the occurrence of tumor. Here, we examined the HQ-induced malignant transformed TK6 cells (TK6-HT) to illustrate the role of E4F1 in carcinogenesis. The present study showed that both the expressions of E4F1 messenger RNA and protein increased obviously in TK6-HT, preliminarily indicating that E4F1 is associated with HQ-induced carcinogenesis. To further explore the role of E4F1, we established E4F1 silencing TK6-HT (pLVX-shE4F1) and its control cells (pLVX-shNC) using lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference expression plasmid vector pLVX-shRNA. Flow cytometry and cell counting kit-8 assay were used to determine the effects of E4F1 silencing on cell cycle and cell growth, respectively. E4F1 silencing inhibited cell growth in TK6-HT. The results from flow cytometry indicated that the inhibitory effect on cell growth may be the results of the E4F1 silencing-induced accumulation in G2/M compared with TK6-HT-shNC. Meanwhile, levels of DNA damage (gamma-H2AX), proteins of Rb and phosphorylated Rb, and reactive oxygen species were increased in TK6-HT-shRNA2 cells, which is the critical reason of cell-cycle arrest. In conclusion, E4F1 silencing inhibits the cell growth through cell-cycle arrest in malignant transformed cells induced by HQ.","['Foshan Institute of Occupational Disease Prevention and Control, Foshan, Guangdong, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Huizhou Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment, Huizhou, China.', 'Huizhou Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment, Huizhou, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, China.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2652-0130'],20181201,,,"['81202231/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'A2018225/Medical Scientific Research Funding of Guangdong Province', '201708440542/China Scholar Council', 'B2017021/Scientific Research Funding of Guangdong Medical University']",,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,"BACKGROUND: Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The alternative WT1 gene (AWT1) is generated from alternative transcription start site in the WT1 first intron and encodes an N-terminal-truncated protein lacking the repressor domain. Although WT1 overexpression is a common feature in AML, the expression levels of the AWT1 and its underlying epigenetic alterations, as well as their clinical relevance in AML remain unknown. METHODS: Quantitative assessment of AWT1 gene transcripts was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bisulfite PCR followed by pyrosequencing was done to determine the methylation status of the AWT1 promoter. The bone marrow samples were collected at diagnosis and after completion of induction chemotherapy from 80 newly diagnosed AML patients. Forty non-malignant BM samples were recruited as controls. RESULTS: The AWT1 was significantly overexpressed in AML patients. Robust hypermethylation of the AWT1 promoter was found to be a highly specific and sensitive marker for AML (p < 0.001). Significant positive correlations between the AWT1 expression and methylation levels with BM blast counts at both initial diagnosis and after induction therapy were observed (p < 0.001). AWT1 overexpression at the initial diagnosis of AML was found to be an independent negative factor for complete remission response after induction therapy (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: The AWT1 gene overexpression-hypermethylation signature is a characteristic marker that positively correlates with the leukemic burden in AML. AWT1 overexpression at AML diagnosis is an independent negative predictor for CR after induction chemotherapy.","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. rehamhalem@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2113-3569'],20181130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, numerous studies suggested that arsenic trioxide acts as anti-cancer roles in various human malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the critical targets of arsenic trioxide and their interaction network systematically by searching the publicly available published database like DrugBank (DB) and STRING. Seven direct protein targets (DPTs) and 111 DPT-associated genes were identified. The enrichment analysis of arsenic trioxide associated genes/proteins revealed 10 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Among these pathways, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-3-kinase -Akt (PI3K-Akt) single pathway and pancreatic cancer pathway are highly correlated with arsenic trioxide and have 5 overlapped targets. Then we investigated the gene alternation of selected critical genes in pancreatic cancer studies using cBio portal. These results indicated that arsenic trioxide could act anti-tumor function through PI3K-Akt single pathway and identified critical genes might be therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.","['Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. liushanrong@hotmail.com.']",,20181130,,,"['81425019/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'GZ2015009/the Research Program of Specially Appointed Professor of Shanghai']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been little development in these methodologies since that time, a period that has witnessed huge technological advances, particularly with the emergence of digital multi-parameter flow cytometric systems. Concurrent advancement in our understanding of redox regulation within eukaryotic cellular systems has also followed, whereby it is now accepted that cysteine thiols partake in redox reactions, which regulate protein activity and function (Groitl and Jakob (2014), Won et al. (2012)). Moreover, we are at the dawn of a new era in redox biology whereby the importance of 'reductive stress' in eukaryotic cellular systems is gathering momentum (Wadley et al. (2018) [4]). It is therefore critical that methods be continually advanced to better understand these concepts in more detail at the cellular level. Flow cytometry is a powerful technique that may be used for this purpose. Henceforth we have rejuvenated these methods to address modern scientific questions. In this paper, essential detail is provided on: *The adaption of a protocol initially described by Durand and Olive [1] for use with modern digital flow cytometer configurations. Here we provide optimal conditions for labelling intracellular thiols with F5M for detection using digital flow cytometers.

Median follow-up from treatment discontinuation was 21.5 months and 5 patients died from CML-unrelated causes.

TKI treatment for < 5 years and MR4.5 duration shorter than 4 years were both associated with higher incidence of molecular recurrence. No patient had disease progression. Response status at last control was: MR4.5 (n = 196), MR4 (n = 15), MMR (n = 14), complete cytogenetic response (n = 10), and other (n = 1).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the clinical relevance of clonal hematopoiesis remains controversial and data on patients with detectable clonal hematopoiesis, consolidated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are limited. We analyzed samples from 113 AML patients in complete remission prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the presence of clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutations. The results were correlated with clinical and biological data. In complete remission we found 75 mutations previously linked to clonal hematopoiesis in 47 patients (41.6%). Twenty patients had >/=2 mutations linked to clonal hematopoiesis. DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 were most frequently mutated. When compared to pre-treatment samples we found variable patterns of mutation persistence depending on the gene mutated. In AML patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation the presence of clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutations in complete remission did not associate with inferior clinical outcome. This study demonstrates that clonal hematopoiesis is a frequent phenomenon in AML patients. Presence of clonal hematopoiesis has no negative prognostic impact in the context of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and might be beneficial if certain genes are affected.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.

Here, we report that higher levels of cytoplasmic leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and LIF receptor are correlated with poorer metastasis/recurrence-free survival. Further, single nucleotide variations and signal peptide mutation of LIF are identified in NPC. Cytoplasmic LIF reprograms the invasive mode from collective to mesenchymal migration via acquisition of EMT and invadopodia-associated characteristics. Higher cytoplasmic LIF enhances cancer vascular dissemination and local invasion mechanistically through modulation of YAP1-FAK/PXN signaling. Immunohistochemical analyses of NPC biopsies reveal a positive correlation of cytoplasmic LIF expression with focal adhesion kinases. Pharmaceutical intervention with AZD0530 markedly reverses LIF-mediated cancer dissemination and local invasion through promotion of cytoplasmic accumulation of YAP1 and suppression of focal adhesion kinases. Given the significant role of LIF/YAP1-focal adhesion signaling in cancer dissemination, targeting of this pathway presents a promising opportunity to block metastasis.","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Engineering, National Central University, 300, Zhongda Rd., Jhongli Dist., 32001, Taoyuan City, Taiwan. jennyliu66@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Engineering, National Central University, 300, Zhongda Rd., Jhongli Dist., 32001, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University, 259, Wenhua 1st Rd., Guishan Dist., 33302, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, 259, Wenhua 1st Rd., Guishan Dist., 33302, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, 35 Keyan Rd., Zhunan, 35053, Miaoli County, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University, 259, Wenhua 1st Rd., Guishan Dist., 33302, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Genomic Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, 35 Keyan Rd., Zhunan, 35053, Miaoli County, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Lin-Kou, 5 Fuxing St., Guishan Dist., 333, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'Pathology Core of the Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University, 5, Fuxing St., Guishan Dist., 333, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and University at Lin-Kou, 5, Fuxing St., Guishan Dist., 333, Taoyuan City, Taiwan. tsangrt123@gmail.com.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1909-437X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2356-1551']",20181130,,,,,PMC6269507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL1. However, the basis of this BCR-ABL1-independent resistance in the absence of such mutation remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study is to identify the mechanism of imatinib resistance in CML. To gain insight into BCR-ABL1-independent imatinib resistance mechanisms, we performed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization. We identified various resistance-related genes, focusing on the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Treatment with an MET inhibitor resensitized K562/IR cells to BCR-ABL TKIs. A treatment combining imatinib and a MET inhibitor in K562/IR cells inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, but did not affect AKT activation. Moreover, the combination of MET inhibitor and imatinib suppressed tumor growth in vivo. These results indicate that the activation of MET/ERK and MET/JNK are potential mechanisms of BCR-ABL TKI resistance. Our findings provide new and important information concerning the mechanisms of imatinib resistance in CML, and reveal new proteins potentially involved in BCR-ABL TKI resistance.","['Division of Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potency of this cytotoxic activity depended on the nature of the substituent bonded to the aromatic ring. All complexes exhibited excellent IC50 values. The test compounds were also screened in vitro for their antifungal effect against Candida glabrata and Candida albicans, showing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values lower than those obtained for fluconazole. A brine shrimp bioassay was performed to examine the toxic properties. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that the organotin(IV) complexes bind at the active site of topoisomerase I in a similar manner to topotecan, sharing affinity for certain amino acid side chains (Ile535, Arg364 and Asp533), as well as for similar DNA regions (DA113, DC112 and DT10).","['Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Circuito Exterior s/n, Ciudad Universitaria.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica-Laboratorio de Sintesis de Farmacos Heterociclicos, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas-Instituto Politecnico Nacional.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia-Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular de Bacterias y Levaduras, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas-Iinstituto Politecnico Nacional.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia-Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular de Bacterias y Levaduras, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas-Iinstituto Politecnico Nacional.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Circuito Exterior s/n, Ciudad Universitaria.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Circuito Exterior s/n, Ciudad Universitaria.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Circuito Exterior s/n, Ciudad Universitaria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: First, from a total of 11,149 autopsied cases, 571 (5.1%) cases of VM were observed in 2013. It was significantly higher than those of 2005 (p < 0.05) and earlier. Notably, incidence of cases with mucormycetes (Muc) in 2013 was higher than that of 1997 and earlier (p < 0.001), especially in leukemia cases. Muc cases also showed higher rate of ""severe infection"" compared with other cases (p < .0001). Emerging diseases were also observed. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome cases showed high incidence of VM as a complication. In addition, we observed cases with the rare mycoses caused by Phialopohra verrucosa and Rhodotorula spp. in our analysis. Moreover, the predominant fungal agent of central nervous system infections changed from Cryptococcus spp. to Aspergillus spp. in 2013. This may be considered a breakthrough infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of VM in 2013 became higher than those of 2005 (p < 0.05) and earlier, with a notable increase of incidence in cases with Muc. The occurrence of breakthrough VM and emerging mycoses deserve attention.","['Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University.', 'Department of Hematology, National Center for Global Health and Medicine.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University.', 'Department of Pathology, Kitasato University School of Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying epigenetic transmission remain unclear. The histone methyltransferase Kmt2b is highly expressed in SSCs and is required for the SSC-to-progenitor transition. At the stem-cell stage, Kmt2b catalyzes H3K4me3 at bivalent H3K27me3-marked promoters as well as at promoters of a new class of genes lacking H3K27me3, which we call monovalent. Monovalent genes are mainly activated in late spermatogenesis, whereas most bivalent genes are mainly not expressed until embryonic development. These data suggest that SSCs are epigenetically primed by Kmt2b in two distinguishable ways for the upregulation of gene expression both during the spermatogenic program and through the male germline into the embryo. Because Kmt2b is also the major H3K4 methyltransferase for bivalent promoters in embryonic stem cells, we also propose that Kmt2b has the capacity to prime stem cells epigenetically.","['Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan tomizawa@yokohama-cu.ac.jp kohbo@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'Bioinformatics Laboratory, Advanced Medical Research Center, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Tatzberg 47-51, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Genome Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Tatzberg 47-51, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Genome Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Tatzberg 47-51, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba 277-8562, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba 277-8562, Japan.', 'Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 4056 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Faculty of Sciences, University of Basel, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Tatzberg 47-51, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Tatzberg 47-51, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan tomizawa@yokohama-cu.ac.jp kohbo@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8291-6623', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2668-8371', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5319-7319']",20181130,,,,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],['(c) 2018.

Once symptoms developed, the infusion was discontinued, with observations demonstrating an 8-cm region of edema, warmth, no erythema, and no drainage. Limited supportive management was performed. Physical examination the following day demonstrated no evidence of necrosis, and erythema resolved completely without additional intervention.

Approximately 90% of patients harbor molecular alteration in 1 of 5 genes (PTPN11, NRAS, KRAS, NF1, CBL), which define genetically and clinically distinct JMML subtypes. Three subtypes, PTPN11- , NRAS-, and KRAS-mutated JMML, are characterized by heterozygous somatic gain-of-function mutations in non syndromic children, while two subtypes, JMML in neurofibromatosis type 1 and in JMML in children with CBL syndrome, are characterized by germ line RAS disease and acquired biallelic inactivation of the respective tumor suppressor genes in hematopoietic cells. In addition to the initiating RAS pathway lesion, secondary genetic alterations within and outside of the RAS pathway are detected in about half the patients. Most recently, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles identified distinct methylation signatures correlating with clinical and genetic features and highly predictive of outcome. JMML is a stem cell disorder, and most JMML patients require allogeneic stem cell transplantation for long-term survival. However, spontaneous disease regression is noted in the majority of children with CBL-mutated JMML and in some NRAS-mutated cases. In the absence of 1 of the 5 canonical RAS pathway alteration, rare mutations in other RAS genes and non-JMML myeloproliferative disorders need to be excluded. Understanding the genetic basis of myeloproliferative disorders in early childhood will greatly improve clinical decision making.","[""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Children's Hospital, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.""]",,,,,,,PMC6245977,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

Pediatric hematologic malignancies have been no exception, with a multitude of next generation sequencing studies conducted on large cohorts of patients in recent years. These efforts have defined the mutational landscape of a number of leukemia subtypes and also identified germ-line genetic variants biologically and clinically relevant to pediatric leukemias. The findings have deepened our understanding of the biology of many childhood leukemias. Additionally, a number of recent discoveries may positively impact the care of pediatric leukemia patients through refinement of risk stratification, identification of targetable genetic lesions, and determination of risk for therapy-related toxicity. Although incredibly promising, many questions remain, including the biologic significance of identified genetic lesions and their clinical implications in the context of contemporary therapy. Importantly, the identification of germ-line mutations and variants with possible implications for members of the patient's family raises challenging ethical questions. Here, we review emerging genomic data germane to pediatric hematologic malignancies.","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital and Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA.""]",,,,,['K08 CA201611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6245969,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

The clinical manifestations and overall outcomes of MDS are very heterogeneous with an overall survival that can be measured in years for some patients to a few months for others. Prognostic scoring systems are important staging tools that aid physicians in their treatment recommendations and decision-making and can help patients understand their disease trajectory and expectations. Several scoring systems have been developed in MDS with the International Prognostic Scoring System and its revised version, the most widely used systems in clinical practice and trial eligibility. These models and others use mainly clinical variables that are obtained from bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood measurements. Adding molecular data to current models may improve its predictive power but the ultimate method to incorporate this information remains a work in progress. Novel methods to develop a personalized prediction model that provides outcomes that are specific for a patient are currently under way and may change how we think about risk stratification in MDS patients in the future.","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",,,,,,,PMC6246025,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The author declares no competing financial', 'interests.']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

Clonal expansion driven by leukemia-associated somatic mutations, such as DNMT3A, ASXL1, or TET2, is best characterized, but oligoclonality can also emerge without recognized leukemia-driver mutations, perhaps as a result of stochastic neutral drift. Murine models provide compelling evidence that a major mechanism of increased cardiovascular mortality in the context of clonal hematopoiesis is accelerated atherogenesis driven by inflammasome-mediated endothelial injury, resulting from proinflammatory interactions between endothelium and macrophages derived from circulating clonal monocytes. Altered inflammation likely influences other biological processes as well. The rate of development of overt neoplasia in patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), as currently defined, is 0.5% to 1% per year. Contributing factors to clonal progression other than acquisition of secondary mutations in hematopoietic cells (ie, stronger leukemia drivers) are incompletely understood. Disordered endogenous immunity in the context of increased proliferative pressure, short telomeres leading to chromosomal instability, an unhealthy marrow microenvironment that favors expansion of clonal stem cells and acquisition of new mutations while failing to support healthy hematopoiesis, and aging-associated changes in hematopoietic stem cells, including altered DNA damage response, an altered transcriptional program, and consequences of epigenetic alterations, are all potential contributors to clonal progression. Clinical management of patients with CHIP includes monitoring for hematological changes and reduction of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors; eventually, it will also likely include anti-inflammatory therapies and targeted approaches to prune emergent dangerous clones.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",,,,,,,PMC6245996,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The author declares no competing financial', 'interests.']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

Consequently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is no longer the only treatment modality with the ability to deliver long-term survival. In contrast to the central position it held in the treatment algorithm 20 years ago, allografting is now largely reserved for patients with either chronic-phase disease resistant to TKI therapy or advanced-phase disease. Over the same period, progress in transplant technology, principally the introduction of reduced intensity conditioning regimens coupled with increased donor availability, has extended transplant options in patients with CML whose outcome can be predicted to be poor if they are treated with TKIs alone. Consequently, transplantation is still a vitally important, potentially curative therapeutic modality in selected patients with either chronic- or advanced-phase CML. The major causes of transplant failure in patients allografted for CML are transplant toxicity and disease relapse. A greater understanding of the distinct contributions made by various factors such as patient fitness, patient-donor HLA disparity, conditioning regimen intensity, and transplant toxicity increasingly permits personalized transplant decision making. At the same time, advances in the design of conditioning regimens coupled with the use of adjunctive posttransplant cellular and pharmacologic therapies provide opportunities for reducing the risk of disease relapse. The role of SCT in the management of CML will grow in the future because of an increase in disease prevalence and because of continued improvements in transplant outcome.","['Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,PMC6246013,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: C.F.C. has received honoraria from Novartis,', 'BMS, and Pfizer and research support and honoraria from Celgene.']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

More recently, treatment-free remission (TFR) has entered mainstream practice and is increasingly being adopted as the main goal of therapy. This therapeutic shift not only influences TKI selection but also, has necessitated the refinement and dissemination of highly sensitive and accurate molecular monitoring techniques. Measurement of BCR-ABL1 messenger RNA expression through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, reported according to the International Scale, has become the primary tool for response assessment in CML. Achieving specific time-dependent molecular milestones, as defined by global therapeutic guidelines, has been established as critical in maximizing optimal outcomes while identifying patients at risk of therapy failure. Depth and duration of a deep molecular response have become the new therapeutic targets in patients considered for TFR. Consequently, molecular monitoring in CML has become even more critical to ongoing response assessment, identifying patients with TKI resistance and poor drug adherence, and enabling TFR to be attempted safely and effectively.","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; and.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; and.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",,,,,,,PMC6246017,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: N.S. has received honoraria from Novartis,', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Janssen.

Thus, ALL remains a challenging disease to treat in the AYA and adult populations. A major contributing factor that influences prognosis in this population is the reduced prevalence of genetic subtypes associated with favorable outcome and a concomitant increase in subtypes associated with poor outcome. Recent advances in genomic profiling across the age spectrum continue to enhance our knowledge of the differences in disease biology between children and adults and are providing important insights into novel therapeutic targets. Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL is one such subtype characterized by alterations that deregulate cytokine receptor or tyrosine kinase signaling and are amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Ruxolitinib, the first-line therapy for symptomatic or intermediate- and high-prognostic risk MF, has improved overall survival for this population. However, approximately one-half of MF patients will discontinue ruxolitinib by the first few years of therapy due to a spectrum of resistance, intolerance, relapse, or progression to blast phase disease. Danazol, erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and spleen-directed therapies can be useful in the ruxolitinib-resistant setting. In the ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant setting, commercial and novel therapies, either alone or in combination with ruxolitinib, have shown clinical utility. For blast-phase MF, the recent advancements in available AML therapies have increased the options with targeted and more tolerable therapies. In this article, we will discuss our paradigm for the management of relapsed/refractory and blast-phase MF in the context of therapeutic advancements in both AML and MF.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mays Cancer Center, UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, San Antonio, TX; and.', 'Mays Cancer Center, UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, San Antonio, TX.']",,,,['Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program. 2019 Dec 6;2019(1):630.

However, for better or worse, in 2018, cytotoxic induction regimens remain the standard of care for most patients. Indeed, the future likely lies in combinations of therapies that act with a spectrum of mechanisms. Using a case-based format, this review will outline current treatment expectations for patients according to karyotypic risk and familiarize readers with the basis for common induction choices. Relapsed/refractory disease may be especially amenable to interventions with novel agents or clinical trials; however, there are still some patients who most benefit from intensive chemotherapy. This review will outline risk systems that help the practitioner identify those with the best chances for response and survival. Finally, clinical tools, including geriatric assessments and comorbidity calculators, may help clinicians recognize patients for whom disease risk and comorbidity tip the balance against classical chemotherapy, a frequent challenge for those who treat this devastating disease.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.']",,,,,,,PMC6246033,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: L.C.M. has served as a consultant on advisory', 'boards for Celgene, Novartis, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and Incyte, has consulted for', 'Celgene, and receives research funding from Jazz Pharmaceuticals.']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, this comes at the cost of toxicities: medical as well as financial. We highlight some of the unique toxicities associated with the novel agents to apprise our readers about what to expect, how to recognize them, and how to manage these toxicities. One of the toxicities seen with inotuzumab, a CD22 antibody drug conjugate, is sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, which can be fatal in >80% of patients if associated with multiorgan failure. Blinatumomab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD19, is associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, both of which require prompt recognition and management primarily with corticosteroids. CRS and neurotoxicity are more common and more severe with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T). The fact that CAR-T cannot be discontinued on demand adds a layer of complexity to the management of related toxicities of this therapy. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor blocker, is used to treat severe CRS from CAR-T, whereas corticosteroids remain the mainstay for neurotoxicity management. Although effective, these drugs carry a high price tag, and we review the available data on cost-effectiveness of these agents, keeping in mind that median follow-up on most of these studies is limited and that long-term data on durability of response remain to be seen.","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",,,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6246022,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: T.J. declares no competing financial interests.', 'M.R.L. has received research funding from Amgen.']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

Early results in adult trials have also shown significant responses, and strategies aimed at mitigating toxicities associated with the therapy have improved tolerability. Therefore, if available, CAR T-cell therapy deserves consideration for salvage of children and adults with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who are multiply relapsed, refractory, or relapsed after a previous allogeneic transplantation. For patients with a first relapse or who have persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) after initial or relapse therapy, treatment with blinatumomab or inotuzumab is reasonable to help patients achieve MRD(-) remission before definitive therapy with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). A number of studies in younger patients using 4-1BB-based CAR T-cell constructs lentivirally transduced into patient T cells and then optimally expanded have resulted in long-term persistence without further therapy. In 1 study using CD28-based CARs in adults, the benefit of HCT after CAR T-cell therapy was not clear, because a group of patients experienced long-term remissions without HCT. These data suggest that CAR T-cell therapy may be able to substitute for transplantation in many patients, avoiding the risks and long-term consequences of HCT. With this is mind, and with emerging data better defining ways of enhancing CAR T-cell persistence and avoiding relapse through antigen escape, CAR T cells will have a growing role in treatment of both pediatric and adult B-ALLs in the coming years.","[""University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles CA.""]",,,,,,,PMC6246000,"['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: M.A.P. has received research funding from', 'Adaptive Biotech; has consulted for Adaptive Biotech, CSL Behring, and Novartis;', 'has received honoraria from Amgen and Novartis; and has been affiliated with the', ""speakers' bureau for Novartis.""]",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

ALL blast cells express several surface antigens, including CD20, CD22, and CD19, which represent valuable targets for immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies targeting these antigens offer novel mechanisms of action. Within the last several years, the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has been added to chemotherapy for newly diagnosed patients <60 years with CD20(+) pre-B ALL and significantly improved the 2-year event-free survival from 52% to 65%. In adults with relapsed or refractory CD22(+) ALL, the antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in a complete response rate of 81% and median overall survival of 7.7 months with reduced toxicity compared with standard chemotherapy. Similarly, the bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody blinatumomab yielded a complete response rate of 44% and a median overall survival of 7.7 months in an extensively treated ALL population. Moreover, approximately 80% of ALL patients in complete remission with evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) achieved a complete MRD response following treatment with blinatumomab.

We found that the serine/threonine kinase IKBKE, a noncanonical IkB kinase, is expressed at higher levels in myeloid leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells. Inhibiting IKBKE, or its close homolog TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), by either short hairpin RNA knockdown or pharmacological compounds, induces apoptosis and reduces the viability of AML cells. Using gene expression profiling and gene set enrichment analysis, we found that IKBKE/TBK1-sensitive AML cells typically possess an MYC oncogenic signature. Consistent with this finding, the MYC oncoprotein was significantly downregulated upon IKBKE/TBK1 inhibition. Using proteomic analysis, we found that the oncogenic gene regulator YB-1 was activated by IKBKE/TBK1 through phosphorylation, and that YB-1 binds to the MYC promoter to enhance MYC gene transcription. Momelotinib (CYT387), a pharmacological inhibitor of IKBKE/TBK1, inhibits MYC expression, reduces viability and clonogenicity of primary AML cells, and demonstrates efficacy in a murine model of AML. Together, these data identify IKBKE/TBK1 as a promising therapeutic target in AML.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Core and Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, and.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Core and Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",,,,,"['R01 CA160979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL131835/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL116324/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6290107,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used domain-focused CRISPR screening to identify ZFP64 as an essential transcription factor in MLL-rearranged leukemia. We show that the critical function of ZFP64 in leukemia is to maintain MLL expression via binding to the MLL promoter, which is the most enriched location of ZFP64 occupancy in the human genome. The specificity of ZFP64 for MLL is accounted for by an exceptional density of ZFP64 motifs embedded within the MLL promoter. These findings demonstrate how a sequence anomaly of an oncogene promoter can impose a transcriptional addiction in cancer.","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', ""Divisions of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', ""Divisions of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

By integrating measures of chromatin accessibility and enrichment for H3K27 acetylation, we have generated regulatory landscapes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples and representative cell lines. With super enhancer-based modeling of regulatory circuits and assessments of transcription factor dependencies, we discover that the essential super enhancer factor PAX5 dominates CLL regulatory nodes and is essential for CLL cell survival. Targeting enhancer signaling via BET bromodomain inhibition disrupts super enhancer-dependent gene expression with selective effects on CLL core regulatory circuitry, conferring potent anti-tumor activity.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, 149 13th St. Charlestown, Boston, MA 02129, USA; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"To analyze the pattern of multiple mutations detected by Sanger sequencing (SS), we performed subcloning sequencing using 218 samples from 45 patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant chronic myeloid leukemia. At the first time of multiple mutation detection by SS (baseline), a total of 19 major mutations from 45 samples were detected; these mutations were found in the following order: T315I (68.9%), E255 K (33.3%), Y253H (13.3%), G250E (13.3%), and F317 L (11.1%). Subcloning sequencing of 900 baseline colonies identified 556 different mutant types, and 791 among the 900 were colonies with major mutations (87.9%). The mutations were found in the following order: T315I (36.4%), E255 K (16.2%), Y253H (7.0%), G250E (6.7%), M351 T (6.6%), and E255 V (5.3%). In subcloning sequencing with 4357 colonies of 218 serial samples, 2506 colonies (57.5%) had compound mutations, among which 2238 colonies (89.3%) had at least one major mutation. The median number of mutations in compound mutant colonies was 2 (range, 2-7), and most were double (52.9%) or triple (28.7%) mutations. Additionally, some mutations in allosteric binding sites were detected as low level mutation in 13 patients. With the available retrospective samples before baseline, subcloning sequencing identified low-level mutations of various frequencies (median, 10%) to be major mutations in 20 patients. Thus, compound mutations involving T315I and P-loop mutations were the major components of multiple mutations, and some low-level mutations with potential clinical significance were detected by subcloning sequencing. Hence, more sensitive sequencing assays are needed in patients with multiple mutations.","['Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Catholic Hematology Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"The inv(3)(q21q26.2) altering a single chromosome 3 homolog is an established myeloid malignancy-associated entity. Comparatively, double inv(3) cases involving both homologs are exceedingly rare with 13 reports across AML, CML and MDS. This scarcity was confirmed by finding only 2 new cases out of 34,898 bone marrows collected during a 55 year period at a large medical center (0.0005%). The double inv(3) was detected by karyotype and confirmed by FISH on both homologs in a 41 year old female and a 72 year old male with AML. In the latter case, a 2.26-fold increase in MECOM RNA level was found using an NGS myeloid gene panel. Chromosomal microarray analysis identified segmental copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) at 3q21 extending to near the q-arm terminus. This is the third report of distal 3q CN-LOH, substantiating that the double inv(3) arises through somatic repair of acquired segmental LOH. Long term clinical and genetic evaluation revealed no discernible morphologic difference between single and double inv(3) cases, conventional chemotherapy resistance and rapid dominance of the double inv(3) clone. The two new cases are consistent with relatively longer survival of double inv(3) patients in the absence of concurrent chromosome 7 loss compared to those with both abnormalities. Importantly, the first known outcome data of bone marrow transplantation in double inv(3) AML is also presented.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, UH Cleveland Medical Center, 10524 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA; Department of Pathology, UH Cleveland Medical Center, 10524 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"TRIM5 is a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase with potent antiretroviral function. TRIM5 assembles into a hexagonal lattice on retroviral capsids, causing envelopment of the infectious core. Concomitantly, TRIM5 initiates innate immune signaling and orchestrates disassembly of the viral particle, yet how these antiviral responses are regulated by capsid recognition is unclear. We show that hexagonal assembly triggers N-terminal polyubiquitination of TRIM5 that collectively drives antiviral responses. In uninfected cells, N-terminal monoubiquitination triggers non-productive TRIM5 turnover. Upon TRIM5 assembly on virus, a trivalent RING arrangement allows elongation of N-terminally anchored K63-linked ubiquitin chains (N-K63-Ub). N-K63-Ub drives TRIM5 innate immune stimulation and proteasomal degradation. Inducing ubiquitination before TRIM5 assembly triggers premature degradation and ablates antiviral restriction. Conversely, driving N-K63 ubiquitination after TRIM5 assembly enhances innate immune signaling. Thus, the hexagonal geometry of TRIM5's antiviral lattice converts a capsid-binding protein into a multifunctional antiviral platform.","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.', 'Infection and Immunity, University College London, Cruciform Building, 90 Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,"Uterine endometrial carcinoma is one of the common cancers in females. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/cancer-initiating cells (CICs) are a small subpopulation of cancer cells that are tumorigenic and are resistant to treatments, thus they are focused as treatment targets. However, the heterogeneity of CSCs/CICs is still elusive, and we therefore analyzed CSCs/CICs at the clonal level. We previously established sphere-cultured CSCs/CICs from primary human uterine endometrial carcinoma, and we isolated several clones from CSCs/CICs in this study. Interestingly, we established two types of clones based on the growth pattern. The clones were termed sphere clones (S clones) and leukemia-like clones (LL clones). Functional analysis revealed that S clones are resistant to chemotherapy, whereas LL clones are sensitive to chemotherapy. On the other hand, S clones are less tumorigenic, while LL clones are highly tumorigenic. Transcriptome analysis using serial analysis of gene expression sequencing (SAGE-Seq) revealed distinctive gene expression profiles in S clone cells and LL clone cells. The results indicate that CSCs/CICs are composed of functionally heterogenic subpopulations including highly tumorigenic clones and treatment-resistant clones and that the characteristics of CSCs/CICs might be determined by the characteristics of different clones that compose CSCs/CICs.","['Departments of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1 West-17, Chuo-Ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan; Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1 West-17, Chuo-Ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Departments of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1 West-17, Chuo-Ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan; CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo 102-0076, Japan.

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"Cytogenetic and genetic changes have prognostic significance in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In our study, we compared the cytogenetic changes and gene mutations (NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and C-KIT) with clinical outcomes in 1132 patients with AML enrolled at our center over a 10-year period. A total of 977 patients provided gene mutation data. There were subsets of patients who exhibited mutations in NPM1 (17.9%), CEBPA (16.4%), FLT3-ITD (18.5%), FLT3-TKD (3.9%), DNMT3A (8.6%), and C-KIT (8.8%). A total of 557 patients (49.2%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as consolidation therapy. Multivariate analysis identified an adverse karyotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; P=.001), the presence of FLT3-ITD (HR, 1.90; P < .001), and receipt of nonstandard first-line induction chemotherapy (HR, 1.45; P=.003) as significant risk factors for poor overall survival (OS), and the presence of CEBPA(mut) (HR, .42; P < .001) and receipt of HSCT (HR, .35; P < .001) as prognostic factors for favorable OS. In addition, the presence of FLT3-ITD(mut) (HR, 2.11; P < .001) was identified as an independent risk factor for poor disease-free survival (DFS), and receipt of HSCT was correlated with improved DFS (HR, .74; P=.046). Compared with chemotherapy as consolidation therapy, HSCT improved the prognosis and overcame the prognostic effect of karyotype from the initial diagnosis; however, the presence of FLT3-ITD or CEBPA mutation can predict prognosis in AML irrespective of HSCT.","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"A higher number of donor plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) is associated with increased survival and reduced graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in human recipients of unrelated donor bone marrow (BM) grafts, but not granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood grafts. We show that in murine models, donor BM pDCs are associated with increased survival and decreased GVHD compared with G-CSF-mobilized pDCs. To increase the content of pDCs in BM grafts, we studied the effect of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) treatment of murine BM donors on transplantation outcomes. Flt3L treatment (300 mug/kg/day) resulted in a schedule-dependent increase in the content of pDCs in the BM. Mice treated on days -4 and -1 had a >5-fold increase in pDC content without significant changes in numbers of HSCs, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells in the BM graft. In an MHC-mismatched murine transplant model, recipients of Flt3L-treated T cell-depleted (TCD) BM (TCD F-BM) and cytokine-untreated T cells had increased survival and decreased GVHD scores with fewer Th1 and Th17 polarized T cells post-transplantation compared with recipients of equivalent numbers of untreated donor TCD BM and T cells. Gene array analyses of pDCs from Flt3L-treated human and murine donors showed up-regulation of adaptive immune pathways and immunoregulatory checkpoints compared with pDCs from untreated BM donors. Transplantation of TCD F-BM plus T cells resulted in no loss of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect compared with grafts from untreated donors in 2 murine GVL models. Thus, Flt3L treatment of BM donors is a novel method for increasing the pDC content in allografts, improving survival, and decreasing GVHD without diminishing the GVL effect.","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Celldex Therapeutics, Hampton, New Jersey.', 'Celldex Therapeutics, Hampton, New Jersey.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"The production of blood cells and their precursors from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro has the potential to make a significant impact upon healthcare provision. We demonstrate that the forward programming of hPSCs through overexpression of GATA1, FLI1, and TAL1 leads to the production of a population of progenitors that can differentiate into megakaryocyte or erythroblasts. Using ""rainbow"" lentiviral vectors to quantify individual transgene expression in single cells, we demonstrate that the cell fate decision toward an erythroblast or megakaryocyte is dictated by the level of FLI1 expression and is independent of culture conditions. Early FLI1 expression is critical to confer proliferative potential to programmed cells while its subsequent silencing or maintenance dictates an erythroid or megakaryocytic fate, respectively. These committed progenitors subsequently expand and mature into megakaryocytes or erythroblasts in response to thrombopoietin or erythropoietin. Our results reveal molecular mechanisms underlying hPSC forward programming and novel opportunities for application to transfusion medicine.","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Blood Centre, Long Road, Cambridge CB2 0PT, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Qualitative design using semi-structured interviews with 13 parents of children diagnosed with leukemia and 15 professionals in the field of pediatric oncology. Themes were derived with content analysis via deductive and inductive coding. RESULTS: Analysis resulted in five topics. (1) Ability to play in the context of leukemia (2) ways of coping with leukemia (3) difficulty in transition to normality (4) parental quality of life and parents' needs (5) perceptions of the potential of pretend play. CONCLUSION: Study results indicate the potential of pretend play interventions for young cancer patients and the need for additional professional support of parents. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Pretend play is a tool children carry with them regardless of their circumstances. If we can enhance their ability to play, doing so should give them an advantage in creative problem solving and creative expression as they deal with a life threatening disease.","['University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, Department of Medical Psychology, Hamburg, Germany.

Epub 2018 Nov 3.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is one of the most important virus in dairy cattle. The infection behavior follows what we call the iceberg phenomenon: 60% of infected animals do not show clinical signs; 30% develop persistent lymphocytosis (PL); and the remaining 10%, die due to lymphosarcoma. BLV transmission depends on infected cell exchange and thus, proviral load is determinant. Understanding the mechanisms by which cattle governs the control of viral dissemination will be desirable for designing effective therapeutic or preventive strategies for BLV. The development of high proviral load (HPL) or low proviral load (LPL) might be associated to genetic factors and humoral immune responses, however cellular responses are not fully described. It is known that BLV affects cellular homeostasis: proliferation and apoptosis. It is also known that the BLV tropism is directed towards B lymphocytes, and that lymphocytotic animals have elevated amounts of these cells. Usually, when an animal is infected by BLV, the B markers that increase are CD21, CD5 and CD11b. This increase could be related to the modulation of apoptosis in these cells. This is the first work in which animals infected with BLV are classified according to their proviral load and the subpopulations of B and T lymphocytes are evaluated in terms of their percentage in peripheral blood and its stage of apoptosis and viability. PBMCs from HPL animals proliferated more than LPL and non-infected animals. CD11b(+)/CD5(+) lymphocytes in LPL animals presented greater early and late apoptosis than HPL animals and cells of HPL animals had increased viability than LPL animals. Our results confirm that BLV alters the mechanism of apoptosis and proliferation of infected cells.","['Laboratorio de Virologia, Centro de Investigacion Veterinaria de Tandil (CIVETAN, CONICET-UNCPBA-CICPBA), Facultad de Cs.

Epub 2018 May 28.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and associated diseases, like chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML), are heterogeneous, clonal disorders affecting the hematopoietic stem cells. They are characterized by dysplasia and a propensity to evolve toward acute myeloid leukemia. Systemic inflammatory and autoimmune manifestations (SIAMs) occur with a prevalence of 10% to 20% in myeloid malignancies, but the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, we aimed to characterize patient- and disease-based differences in MDS and CMML patients with and without SIAMs and explore the impact of SIAMs on progression and survival. We performed a retrospective, single-centre, and case-control study in a cohort of 93 patients diagnosed with MDS and CMML between 01/2008 and 12/2015. Thirty patients (32%) were identified with SIAMs: musculoskeletal and connective tissue (26.8%), vascular (19.5%), systemic autoinflammation (17%), skin (12.2%), gastrointestinal (9.8%), and others (14.6%). SIAMs were treated with glucocorticoids (60%), methotrexate (16.7%), biologicals (13.3%), and cyclosporine (3.3%). No significant differences between the SIAM and non-SIAM patients were observed in age, gender, or previous exposure to cancer treatment. Cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly more frequent in patients with SIAMs (63.1% vs 90%; OR 5.5; P < .01), but no differences were observed for other comorbidities or IPSS and IPSS-R risk scores. CMML and refractory anemia with excess blasts 1/2 subtypes were by tendency more frequent in patients with and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) in those without SIAMs. Finally, time to progression, leukemia free survival and overall survival were similar for both groups. Despite patient heterogeneity and small cohort size, we were able to identify a significant association of SIAMs with cardiovascular comorbidities but without influence on progression or survival.","['Department of Haematology and Central Haematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Immunology & Allergology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Haematology and Central Haematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department for BioMedical Research, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Haematology and Central Haematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department for BioMedical Research, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Haematology and Central Haematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department for BioMedical Research, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Haematology and Central Haematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department for BioMedical Research, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.

Epub 2018 May 29.,"Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a recently identified high-risk subtype of B-lineage ALL (B-ALL), characterized by a gene expression profile similar to that of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL, but without the hallmark BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Ph-like ALL represents approximately 15% of childhood ALL and its frequency rises with age, peaking among adolescents, and young adults with B-ALL. This subtype is associated with adverse clinical features, persistence of minimal residual disease, and a poor prognosis despite modern chemotherapy regimens. While Ph-like ALL lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion, it is characterized by a diverse spectrum of kinase fusions and cytokine receptor gene rearrangements that may be similarly amenable to molecularly targeted therapies. While survival rates for childhood ALL have drastically improved with intensive conventional chemotherapy, Ph-like ALL represents a novel paradigm of precision medicine in ALL. This review aims to provide a comprehensive review of the clinical picture and genetic basis of Ph-like ALL and to illustrate how these findings can translate into tailored targeted therapies with the hopes of improving the outcomes of Ph-like ALL patients.","['Division of Hematology, Leukemia Program, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Epub 2018 Feb 21.,"Incidence and effect on outcome of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not clearly defined. To address this issue, 103 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed AML, regardless of neurologic symptoms, were submitted to a routine explorative lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from 65 males and 38 females. All 103 CSF samples were examined by conventional cytology (CC) whereas 95 (92%) also by flow cytometry (FCM). At diagnosis, 70 patients (68%) were CNS negative (CNS-), whereas 33 (32%) were CNS positive (CNS+). In 11 of 33 (33%), CNS infiltration was documented either by CC or FCM , in 21 (67%) only by FCM. CNS positivity was significantly associated with a M4-M5 phenotype of the underlying AML (P = .0003) and with high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (P = .006). Overall, 80 of 103 (78%) achieved complete remission with no significant differences between CNS+ and CNS- patients. Five-year disease-free survival and overall survival were found to be shorter in CNS+ patients than in those CNS- (18% vs 50%, P = .006 and 19% vs 46%, P = .02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, CNS status and age were found to affect independently overall survival. In conclusion, the incidence of CNS involvement in adult patients with newly diagnosed AML is higher than expected. Regardless of neurologic symptoms, it should always be searched at diagnosis; CSF samples should routinely be investigated by FCM since a certain proportion of CNS involvements might remain undetected if examination is exclusively CC based.","['Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.

Little is known about the effect of bone marrow fibrosis on response to AZA therapy. We, retrospectively, evaluated clinical predictors of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) for patients treated with AZA in a real-life cohort. We evaluated 94 consecutive patients treated with AZA outside of clinical trials (75mg/m(2)/day for 7 days every 28 days; 5 + 2 + 2 schedule), from June 2009 to February 2016. Ninety-three patients were evaluated for response. After a median of 6 cycles, ORR-complete response (CR; including marrow CR) + partial response (PR) + hematological improvement (HI)-was 41.9% (CR = 18.3%; PR = 11.8%; HI = 11.8%). Stable disease was observed in 21.5%, and failure in 36.5%. Pre-AZA bone marrow blast percentage, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) or IPSS-R category, and time from diagnosis to AZA had no effect on response. Median OS from start of therapy was 18.5 months, and was significantly related to higher IPSS category (P = .01), poor cytogenetics according to the IPSS (P = .01), poor and very poor cytogenetics according to the IPSS-R (P = .02), and lower ORR (P = .006). Patients with MF-0 pre-AZA demonstrated significantly higher ORR, (CR + PR + HI) and stable disease, and lower failure rates than those with any grade of fibrosis. Indeed, cases with pre-AZA fibrosis > MF-1 had shorter OS (P = .005). Achievement of HI before 4 cycles of treatment negatively impacted OS (P = .009).","[""Hematology department, Hematology Unit, IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan, Milan, Italy.

We evaluated retrospectively the histological patterns of 125 necropsy cases of feline lymphoma collected over a 12-year period. Of the 125 cases, 16 showed lung infiltration (12.8%). Nine cats were female, seven cats were male and all were of mixed breed. Gross lesions observed in the lungs consisted of masses (25%) and nodules (18.7%); however, the majority of cases (56.2%) did not show any gross abnormality. Peribronchial-vascular infiltration (93.7%) was the most frequent pattern, followed by pleural (56.2%), interstitial (50%), nodular (37.5%) and alveolar (12.5%) patterns, but 75% of the cases had more than one pulmonary infiltration pattern. There were 14 (87.5%) B-cell and two (12.5%) T-cell lymphomas. Six cats (37.5%) were positive for feline leukaemia virus and three cats (18.7%) were positive for feline immunodeficiency virus. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most frequent type, accounting for 56% of all cases.","['Setor de Patologia Veterinaria, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from herb plants, such as Cortex phellodendri (Huangbai) and Rhizoma coptidis (Huanglian). Huanglian and Huangbai have been used as ""heat-removing"" agents. In addition, berberine has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effect both in vivo and in vitro, where mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions are critically implicated. We herein tested the hypothesis that berberine exerts an anti-inflammatory effect through MAPK and COX-2 signaling pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In Jurkat cells, we found that PHA exposure caused elevation on interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in a time-dependent manner. PHA-stimulated reactions were steeply suppressed by berberine, such as IL-2 mRNA expression and protein secretion. However, berberine did not exert any cytotoxic effect at doses of 40mug/ml. In addition, the possible molecular mechanism of anti-inflammation effect of berberine could be the inhibition of PHA-evoked phosphorylation of p38, since c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) expressions did not alter. Consistent with above results, berberine inhibition on PHA-induced IL-2 secretion could be reversed by treatment of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38-MAPK. Interestingly, upregulation of PHA-induced COX-2 expression was also observed following berberine treatment of Jurkat cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed berberine-induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase after PHA stimulation and decreased percentage of G2/M phase. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of berberine largely potentially results from its ability to attenuate p38 MAPK expression, and does not exclude a positive action of berberine on cell cycle arrest. These results provide an innovative medicine strategy to against or treat T-ALL patients.","['Aesthetic Medical Center, Department of Dermatology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China; Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Urology, Division of Geriatric Urology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China; Bioinformation Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Nursing, National Quemoy University, Kinmen County, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Aesthetic Medical Center, Department of Dermatology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China; Department of Nursing, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China; Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Medical Center of Aging Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China; Department of Biotechnology, College of Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.

Since then, 6 other human oncoviruses have been identified: human papillomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1, and human herpesvirus-8. These viruses are causally linked to 12% of all cancers, many of which have mucocutaneous manifestations. In addition, oncoviruses are associated with multiple benign mucocutaneous diseases. Research regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of oncoviruses and virus-specific treatment and prevention is rapidly evolving. Preventative vaccines for human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus are already available. This review discusses the mucocutaneous manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of oncovirus-related diseases.

MTX is associated with acute and chronic neurotoxicity during treatment, however the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study we investigate whether MTX is neurovirulent to astrocytes in the Central Nervous System (CNS) of adolescent mice. We demonstrated that MTX induced severe cytotoxicity in C6 astrocyte-like cell line and rat primary cultures of astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, GFAP-labeled astrocyte cells significantly decreased in the mouse spinal cord and brain. Furthermore, protein levels of PARP and pro-Caspase-3 were reduced by MTX, indicating MTX-induced apoptosis leads to the astrocytes loss. Notably, overexpression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or exogenous addition of folate markedly reversed the astrocytes toxicity induced by MTX through activating folate metabolism pathway. Taken together, our study provides evidence for neurotoxic effect of MTX-induced astrocytes apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo with disruption of folate metabolism, and additional supplement of folate may provide novel approaches for alleviating the astrocytes toxicity induced by MTX in the clinic.","[""Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China; Department of Pharmacy, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310053, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310053, China.

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"Leukemia is the most frequent malignancy in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as the second commonest type. Long non-coding RNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) has been widely reported as an oncogenic factor in multiple malignancies including AML. However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of ZFAS1 in the tumorigenesis of AML are poor defined till now. In the present study, RT-qPCR assay showed that ZFAS1 was highly expressed in bone marrow of acute leukemia patients and AML cell lines. Loss-of-function analyses revealed that ZFAS1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in AML cells and curbed AML xenograft growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay unveiled that microRNA-150 (miR-150) could interact with ZFAS1, Myb 3' UTR and Sp1 3' UTR. Moreover, ZFAS1 acted as a molecular sponge of miR-150, giving rise to the downregulation of miR-150 level and upregulation of Myb and Sp1 levels. Moreover, miR-150 overexpression resulted in the reduction of AML cell proliferative ability and the increase of cell apoptotic rate. Additionally, the inhibition of miR-150 abrogated ZFAS1 loss-mediated anti-leukemia effects. In summary, our data demonstrated that ZFAS1 knockdown hampered AML progression by regulating miR-150/Myb and miR-150/Sp1 pathways, providing some potential biomarkers or targets for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No.1, East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou City, 450052, Henan, China.

Other contemporary studies showed an advantage from continuous protracted exposure to imatinib, challenging the indications to transplant. The EsPhALL2010 study was designed to assess whether imatinib given from day 15 of induction and continuously throughout chemotherapy led to a different outcome to that obtained in EsPhALL2004, despite decreasing the number of patients having HSCT. METHODS: This prospective, intergroup, open-label, single-arm clinical trial (EsPhALL2010) was done at 11 study groups across Europe, Chile, and Hong Kong. Patients aged 1-17 years with the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) who were recruited into national front-line trials for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were eligible for this trial. Patients with abnormal renal or hepatic function or an active systemic infection were ineligible. Patients received imatinib 300 mg/m(2) continuously from day 15 of induction during chemotherapy. Eligibility to HSCT depended on early morphological response and minimal residual disease. Imatinib was recommended throughout the first year after transplant. The co-primary endpoints were event-free survival and overall survival. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 2004-001647-30) and with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00287105) and is completed. FINDINGS: 158 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 155 were enrolled between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2014. 151 (97%) patients achieved first complete remission after induction and four after the consolidation phase, with 102 (66%) patients categorised as good risk and 53 (34%) as poor risk according to EsPhALL risk stratification criteria. 59 (38%) patients had HSCT during their first complete remission. 40 (26%) patients relapsed and 41 (26%) patients died during the study (25 [61%] during complete continuous remission, and 16 [39%] after relapse). The 5-year event-free survival was 57.0% (95% CI 48.5-64.6) and 5-year overall survival was 71.8% (63.5-78.5). 154 serious adverse events were reported in 80 (52%) of 155 patients. The most common toxicity was infection (61 [39%] patients, mostly bacterial); gastrointestinal disorders occurred in ten (6%) patients and osteonecrosis in eight (5%). Serious adverse events occurred mainly during high-risk blocks and delayed intensifications, including 14 fatal events (one in the consolidation phase, six in high-risk blocks, six in first delayed intensification, and one in second delayed intensification). INTERPRETATION: Although HSCT was done in a smaller proportion of patients in EsPhALL2010 than in EsPhALL2004, event-free and overall survival were similar between the two studies. Our data suggest that imatinib given early and continuously with intensive chemotherapy might increase toxicity.

Our aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of this regimen in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in this ongoing phase 2 trial. METHODS: In our single-centre, phase 2, single-arm trial in the USA, adult patients with previously untreated Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were sequentially enrolled. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, a left ventricular ejection fraction above 50%, and adequate hepatic and renal function (serum bilirubin </=3.0 mg/dL and serum creatinine </=3.0 mg/dL, unless higher levels were believed to be due to leukaemia at the discretion of the investigator). Patients received eight cycles of 21 days, alternating between two drug combinations: hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) and high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine. Ponatinib was given orally at 45 mg per day for the first 14 days of cycle 1 then continuously at 45 mg per day for the subsequent cycles. After 37 patients were treated, the protocol was amended to reduce the dose of ponatinib to 30 mg per day at cycle 2, with further reduction to 15 mg once a complete molecular response (defined as absence of quantifiable BCR-ABL1 transcripts) was achieved. Patients in complete remission received maintenance with ponatinib daily (30 mg or 15 mg) indefinitely, and with vincristine (2 mg intravenously on day 1) and prednisone (200 mg orally on days 1-5) monthly for 2 years. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01424982, and is ongoing and still enrolling patients. FINDINGS: 76 patients with a median age of 47 years (IQR 39-61) were enrolled and treated between Nov 19, 2011, and April 4, 2018. The 3-year event-free survival was 70% (95% CI 56-80). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were infection (n=65, 86%), increased transaminases (n=24, 32%), increased bilirubin (n=13, 17%), pancreatitis (n=13, 17%), hypertension (n=12, 16%), bleeding (n=10, 13%), and skin rash (n=9, 12%). Six patients died while still on study treatment. Three patients (4%) died from infection and one (1%) from haemorrhage. Two patients died from myocardial infarction related to early ponatinib use; neither death occurred after protocol revision. INTERPRETATION: The combination of chemotherapy with ponatinib is effective in achieving long-term remission in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This regimen could represent a new standard of care for this population. A randomised, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy of this combination compared with chemotherapy plus earlier-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is warranted.

METHODS: Seventy-six patients with MDS-transformed AML treated in our hospital from June 2013 to June 2015 were selected according to treatment regimens, 76 patients were divided into 2 groups: CTG group(36 cases) and D+CTG group(40 cases). The patients in CTG group received treatment with Ara-C, THP and G-CSF; the patients received the treatment with decitabine plus CTG. The patients in 2 groups all received 4 course treatment, then received maintaining treatment. The therapeutic efficacy and incidence of adverse reactions in 2 group were compared, at the same time, the risk factors affecting the prognos of patients treated with D+CTG were analyzed. RESULTS: There were no siginificant differences in age, sex, initial blood cell count, bone marrow blast ratio, disease types, chromosome karyotypes and FLT3-ITD gene mutation between 2 groups. The efficacy analysis showed that the efficacy of D+CTG was superior to CTG, ORR in D+CTG group was significantly higher than that in CTG group (7252 vs 50%) (P<0.05), moreover, no significant differences in bone marrow inhibition digree infeetion, gastroinfestinal response and liver damage were found between 2 groups (P>0.05).

The high WBC count occurred more easily in AML (except MS) patients with positive expression of Tim-3, CD96 and CD123, but compared with AML patients with negative espression, the difference was not statstically significant (P>0.05). The proportion of chromosone karyotype with poor prognosis detected in patients with positive expression of Tim-3 and CD96 was higher than that in patients with negative expreesion (P<0.05); while the preoprtion of chromosome karyotype with poor prognosis detected in patients with positive and negative expression of CD123 was not significantly different (P>0.05). After 2 courses of chemotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rate in patients with positive expression of Tim-3, CD96 and CD123 was significantly lower than that in patients with negative expression of Tim-3, CD96 and CD123 (P<0.05), the comparison of OS time in patients with positive and negative expression of Tim-3 and CD96 showed the statistical difference (P>0.05), while the difference of OS time in patients with positive and negative expression of CD123 was not significant (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression levels of Tim-3, CD96 and CD123 in newly diagnosed AML (except M3) sybtype patients are not significantly different form those in total patients. The high WBC count ocours more easily in patients with positive expression of Tim-3, CD96 and CD123. After 2 course of chemotherapy, the CR rate in patients with positive expression of Tim-3, CD96 and CD123 was significantly lower than that in patients with negative expression. The proportion of chromsome karyotype with poor prognosis detected in patients with positive expression of Tim-3 and CD96 is high, moreover, OS time in patients with positive expression of Tim-3 and CD96 is shorter than that in patients with negative expression.","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China E-mail:haibindai@126.com.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expanding knowledge on essential cellular processes opens a new window for therapeutic targeting. Ribosome biogenesis is a process that shows potential due to its fundamental role in cell development and contribution to tumorigenesis as a result of its upregulation. Inhibiting components of ribosome biogenesis has been explored and has shown interesting results. Yet, an important key component, methyltransferase Fibrillarin (FBL), which influences both the abundance and composition of ribosomes, has not been exploited thus far. METHODS: In this literature review, we describe relevant aspects of ribosome biogenesis in cancer to emphasize the potential of FBL as a therapeutic target, in order to lower the genotoxic effects of anti-cancer treatment. RESULTS: Remarkably, the amplification of the 19q13 cytogenetic band, including the gene coding for FBL, correlated to cell viability and resistance in pancreatic cells as well as to a trend toward a shorter survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Targeting ribosome biogenesis, more specifically compared to the secondary effects of chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin, has been achieved by compound CX-5461. The cell dependent activity of this Pol I inhibitor has been reported in ovarian cancer, melanoma and leukemia models with active or mutated p53 status, presenting a promising mechanism to evade p53 resistance. CONCLUSION: Targeting critical ribosome biogenesis components in order to decrease the genotoxic activity in cancer cell looks promising. Hence, we believe that targeting key protein rRNA methyltransferase FBL shows great potential, due to its pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis, its correlation to an improved survival rate at low expression in breast cancer patients and its association with p53.","['Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center- Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1118, 1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center- Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1118, 1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'AIMMS-Division of Molecular Toxicology, Department of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, VU University Amsterdam, O|2 building, De Boelelaan 1108, 1081 HZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center- Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1118, 1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Lab, AIRC Start-Up Unit, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center- Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1118, 1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"Spermatogenesis is the process of the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to generate sperm. Leukemia patients show impairment in some of the endocrine hormones that are involved in spermatogenesis. They also show a decrease in semen parameters before and after thawing of cryopreserved samples compared to a control. The mechanisms behind these effects have not yet been described. This review summarizes the effect of leukemia on semen parameters from adult patients and highlights feasible suggested mechanisms that may affect impairment of spermatogenesis in these patients. We suggest the possible involvement of leukemia in disturbing hormones involved in spermatogenesis, and the imbalance in testicular paracrine/autocrine factors involved in the formation of SSC niches that control their proliferation and differentiation. Understanding the mechanisms of leukemia in the impairment of spermatogenesis may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies mainly for prepubertal boys who do not yet produce sperm.","['a The Shraga Segal Dept. of Microbiology, Immunology, and Genetics , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'b The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER) , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'c Faculty of Health Sciences , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'd IVF Unit , Barzilai Medical Center , Ashkelon , Israel.', 'b The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER) , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'c Faculty of Health Sciences , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'e Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , Soroka Medical Center , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'b The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER) , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'c Faculty of Health Sciences , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'f Department of Pediatric Oncology and Department of Hematology , Soroka Medical Center , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'a The Shraga Segal Dept. of Microbiology, Immunology, and Genetics , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'b The Center of Advanced Research and Education in Reproduction (CARER) , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'c Faculty of Health Sciences , Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'g The National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev , Beer-Sheva , Israel.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8644-6390'],20181203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 1.,"BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) since 2016 but has not been compared with chemoimmunotherapy. We conducted a phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib, either alone or in combination with rituximab, relative to chemoimmunotherapy. METHODS: Patients 65 years of age or older who had untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, ibrutinib, or ibrutinib plus rituximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. The Alliance Data and Safety Monitoring Board made the decision to release the data after the protocol-specified efficacy threshold had been met. RESULTS: A total of 183 patients were assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, 182 to receive ibrutinib, and 182 to receive ibrutinib plus rituximab. Median progression-free survival was reached only with bendamustine plus rituximab. The estimated percentage of patients with progression-free survival at 2 years was 74% with bendamustine plus rituximab and was higher with ibrutinib alone (87%; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.58; P<0.001) and with ibrutinib plus rituximab (88%; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.59; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the ibrutinib-plus-rituximab group and the ibrutinib group with regard to progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.62; P=0.49). With a median follow-up of 38 months, there was no significant difference among the three treatment groups with regard to overall survival. The rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 hematologic adverse events was higher with bendamustine plus rituximab (61%) than with ibrutinib or ibrutinib plus rituximab (41% and 39%, respectively), whereas the rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 nonhematologic adverse events was lower with bendamustine plus rituximab (63%) than with the ibrutinib-containing regimens (74% with each regimen). CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with untreated CLL, treatment with ibrutinib was superior to treatment with bendamustine plus rituximab with regard to progression-free survival. There was no significant difference between ibrutinib and ibrutinib plus rituximab with regard to progression-free survival.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by microarray. The candidate miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR at chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis. The functional analysis of miRNAs was carried out by using DAVID. RESULTS: The putative targets of dysregulated miRNAs were involved in important signaling pathways. Plasma let-7b-5p and miR-451a expression was lower in CML patients, and plasma miR-451a gradually decreased from chronic phase to accelerated phase and blast crisis. CONCLUSION: Dysregulated plasma miRNAs maybe play regulatory roles in pathogenesis of CML. Let-7b-5p and miR-451a can be used as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of CML.","['Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, PR China.', 'Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410008, PR China.', 'Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078, PR China.']",,20181203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found that RUNX1 localizes on active chromatin together with Far Upstream Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1) in human B-cell precursor lymphoblasts, and that both factors interact in the same transcriptional regulatory complex. RUNX1 and FUBP1 chromatin localization identified c-KIT as a common target gene. We characterized two regulatory regions, at +700 bp and +30 kb within the first intron of c-KIT, bound by both RUNX1 and FUBP1, and that present active histone marks. Based on these regions, we proposed a novel FUBP1 FUSE-like DNA-binding sequence on the +30 kb enhancer. We demonstrated that FUBP1 and RUNX1 cooperate for the regulation of the expression of the oncogene c-KIT. Notably, upregulation of c-KIT expression by FUBP1 and RUNX1 promotes cell proliferation and renders cells more resistant to the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate, a common therapeutic drug. These results reveal a new mechanism of action of RUNX1 that implicates FUBP1, as a facilitator, to trigger transcriptional regulation of c-KIT and to regulate cell proliferation. Deregulation of this regulatory mechanism may explain some oncogenic function of RUNX1 and FUBP1.","['Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44035 Nantes, France."", 'Ecole Centrale de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de recherche en sante, environnement et travail) - UMR_S 1085, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0RE, UK.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Genetique Somatique des Cancers, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 35033 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Department of pediatric oncohematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 35203 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France.']",,,,,,,PMC6265458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) cause immunodeficiency in cats; no association has been identified with critical cases of sporotrichosis. Moreover, the cytokine profile in Sporothrix-infected cats and a potential impact of retrovirus co-infections on their immunity is unknown. This study assessed immunological parameters in cats with sporotrichosis with and without FIV or FeLV co-infection. FeLV infection was detected by antigen ELISA and by provirus PCR. FIV infection was investigated through ELISA and Western blot. Cytokine transcription (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha) was quantified using RT-qPCR and lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4, CD8, CD5 and CD21) were assessed by flow cytometry. Thirty cats with sporotrichosis were recruited to the study, including three FIV-positive and five FeLV-positive (progressive infection) cats. One cat with regressive FeLV infection was excluded from statistics. In comparison to retrovirus-negative cats, FIV-positive cats and FeLV-positive cats had higher IL-10 levels, FeLV-positive cats had lower IL-4 levels and FIV-positive cats had lower IL-12 levels and a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Remarkably, all cats with poor general condition were FeLV (progressive infection) or FIV-positive, but the retrovirus status was not associated with the sporotrichosis treatment length or outcome. The immunological changes and the more severe clinical presentation observed in cats with retrovirus co-infections encourage future prospective studies that address the impact of these changes on prognostic determinants of feline sporotrichosis and the development of new therapy strategies that control disease spread.","['Laboratory of Clinical Research on Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals, Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Laboratory and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Immunoparasitology, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Laboratory and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research on Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals, Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research on Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals, Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Laboratory and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research on Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals, Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research on Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals, Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Laboratory and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3689-4109'],20181130,,,,,PMC6267967,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 20.,"The mixture of GX (guttiferone E and xanthochymol), an inseparable polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol (PPAP), showed moderate cytotoxic activities. The chemical transformation of GX yielded three different types of PPAPs (1, 2, and 3/4). A series of analogs were prepared, and the structures of the 40 newly synthesized compounds were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR and HR-ESI-MS. The derivatives were screened in vitro for antiproliferative activity against five human cancer cell lines: human leukemic cell lines (HEL and K562), cervical cancer cell line (Hela), human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), and human non-small cell lung cancer cell line (A549), using the MTT assay, and most of the derivatives showed good cytotoxic activities. Noticeably, compound 2, a novel tautomer with a hemiketal, exhibited selective cytotoxic activities against HEL (IC50=4.79+/-0.23muM) and K562 (IC50=7.69+/-0.34muM) leukemia cells. The mechanism studies indicated that compound 2 induced apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in the HEL cell line. Furthermore, compound 2 activated the intrinsic pathway by reducing the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and cell cycle-specific cyclin D1 and by enhancing the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Moreover, the caspase-3 and PPRP1 levels were also upregulated. Our present results suggest that compound 2 is a potential candidate for developing novel anti-leukemia agents in the future.","['State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; College of Basic Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550004, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University, Haikou, 571158, Hainan, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, PR China; College of Basic Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550004, PR China.

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify independent risk factors for non-home discharge in patients undergoing laminectomy for intradural extramedullary spinal tumors. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2011 to 2014. Adult patients who underwent laminectomy for the excision of intradural extramedullary spinal tumors were included and divided into 2 groups based on home or non-home discharge disposition. We compared baseline patient characteristics, comorbidities, and operative factors between the 2 groups, and then performed multivariate regression analyses to identify independent risk factors for non-home discharge. RESULTS: A total of 1232 patients were included, of whom 248 (20.1%) were discharged to a non-home facility. Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients discharged to a non-home facility were more frequently aged >/=65 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification >/=3 with obesity, diabetes, dyspnea, functional dependence, cardiac comorbidity, renal comorbidity, and anemia. Operative factors correlated with non-home discharge were operative time of >/=4 hours and tumor location in the cervical or thoracic spine. Multivariate regression analysis identified age >/=65 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.73; confidence interval [CI] 1.80-4.13; P < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification >/=3 (OR 2.36; CI 1.53-3.65; P < 0.001), dependent functional status (OR 4.30; CI 1.95-9.48; P < 0.001), hospital-acquired conditions (OR 2.32; CI 1.15-4.68; P = 0.019), and prolonged length of stay (OR 4.05; CI 2.72-6.03; P < 0.001) as predictors of non-home discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of patients at risk for non-home discharge is important in order to implement comprehensive discharge planning protocols that reduce inpatient length of stay, as well as associated complications and costs.","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'NeuroSpine Surgery Research Group (NSURG), Prince of Wales Private Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are an important tool to assess the impact of a new therapy on symptom burden and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies have been approved for use in relapsed or refractory leukemia and lymphoma based on promising efficacy in clinical trials. However, data are lacking on patient-reported toxicity and impact on HRQoL. This review provides an overview of the incorporation of PROs in CAR-T cell therapy and the specific challenges in this context. The first step is to demonstrate feasibility of PRO monitoring in the acute phase after CAR-T cell infusion. Apart from core PRO domains like physical functioning, disease-related symptoms, and symptomatic adverse effects, important measures to consider are cognitive functioning and financial toxicity. Because there are no validated PRO instruments in the setting of CAR-T cell therapy, universally validated measures like Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) could be considered, which is also recommended in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Given the timeline of toxicities with CAR-T cell therapy, PRO instruments should be administered at baseline and at least weekly in the first 30 days. Subsequently, frequent monitoring of PROs in the first year might be helpful in identifying short- and intermediate-term toxicities, functional limitations, and neuropsychiatric effects. The major potential challenge in acute phase would be missing data when patients develop severe cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity. Designing a strategy for handling missing data is crucial. The long-term safety of CAR-T cell therapy is not well characterized because of short follow-up in most studies reported thus far. PROs should be measured at least yearly after the first year to identify potential late effects like cognitive deficit or autoimmune manifestations. Collaboration between institutions performing cellular therapy and engagement with patients, clinicians, and statisticians with expertise in PROs are crucial for setting a comprehensive agenda on integration of PROs with CAR-T cell therapy.","['Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.

We found that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and JNK, but not ERK or P38, repress CNTF in vitro. Here, we defined the FAK-JNK pathway and its regulation of CNTF in mice, and the related leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which promote stem cell renewal at the expense of neurogenesis. Intrastriatal injection of FAK inhibitor, FAK14, in adult male C57BL/6 mice reduced pJNK and increased CNTF expression in the SVZ-containing periventricular region. Injection of a JNK inhibitor increased CNTF without affecting LIF and IL-6, and increased SVZ proliferation and neuroblast formation. The JNK inhibitor had no effect in CNTF-/- mice, suggesting that JNK inhibits SVZ neurogenesis by repressing CNTF. Inducible deletion of FAK in astrocytes increased SVZ CNTF and neurogenesis, but not LIF and IL-6. Intrastriatal injection of inhibitors suggested that P38 reduces LIF and IL-6 expression, whereas ERK induces CNTF and LIF. Intrastriatal FAK inhibition increased LIF, possibly through ERK, and IL-6 through another pathway that does not involve P38. Systemic injection of FAK14 also inhibited JNK while increasing CNTF, but did not affect P38 and ERK activation, or LIF and IL-6 expression. Importantly, systemic FAK14 increased SVZ neurogenesis in wild-type C57BL/6 and CNTF+/+ mice, but not in CNTF-/- littermates, indicating that it acts by upregulating CNTF. These data show a surprising differential regulation of related cytokines and identify the FAK-JNK-CNTF pathway as a specific target in astrocytes to promote neurogenesis and possibly neuroprotection in neurological disorders.","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9693-0012'],,,,"['AG029493/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG029493/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'RR0306551/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR030651/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6863602,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS1057927'],,,,,,,,,

Antiproliferative screening results showed that the 2-benzylthioquinoline nitrones 6e and 6f and the 2-methylthio analogues 6g and 6h exhibited promising antiproliferative activity especially against leukemia and colon cancer cell lines. Compounds 6c, 6e, and 6f exhibited higher potency as anticancer agents compared to doxorubicin, with IC50 ranging from 0.45 to 0.91 muM. A remarkable overexpression of caspase-3 protein levels was observed in cells treated with the tested compounds. Compound 6e exhibited more pre-G1 apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase than in other phases. These results revealed that the tested compounds can cause programmed cell death through overexpression of caspase 3, which may be attributed to the release of nitric oxide.","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Al-Azhar University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Al-Azhar University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Al-Azhar University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jouf University, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3908-1832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6834-6548']",20181130,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,"Flavonoids are a varied family of phytonutrients (plant chemicals) usually are detected in fruits and vegetables. In this big family, there exist more than 10,000 members that is separated into six chief subtypes: isoflavonols, flavonoenes, flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins, and chalcones. The natural compounds, such as fruits, have visible positive effects in regulating of survival involved signaling pathways that performance as the regulator of cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Researchers have established that commonly consumption up flavonoids decreases incidence and development risk of certain cancers, especially leukemia. Flavonoids have been able to induce apoptosis and stimulate cell cycle arrest in cancer cells via different pathways. Similarly, they have antiangiogenesis and antimetastasis capability, which were shown in wide ranges of cancer cells, particularly, leukemia. It seems that flavonoid because of their widespread approval, evident safety and low rate of side effects, have hopeful anticarcinogenic potential for leukemia therapy. Based on the last decade reports, the most important acting mechanisms of these natural compounds in leukemia cells are stimulating of apoptosis pathways by upregulation of caspase 3, 8, 9 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and proapoptotic proteins, particularly Bax activation. As well, they can induce cell cycle arrest in target cells not only via increasing of activated levels of p21 and p53 but also by inhibition of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, attenuation of neclear factor-kappaB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation, suppression of signaling pathway and downregulation of intracellular antiapoptotic proteins are other significant antileukemic function mechanism of flavonoids.

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,"BACKGROUND: Phenotypic characterization of immune cells in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is lacking. METHODS: T-cell infiltration was quantified on BM biopsies from 13 patients with AML, and flow cytometry was performed on BM aspirates (BMAs) from 107 patients with AML who received treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The authors evaluated the expression of inhibitory receptors (programmed cell death protein 1 [PD1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA4], lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM3]) and stimulatory receptors (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein [GITR], OX40, 41BB [a type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein receptor], inducible T-cell costimulatory [ICOS]) on T-cell subsets and the expression of their ligands (41BBL, B7-1, B7-2, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, and OX40L) on AML blasts. Expression of these markers was correlated with patient age, karyotype, baseline next-generation sequencing for 28 myeloid-associated genes (including P53), and DNA methylation proteins (DNA methyltransferase 3alpha, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1[IDH1], IDH2, Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 [TET2], and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3]). RESULTS: On histochemistry evaluation, the T-cell population in BM appeared to be preserved in patients who had AML compared with healthy donors. The proportion of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in BMAs was higher in patients with AML than in healthy donors. PD1-positive/OX40-positive T cells were more frequent in AML BMAs, and a higher frequency of PD1-positive/cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive T cells coexpressed TIM3 or LAG3. PD1-positive/CD8-positive T cells were more frequent in BMAs from patients who had multiply relapsed AML than in BMAs from those who had first relapsed or newly diagnosed AML. Blasts in BMAs from patients who had TP53-mutated AML were more frequently positive for PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: The preserved T-cell population, the increased frequency of regulatory T cells, and the expression of targetable immune receptors in AML BMAs suggest a role for T-cell-harnessing therapies in AML.","['Department of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Immunotherapy Platform, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Immunotherapy Platform, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Immunotherapy Platform, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplant and Cell Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Immunotherapy Platform, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Immunotherapy Platform, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5289-331X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0972-2766']",20181130,['Cancer. 2019 May 1;125(9):1410-1413.

It is unclear whether different methods produce similar results for estimates of radiation risk when applied to the same data. The goal of this study was to compare the radiation risk estimates for leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (non-CLL) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) produced by both Cox and Poisson regression models for time-dependent dose-response analyses of occupational exposure. Materials and Methods For brevity, this methods paper presents the results from one cohort, the Nuclear Power Plant workers (NPP), though the evaluation considered five cohorts of varying size and exposure as part of the Million Worker Study. Cox Proportional Hazards models, with age as the underlying timescale for hazard, were conducted using three computer software programs: SAS, R, and Epicure. Doses lagged 2 years for non-CLL and 10 years for ischemic heart disease were treated as time-dependent exposures at the annual level and were examined both in categories and as a continuous term. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported for each model in SAS and R, while the Peanuts program of Epicure was utilized to produce Excess Relative Risk (ERR) estimates and 95% CI. All models were adjusted for gender and year of birth. Four piece-wise exponential Poisson models (log-linear regression for rate) were developed with varying cutpoints for age strata from very fine to broad categories using both R and the Amfit program in Epicure for ERR estimates. Results Comparable estimates of risk (both RR and ERR) were observed from Cox and Poisson models, regardless of software utilized, as long as appropriately narrow categories of age were utilized to control the confounding of age in Poisson models. The ERR estimates produced in Epicure tended to agree very closely with the HR or RR estimates, and the statistical software program used had no impact to risk estimates for the same model. Conclusions As computational power is no longer the burden today as it has been in the past, the results of this evaluation support the use of the Cox proportional hazards or the ungrouped Poisson approach to analyzing time-dependent dose-response relationships to ensure that maximum control over the confounding of age is achieved in studies of mortality for cohorts occupationally exposed to radiation.","['a Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge , Tennessee , USA.', 'b EpidStat Institute, Ann Arbor , Michigan , USA.', 'c Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine , Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center , Nashville , Tennessee , USA.', 'a Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge , Tennessee , USA.', 'c Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine , Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center , Nashville , Tennessee , USA.', 'd National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements , Bethesda , Maryland , USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9430-7702', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2871-1587']",20181130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,"In clinical practice, patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are usually classified in low or high-risk groups to take therapeutic decisions, conservative for low-risk, whereas active for high-risk. Nevertheless, in the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) is not well stated which patients are low or high-risk. This study was aimed to ascertain in 364 MDS patients which IPSS-R threshold better dichotomized in low vs. high-risk. The best dichotomization was obtained with an IPSS-R cut-point of 3. Accordingly, 68% patients were classified as low-risk (median OS, 61.3 months) and 32% as high-risk MDS (median OS, 13.9 months) (p < .001). Interestingly, the intermediate IPSS-R risk patients presented an OS more related to the high IPSS-R than to the low IPSS-R risk group. In conclusion, an IPSS-R cut-point of 3 led to a meaningful stratification in low and high-risk that can be helpful for the clinical management of MDS patients.","[""a Department of Hematology , University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB) , Spain."", ""b Experimental Hematology Unit , Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) , Barcelona , Spain."", ""c Department of Hematology , Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO) - Hospitalet , Barcelona , Spain."", ""d Oncology Data Science (ODysSey) Group , Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Department of Hematology , University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB) , Spain."", ""b Experimental Hematology Unit , Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) , Barcelona , Spain."", ""a Department of Hematology , University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB) , Spain."", ""b Experimental Hematology Unit , Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) , Barcelona , Spain."", 'e Department of Pathology , Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge , Barcelona , Spain Hospitalet.', ""a Department of Hematology , University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB) , Spain."", ""b Experimental Hematology Unit , Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) , Barcelona , Spain."", 'f Department of Laboratory Hematology , University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.

Clonal eosinophilia is also seen in a wide variety of hematopoietic neoplasms, and sub-classification can be diagnostically challenging. A proper evaluation of persistent eosinophilia involves correlation of clinical history, laboratory data, cellular morphology, and ancillary testing. Knowledge of appropriate ancillary testing is necessary for a timely diagnosis. We present a review of the literature regarding eosinophilia, including the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) update of WHO-defined eosinophilic disorders. We also present a review of eosinophilia in a case-based format including guidelines for evaluation of both routine and challenging cases. The purpose of this guideline is not to provide an in-depth discussion of each diagnosis, but rather a practical method that all pathologists can utilize to investigate eosinophilia.","['Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1297-7858'],20181130,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 13.,"One of the most promising developments in therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in recent years has been the combination of hypomethylating agents (HMA, either decitabine or 5-azacytidine) with the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN). Although both classes of drugs have single-agent activity in AML, the combination has resulted in high rates of complete remission (CR) both in the frontline and relapsed settings suggesting synergy between these two agents. Recent data have suggested that CR + CR with incomplete count recovery rate may exceed 70% for frontline VEN-HMA. Moreover, this activity has been observed across various genetic subtypes of AML including those known to have very poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Although VEN has only recently obtained FDA approval for treatment of AML, there has been increasing on and off-label use of this combination given its striking efficacy and excellent toxicity profile. In this article, we summarize the current available data on this combination and offer practical guidelines for management of patients receiving VEN-HMA. Our recommendations are based on protocol guidelines, published data from clinical trials as well as from analysis of real world evidence from patients treated with this combination.","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9129-3424'],20181213,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

T-ALL also shows aberrant markers such as CD13, CD33, CD117, CD10, and CD79a. Morphologically, T-ALL has been categorized into L1, L2, and L3 subtypes. Till now, no study has been done to correlate these markers with morphological features of T-ALL. This study aimed to correlate the expression of aberrant immunophenotypic markers with morphology in T-ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the cases of T-ALL diagnosed by flow cytometry over a period of 2(1/2) year were taken out from the records of Hematology Section of Department of Pathology of University College of Medical Science and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and Max Hospital, Saket. Their peripheral blood smear was screened to correlate the morphology of blasts with the expression of aberrant markers. RESULTS: A total of 40 cases of T-ALL were identified during 2(1/2) year period of our study. Morphological correlation was available for 23 cases. Aberrant expression of CD10 was present in 6 (35.3%) cases, CD79a in 9 (47.36%) cases, CD117 in 5 (42.28%) cases and myeloid antigen CD33 in 5 (38.46%) cases. CD117 and CD33-positive cases showed L2 morphology with the presence of convolutions, while cases with expression of CD79a had L1 morphology with absent-slight convolutions. CD10-positive cases had L1/L2 morphology with absent occasionally present convolutions. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be an association of aberrant markers with L1 and L2 morphology. However, this needs to be tested for statistical significance on a larger sample size.","['Departments of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, India.', 'Departments of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Max Hospital Saket, New Delhi, India.', 'Departments of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, India.', 'Departments of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, India.']",,,,,,,PMC6210842,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim: The aim of the study is to analyse the cytological features of neoplastic meningitis in a tertiary care center. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 400 consecutive CSF samples was done in the cytology laboratory of our hospital. The fluid obtained by spinal tap was sent for microbiological, biochemical and cytological evaluation. Smears that showed the presence of malignant cells were included in this study. Results: Out of 400 cases, 36 (9%) showed neoplastic meningitis. Of which, 13 cases (36%) revealed leukemic infiltration, 2 (6%) lymphomatous infiltration and 21 (58%) carcinomatous meningitis. The leukemia cases included seven cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and six cases of acute myeloid leukemia. Among the carcinomatous meningitis cases, eight were metastasis from carcinoma breast, six from lung carcinoma and one each from malignancies of gallbladder, stomach and retinoblastoma. Four cases were metastatic adenocarcinoma from unknown primary. Pleocytosis was a significant finding seen in 58% cases (n = 21). Elevated protein and hypoglychorrhachia was noted in 68% cases (n = 18). Conclusion: A combined diagnostic approach including biochemical, microbiological and pathological evaluation was useful in eliminating infectious meningitis and confirming neoplastic meningitis in these cases. Cytology should be performed on cerebrospinal specimens from all patients with known or suspected malignancy with meningismus. Detection of malignant cells on cytological examination of CSF is the diagnostic gold standard for neoplastic meningitis.","['Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Cellular Pathology, Leighton Hospital, Crewe, Cheshire, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,PMC6210820,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of mature B cells driven by B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and activated primarily in the lymph node. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib effectively inhibits BCR-dependent proliferation and survival signals and has emerged as a breakthrough therapy for CLL. However, complete remissions are uncommon and are achieved only after years of continuous therapy. We hypothesized that other signaling pathways that sustain CLL cell survival are only partially inhibited by ibrutinib. In normal B cells, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cooperates with BCR signaling to activate prosurvival NF-kappaB. Here, we show that an experimentally validated gene signature of TLR activation is overexpressed in lymph node-resident CLL cells compared with cells in the blood. Consistent with TLR activation, we detected phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, STAT1, and STAT3 in lymph node-resident CLL cells and in cells stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides in vitro. CpG promoted IRAK1 degradation, secretion of IL10, and extended survival of CLL cells in culture. CpG-induced TLR signaling was significantly inhibited by both an IRAK1/4 inhibitor and ibrutinib. Although inhibition of TLR signaling was incomplete with either drug, the combination achieved superior results, including more effective inhibition of TLR-mediated survival signaling. Our data suggest an important role for TLR signaling in CLL pathogenesis and in sustaining the viability of CLL cells during ibrutinib therapy. The combination of ibrutinib with a TLR pathway inhibitor could provide superior antitumor activity and should be investigated in clinical studies. SIGNIFICANCE: CLL relies on the concomitant cooperation of B-cell receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling; inhibition of both pathways is superior to inhibition of either pathway alone.

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"There is a pressing need for more effective therapies to treat patients with T-cell lymphomas (TCLs), including first-line approaches that increase the response rate to cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy. We characterized the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TCL and assessed the in vitro efficacy of BH3 mimetics, including the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, the BCL2/BCL-xL inhibitor navitoclax, and the novel MCL1 inhibitor AZD5991. The abundance of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members based on immunoblotting or RNA transcript levels correlated poorly with the activity of BH3 mimetics. In contrast, the functional approach BH3 profiling reliably predicted sensitivity to BH3 mimetics in vitro and in vivo. We used BH3 profiling to select TCL PDX that were dependent on MCL1. Mice xenografted with these PDX and treated with AZD5991 had markedly improved survival. The combination of AZD5991 and CHOP achieved synergy based on survival improvement beyond a mathematical ""sum of benefits"" model. Thus, MCL1 inhibition is a promising strategy as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy for patients with TCL and functional dependence on MCL1.","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Bioscience, Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Chao Family Comprehensive Center Center, UC Irvine Health, Orange, CA.', 'LifeMine Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Bioscience, Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Boston, MA.', 'Bioscience, Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Boston, MA.', 'Bioscience, Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2018-5685', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5028-7028', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4218-1693', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9682-4164', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6692-1062', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8724-3907']",20181129,['Blood. 2019 Feb 7;133(6):504-506.

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"Autophagy maintains hematopoietic stem cell integrity and prevents malignant transformation. In addition to bulk degradation, selective autophagy serves as an intracellular quality control mechanism and requires autophagy receptors, such as p62 (SQSTM1), to specifically bridge the ubiquitinated cargos into autophagosomes. Here, we investigated the function of p62 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vitro and in murine in vivo models of AML. Loss of p62 impaired expansion and colony-forming ability of leukemia cells and prolonged latency of leukemia development in mice. High p62 expression was associated with poor prognosis in human AML. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified enrichment of mitochondrial proteins upon immunoprecipitation of p62. Loss of p62 significantly delayed removal of dysfunctional mitochondria, increased mitochondrial superoxide levels, and impaired mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we demonstrated that the autophagy-dependent function of p62 is essential for cell growth and effective mitochondrial degradation by mitophagy. Our results highlight the prominent role of selective autophagy in leukemia progression, and specifically, the importance of mitophagy to maintain mitochondrial integrity.","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cambridge University Department of Hematology, Cambridge Institute of Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology & Neuroscience and.', 'Institute of Molecular Biosciences and Cluster of Excellence Macromolecular Complexes, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Munich, Germany; and.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences and.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5770-1279', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2276-8128', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6570-6125', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0360-6994', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9184-7607', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3832-090X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8156-9511', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1732-2535']",20181129,,['Blood. 2019 Jul 4;134(1):94.

Epub 2018 Nov 20.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify and characterize constitutional chromosomal rearrangements that mimic recurrent genetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Bone marrow and blood chromosome studies were reviewed to identify constitutional rearrangements that resemble those designated by the 2017 revised World Health Organization (WHO) ""AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities"". Mate-pair sequencing (MPseq) was performed on cases with constitutional chromosome mimics of recurrent AML abnormalities to further define the rearrangement breakpoints. RESULTS: Three cases with constitutional rearrangements were identified, including t(6;9)(p23;q34), inv(16)(p13.1q22), and t(9;22)(q34.1;q12.2). Two cases were bone marrow specimens being evaluated for hematologic neoplasms, while one case was a blood specimen being evaluated for primary ovarian insufficiency. MPseq provided high-resolution and precise rearrangement breakpoints, and resolved the atypical FISH results generated with each rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that constitutional rearrangements can mimic recurrent genetic abnormalities observed in AML, and we emphasize the importance of correlating genetic data with clinical and hematopathologic information.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, United States.

Few studies have used a Likert-type scale to measure medication adherence in CML and MM patients. We applied a validated treatment adherence tool, the ASK-12 (Adherence Starts with Knowledge((R))) survey, which assessed inconvenience and forgetfulness, treatment beliefs, and medication-taking behaviors recorded on a five-point Likert-type scale at two visits. RESULTS: A medication adherence survey was administered to 42 newly diagnosed or pre-existing CML or MM patients at two outpatient oncology clinics affiliated with an academic medical center in rural eastern North Carolina. Thirty-one patients completed surveys at visit 1 and visit 2 (median 4.5 months apart). Most patients were treated for MM (65%), were non-Hispanic black (68%) and female (58%). Within subscales, mean adherence scores decreased between visits, signaling better adherence. Overall, visit scores were correlated (0.63, p = 0.001). Forgetting to take medication sometimes was the most common reason for non-adherence. Medication costs were not a barrier for MM patients. Greater patient-provider informed decision-making was identified as an opportunity for quality improvement among CML patients.

METHODS: By using a DCIS-derived cell line, we evaluated the effects of low oxygen availability on malignant features of non-invasive breast tumor cells and the possible role of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a well-known anti-leukemic drug, in counteracting the effects of hypoxia. The involvement of the beta2 isoform of PI-PLC (PLC-beta2), an ATRA target in myeloid leukemia cells, was also investigated by specific modulation of the protein expression. RESULTS: We demonstrated that moderate hypoxia is sufficient to induce, in DCIS-derived cells, motility, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and expression of the stem cell marker CD133, indicative of their increased malignant potential. Administration of ATRA supports the epithelial-like phenotype of DCIS-derived cells cultured under hypoxia and keeps down the number of CD133 positive cells, abrogating almost completely the effects of poor oxygenation. We also found that the mechanisms triggered by ATRA in non-invasive breast tumor cells cultured under hypoxia is in part mediated by PLC-beta2, responsible to counteract the effects of low oxygen availability on CD133 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we assigned to hypoxia a role in increasing the malignant potential of DCIS-derived cells and we identified in ATRA, currently used in treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), an agonist potentially useful in preventing malignant progression of non-invasive breast lesions showing hypoxic areas.","['Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 70, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'College of Medicine, Department of Anatomy, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 70, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 70, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 70, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 70, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 70, 44121, Ferrara, Italy. bgv@unife.it.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4742-2302'],20181129,,,['FIRB RBAP10Z7FS_002/Italian MIUR'],,PMC6267073,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the initial pre-treatment platelet count (PPC) could interfere with TPR. Here, we integrated both TPR and PPC as the average daily platelet amount increase (Ap) to predict the prognosis in childhood B-ALL during the recovery period.148 patients were enrolled. The relationship between the Ap and MRD was evaluated, and Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate whether Ap was independently associated with a better EFS. The PPC was inversely correlated with TPR (rs = -0.519, P = 0.021). Patients in Ap >3.9 x 10(9)/L group had better EFS (x(2) = 3.109, P = 0.028) than TPR </= 16d.

However, when introducing both MRD and Ap > 3.9 x 10(9)/L as candidate variables, the Ap > 3.9 x 10(9)/L lost its independent effect (P = 0.081).

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) caused by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression is a serious obstacle to the treatment of chronic myelocytic leukemia. In recent years, some clinical trials have shown that nelfinavir (NFV), a traditional anti-HIV drug, has anti-cancer effects. Some researchers have also shown NFV might be a potential P-gp inhibitor. This study is aimed at investigating whether nelfinavir can act as an MDR-reversal drug and to clarify its molecular mechanism as well. METHODS: K562 and K562/ADR cell lines were applied in the study. Cytotoxicity was detected by CCK-8 reagents. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and inverted fluorescence microscopy to detect the binding of apoptotic dyes to cells. Western blot was used to detect the expression of proteins. Drug-protein molecular docking simulation by using Sybyl-x 2.0 software. RESULTS: Non-toxic concentrations of NFV (1.25-5 muM) could reverse Adriamycin (ADR), colchicine, paclitaxel, and imatinib resistance of K562/ADR cells, with reversal indexes of up to 10.8, 7.4, 57, and 9.3, respectively. NFV inhibited P-gp efflux function, as evidenced by the significant increase in the intracellular accumulation of ADR and Rho-123, without affecting P-gp protein and mRNA expression levels. Further ATP content detection and molecular docking simulations showed that NFV could decrease intracellular ATP content and has a high affinity with the active functional regions of P-gp, respectively. When co-administered with ADR, NFV increased intracellular reactive oxygen species as well as blocked the ERK/Akt signaling pathway, leading to cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: NFV inhibited P-gp function, decreased intracellular ATP content, and promoted cell apoptosis in K562/ADR cells, thereby reversing MDR. These findings encourage further animal and clinical MDR studies with a combination therapy consisting of NFV and chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Chinamengq531@163.com.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Chinamengq531@163.com.', 'Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Provincial Key Laboratory for Pharmacokinetics and Transport, Liaoning Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.']",,20181129,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

We evaluated the NK cell density in bone marrow core biopsies performed an average of 14 days after NK cell transfer using a CD56 immunohistochemical stain. The NK cell density in core biopsies showed only moderate correlation with NK cell percentage in bone marrow aspirates evaluated by flow cytometry (rs=0.48) suggesting that distribution of CD56 cells in the bone marrow niche offers unique insight into NK cell homing. Better leukemia control was associated with increased NK cell density, such that patients with <5% blasts had a higher NK cell density (P=0.01). As well, NK cell density above the median of reference group was significantly associated with morphologic remission of leukemia (P=0.01). Moreover, the NK cell density varied significantly between conditioning protocols. Our findings suggest that the use of low-dose irradiation or CD25-targeting immunocytokine (denileukin diftitox, IL2DT) as part of conditioning results in increased NK cell homing/persistence in the bone marrow. These novel results will help guide future immunotherapy with NK cells.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'Masonic Cancer Center Biostatistics Core.', 'Adult Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Adult Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Adult Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.']",,,,,"['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN268201000008C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000114/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA111412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6365204,,,,,['NIHMS1510551'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 10.,"Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein is the best-characterized member of SET family of histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, known for its transcriptional-activation role during development. mll gene rearrangements cause multiple kinds of aggressive leukemia in both children and adults. An important 'first' step in understanding the role of MLL in leukemogenesis would be to identify its localization throughout the cell cycle. In order to fully understand the breath of MLL functions in proliferating cells, we have analyzed its sub-cellular localization during the cell cycle. Our results show that MLL localizes to nucleolus and centrosome in interphase. During mitosis, it localizes to centrosomes and midbody in addition to previously reported spindle apparatus. Our results show that MLLN is required to translocate MLLC to the nucleolus. These finding suggest functional roles for MLL in nucleolus and mitosis. We also show how MLL-fusion proteins (MLL-FPs) localize to the same sub-cellular organelles like endogenous MLL. Our results indicate that MLL-fusion proteins may not only disturb the cell homeostasis by gain-of-function of the chimeric protein, but also by interfering with the functions of endogenous MLL.","['a Laboratory of Cell Cycle Regulation , Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) , Uppal , Hyderabad 500039 , India.', 'b Graduate Studies , Manipal Academy of Higher Education , Manipal , India.', 'a Laboratory of Cell Cycle Regulation , Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) , Uppal , Hyderabad 500039 , India.', 'b Graduate Studies , Manipal Academy of Higher Education , Manipal , India.', 'a Laboratory of Cell Cycle Regulation , Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) , Uppal , Hyderabad 500039 , India.', 'b Graduate Studies , Manipal Academy of Higher Education , Manipal , India.', 'a Laboratory of Cell Cycle Regulation , Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) , Uppal , Hyderabad 500039 , India.', 'a Laboratory of Cell Cycle Regulation , Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) , Uppal , Hyderabad 500039 , India.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8349-6843'],20181210,,,,,PMC6343706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"Aims: Survivin is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis and the regulation of cell division. In addition to wild-type survivin (survivin-wt), at least four splice variants with differential functions (DeltaEx3 and 3B antiapoptotic, and 2alpha and 2B proapoptotic) have been identified. Survivin is highly expressed in several cancers, including hematological malignancies. Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent malignancy in children, studies that investigated survivin expression in ALL are limited, and there is no study on 3B and 2alpha expression in ALL. Therefore the expression of survivin-wt and its splice variants was investigated in pediatric B-cell ALL patients. Materials and Methods: The expression of survivin-wt and its four splice variants was investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in archival RNA samples of 35 pediatric B-cell ALL patients. Patients were divided into high- and standard-risk groups according to age, white blood cell count, extramedullary involvement, and genetic risk factors; expression of survivin variants was compared between these two risk groups. Results: We found that the ratio of survivin-DeltaEx3/wild type (WT) expression was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group. Conclusion: Comparative analysis between the high- and low-risk B-cell ALL groups indicated that the survivin-DeltaEx3/WT expression ratio could potentially be used in risk classification for pediatric B-cell ALL.","['Central Laboratory, Biotechnology Institute, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istinye University, Medicalpark Bahcelievler Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Duzen Laboratories Group, Division of Medical Genetics, Ankara, Turkey.']",,20181129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 21.,"OBJECTIVES: Efforts are being made worldwide to prevent abandonment in children with leukaemia. The study aimed to determine changes in treatment refusal, treatment abandonment rates, and its reasons in response to financial support and focussed group counselling. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study conducted at paediatric haematology-oncology unit, King George's Medical University, Lucknow among children <18 years admitted with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia from 1995 to 2017. Study divided into three periods: Phase 1 (1995-March 2003): Basic support, Phase 2 (April 2003-June 2009): Financial support and Phase 3 (July 2009-2017): Financial, social support with group counselling. Phase 3- subdivided into 3a: group counselling and 3b: intensified group counselling. RESULTS: Number of children registered for treatment during phase 1, 2, 3a, 3b: 176, 200, 360, and 305. Treatment refusal decreased significantly over time: 21% vs 14.5% vs 12.5% vs 5.9% (P < 0.001), especially during phase 3b. Although no change was found in treatment abandonment during phase 2, abandonment significantly reduced in phase 3a (20.3%) as compared with phase 1 (30.2%), with the proportion of children abandoning, due to financial constraints, declining. Abandonment further reduced in phase 3b vs phase 3a (11.1% vs 20.3%) (P = 0.001). After adjusting for other variables, abandonment was found to decrease independently in phase3 (a, b) as compared with phase 1 (P1 = 0.017, P2 = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Although helpful, financial assistance unaccompanied by counselling may be insufficient to bring a radical change. Hence, parental counselling, emphasising on treatment adherence and the aftermaths of treatment abandonment, is indispensable for preventing abandonment in semi-literate populations.","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8564-7051'],20181221,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The current treatments against cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, but these come with varied side effects as they harm noncancer cells too. Therefore, search for new treatments is one of the important research areas nowadays and nanoparticles are one such potential anticancer agent. Aim of the Study: We hypothesized that silver nanoparticles and tea extract may have anticancer activities along with their synergistic counterparts with adriamycin (ADR) on HT-29 human colon cancer cell line, MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, and MOLT-4 human leukemia cancer cell line. Materials and Methods: The biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, nanoparticle tracking analyzer (NTA), X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared analysis. The cytotoxic activity was measured using the sulforhodamine B assay protocol on the HT-29, MCF-7, and MOLT-4 cell lines. Results: The synthesized AgNPs gave absorption maxima at 415 nm, with four different diffraction peaks ( degrees 2theta values) corresponding to the face centered cubic silver lines. Our results showed that AgNPs exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity at 20 mug/mL concentration against all the three cell lines followed by the combination of AgNPs+ADR. Conclusion: The superior activity of the silver nanoparticles may be due to its spherical shape and smaller particle size 10-30 nm as confirmed from NTA and TEM analysis. The data obtained in the study reveal the potent therapeutic value of biogenic silver nanoparticles.","['Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Science, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",,,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a sequential optimization strategy was used to determine the best culture conditions for L-asparaginase production from filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus CCT 7693 by submerged fermentation. The cultural conditions were studied using a 3-level, central composite design of response surface methodology, and biomass and enzyme production were optimized separately.

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,"BACKGROUND: Pegylated asparaginase (P-Asp) though integral to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy is often not accessible to patients in developing countries. We share our clinical experience with generic P-Asp along with monitoring of asparaginase activity. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, patients </=18 years of age with ALL were assigned to receive either generic P-Asp or native asparaginase (N-Asp) in a non-randomized manner. Treatment protocol was based on ALL BFM-95 backbone. The dose of P-Asp was 1500 IU/m(2) by intravenous route during induction (Ia) and re-induction (IIa) phase of therapy. RESULTS: N-Asp or P-Asp was administered to 52 and 54 of the 106 eligible patients respectively. Demographic and disease characteristics were comparable in both arms. The mean trough levels for N-Asp and P-Asp were 156.87 +/- 22.35 IU/L and 216.03 +/- 73.40 IU/L, respectively (p value <0.001) and all patients achieved therapeutic levels during Ia. Incidence of asparaginase-attributable toxicity was similar in the two arms in both phases of treatment, although hospitalization due to noninfectious causes was more common in P-Asp arm during Ia (13% versus 0%, p value, 0.01). Clinical hypersensitivity and silent inactivation were not observed during Ia while these occurred in 13% and 5% of patients in the N-Asp arm and P-Asp arms of IIa, respectively. The 2-year event free survival for P-Asp and N-Asp groups was 84% and 80.7%, respectively (p value 0.85). CONCLUSION: Generic P-Asp was observed to be efficacious and well tolerated in our patients and adequate therapeutic levels were sustained for 2 weeks.","['a Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology , Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology , Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology , Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre , New Delhi , India.', 'c Department of Laboratory Services, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'b Department of Research , Sir Ganga Ram Hospital , New Delhi , India.']",,20181129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"PURPOSE: High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is critical to the successful treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but can cause significant toxicities. This study prospectively evaluated the effectiveness of a fixed algorithm which requires no real-time pharmacokinetic modeling and no previous patient exposure to HDMTX, to individualize HDMTX dosing for at-risk patients with the aim of avoiding methotrexate-related toxicities. METHODS: We developed a simple algorithm to individualize HDMTX infusions with 0-2 rate adjustments based on methotrexate levels during the infusion. This was a prospective, open-label, study; eligible patients were identified and referred by their oncologist. RESULTS: Fifty-four evaluable cycles of HDMTX (5 g/m(2) over 24 h) were administered to 22 patients. Blood samples were obtained in 21 patients to examine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to methotrexate disposition. Twelve (54.5%) subjects had a history of previous HDMTX toxicities including seven (31.8%) who previously required glucarpidase rescue and seven (31.8%) with an entry glomerular filtration rate < 80 ml/min/1.73 m(2). 107/110 (97.2%) of methotrexate levels were drawn properly and 100% of algorithm dosing instructions were performed correctly at the bedside. Thirty-five (64.8%) of all cycles and 24 of 33 (72.7%) cycles that required a dose-adjustment had an end 24-h methotrexate level (Cpss) within our goal range of 65 +/- 15 microM with only 3 (5.6%) resulting in Cpss higher than goal. Grade 3/4 toxicities were rare; no patients developed > Grade 1 acute kidney injury. CONCLUSION: This algorithm is a simple, safe and effective method for individualizing HDMTX in pediatric patients with ALL. CLINICALTRIALS.

Patients who undergone HSCT are at increased risk of infection due to impaired immunity. Objective: To evaluate the rate of bacterial, viral and fungal infection and its relationship with 2-year overall survival of AML patients who had undergone HSCT. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of 49 patients who underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from full-matched donors at BMT Center, Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran, Iran, from 2006 to 2013. All autologous transplantations and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) transplantations were excluded. Results: All patients, except for one, had fever for a mean of 7 days post-transplantation and received broad-spectrum antibiotic. The rate of severe sepsis was 6.1%. None of the patients developed fungal infection during admission. The rate of admission due to sepsis after discharge was 27% in the alive group (mean onset of 54 days), and 73% in the deceased group (mean onset of 52 days) (p<0.05). The most common site of infection was lung (70%). The rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia (positive PP65) was 20% during the 2-year period after HSCT. Conclusion: The rate of infection was a negative prognostic factor for 2-year overall survival. The rate of CMV antigenemia is less than similar studies (51%), which could be due to full-matched donor-recipients requiring less immunosuppression.","['Assisstant Professor of Hematology Oncology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Associated Professor of Hematology Oncology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Fellowship of Hematology Oncology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Associated Professor of Hematology Oncology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Internal Medicine Specialist Tehran University of Medical Sciences.', 'Researcher at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,20180801,,,,,PMC6252176,['None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aging has a profound impact in the frequency, phenotype and function of NK cells. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL gene formation encoding aberrant oncoprotein tyrosine kinase. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induces durable deep molecular response. The response to treatment and life expectancy is lower in older patients with chronic phase of CML than in younger patients. In this work we analyse NK cells from TKI-treated CML patients and healthy controls stratified according to age. We have analyzed the expression of NK receptors, activation markers, NK cell differentiation in CD56(bright) and CD56(dim) NK cell subsets and the expression of CD107a and IFN-gamma in NK cells stimulated with K562. Whereas significant differences on the phenotype and function of NK cells were found between middle-aged (35-65 years old) and elderly (older than 65) healthy individuals, NK cells from TKI-treated CML patients do not show significant differences related with age in most parameters studied, indicating that age is not a limitation of the NK cell recovery after treatment with TKI. Our results also revealed differences in the expression of NK receptors, activation markers and functional assays in NK cells from TKI-treated CML patients compared with age-matched healthy controls. These results highlight the relevance of NK cells in TKI-treated patients and the need of an extensive analysis of the effect of aging on NK cell phenotype and function in these patients in order to define new NK-cell based strategies directed to control CML progression and achieve long-term disease remission after TKI cessation.","['Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Immunology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Oncology, Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Center of Investigation in Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology - CIMAGO, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Department of Immunology, Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba - Reina Sofia University Hospital - University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Oncology, Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Center of Investigation in Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology - CIMAGO, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Hematology Service, Coimbra Hospital and Universitary Centre, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Oncology, Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Center of Investigation in Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology - CIMAGO, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Immunology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Center of Investigation in Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology - CIMAGO, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Department of Immunology, Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba - Reina Sofia University Hospital - University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba - Reina Sofia University Hospital - University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Immunology Unit, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Coimbra Hospital and Universitary Centre, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Department of Immunology, Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba - Reina Sofia University Hospital - University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Immunology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Center of Investigation in Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology - CIMAGO, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.']",,20181108,,,,,PMC6246921,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to assess when the CRLF2-r; IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-CRLF2, arose during the evolution of both Down syndrome-ALL (DS-ALL) and non-DS-ALL. Using fluorescence in situ hybridisation, we were able to track up to four structural variants in single cells from 47 CRLF2-r B-ALL patients, which in association with our multiplex single-cell analysis of a further four patients, permitted simultaneous tracking of copy number alterations, structural and single nucleotide variants within individual cells. We observed CRLF2-r arising as both early and late events in DS and non-DS-ALL patients. Parallel evolution of discrete clones was observed in the development of CRLF2-r B-ALL, either involving the CRLF2-r or one of the other tracked abnormalities. In-depth single-cell analysis identified both linear and branching evolution with early clones harbouring a multitude of abnormalities, including the CRLF2-r in DS-ALL patients.","['The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. lisa.russell@newcastle.ac.uk.']",,20181128,,,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '105104/Z/14/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,PMC6398588,,,,,['EMS79778'],,,,,,,,,

GvHD is caused by T cells within the allograft attacking nonmalignant host tissues; however, these same T cells mediate the therapeutic graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) response. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how to mechanistically uncouple GvL from GvHD. Using preclinical models of full and partial MHC-mismatched HCT, we here show that the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced by allogeneic T cells distinguishes between the two processes. GM-CSF drives GvHD pathology by licensing donor-derived phagocytes to produce inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1beta and reactive oxygen species. In contrast, GM-CSF did not affect allogeneic T cells or their capacity to eliminate leukemic cells, retaining undiminished GvL responses. Last, tissue biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with grade IV GvHD showed an elevation of GM-CSF-producing T cells, suggesting that GM-CSF neutralization has translational potential in allo-HCT.","['Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland. tugues@immunology.uzh.ch becher@immunology.uzh.ch.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'INSERM U1043-CNRS UMR 5282, Physiopathology Center of Toulouse-Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Neurology Clinic, University Hospital of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Veterinary Pathology, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg University Medical Center, 79110 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases, Freiburg University Medical Center, 79110 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Molecular Mechanisms of Disease, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University and University Hospital 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg University Medical Center, 79110 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology,University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland. tugues@immunology.uzh.ch becher@immunology.uzh.ch.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1206-3386', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1708-0452', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2689-1951', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9949-2230', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1107-6516', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7323-2270', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9489-3692', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4676-7931', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6565-3393', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1541-7867']",,['Nat Rev Immunol. 2019 Jan;19(1):4-5.

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"Most B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) can be classified into known major genetic subtypes, while a substantial proportion of BCP ALL remains poorly characterized in relation to its underlying genomic abnormalities. We therefore initiated a large-scale international study to reanalyze and delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 BCP ALL cases using RNA sequencing. Fourteen BCP ALL gene expression subgroups (G1 to G14) were identified. Apart from extending eight previously described subgroups (G1 to G8 associated with MEF2D fusions, TCF3-PBX1 fusions, ETV6-RUNX1-positive/ETV6-RUNX1-like, DUX4 fusions, ZNF384 fusions, BCR-ABL1/Ph-like, high hyperdiploidy, and KMT2A fusions), we defined six additional gene expression subgroups: G9 was associated with both PAX5 and CRLF2 fusions; G10 and G11 with mutations in PAX5 (p.P80R) and IKZF1 (p.N159Y), respectively; G12 with IGH-CEBPE fusion and mutations in ZEB2 (p.H1038R); and G13 and G14 with TCF3/4-HLF and NUTM1 fusions, respectively. In pediatric BCP ALL, subgroups G2 to G5 and G7 (51 to 65/67 chromosomes) were associated with low-risk, G7 (with </=50 chromosomes) and G9 were intermediate-risk, whereas G1, G6, and G8 were defined as high-risk subgroups. In adult BCP ALL, G1, G2, G6, and G8 were associated with high risk, while G4, G5, and G7 had relatively favorable outcomes. This large-scale transcriptome sequence analysis of BCP ALL revealed distinct molecular subgroups that reflect discrete pathways of BCP ALL, informing disease classification and prognostic stratification. The combined results strongly advocate that RNA sequencing be introduced into the clinical diagnostic workup of BCP ALL.","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.', ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200127 Shanghai, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200025 Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 1138654 Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 4668550 Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, 5778502 Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, 8528521 Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Paediatrics, KK Women's & Children's Hospital, 229899 Singapore."", 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, University of Malaya Medical Centre, 59100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200127 Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 6068501 Kyoto, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Nagoya Medical Center, National Hospital Organization, 4600001 Nagoya, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, 1040045 Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Region Skane, Lund 22185, Sweden.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105."", 'Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 119228 Singapore.', 'Department of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 4618673 Nagoya, Japan.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200025 Shanghai, China;

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"PURPOSE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) pathophysiology is characterized by a complex crosstalk of tumor cells with the microenvironment. In this regard, NF-kappaB signaling is considered as important signaling axis, with a variety of key molecules aberrantly expressed or genetically altered in patients with CLL. One of these molecules is BIRC3 (cIAP2), a central regulator of noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling that serves as pathway brake in the absence of microenvironmental signals. However, the contribution of BIRC3 expression to CLL progression and potential therapeutic implications is unknown.Experimental Design: We analyzed the role of BIRC3 mRNA expression in primary CLL samples in correlation to clinical datasets and used ex vivo assays to investigate functional consequences on the level of NF-kappaB signaling and downstream target gene regulation. For proof-of-principle experiments, we used genetically modified cell lines. RESULTS: We demonstrate that patients with CLL with low BIRC3 expression experience a more rapid disease progression, which coincides with an enhanced activation of canonical NF-kappaB target genes evidenced by an increased p65/Rel-B nuclear translocation ratio. As a consequence of enhanced canonical NF-kappaB target gene activation, both anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members were upregulated in BIRC3(low) primary CLL cells, which was associated with higher sensitivity to venetoclax treatment in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Here we show the impact of BIRC3 expression in CLL disease progression in the absence of BIRC3 mutations and show altered canonical NF-kappaB target gene activation with therapeutic implications.","['Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria. a.egle@salk.at.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (SCRI-LIMCR), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0648-4416'],20181128,,,"['I 2795/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'I 3282/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']",,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these surface markers are proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion or cell-matrix adhesion, and they may play a role in the relapse of leukemia, similar to metastasis in carcinomas. The most important are epithelial cadherin, neural cadherin, epithelial cell-adhesion molecule, and CD44, which can be cleaved and released, and their soluble forms were found increased in serum levels of cancer patients, being implicated, in some cases, with progression, metastases, and relapse. In this review, we highlighted the role of these four adhesion molecules in carcinomas and hematological malignancies, mainly leukemia, and discuss if the serum levels of soluble forms can be correlated with the surface protein status on the leukemic cells. Accession of the soluble forms looks attractive, but their use as markers in cancer must be studied in association with other parameters, as there are significant changes in levels in other pathological conditions besides cancer. Studies correlating the levels of the forms with the status of the membrane-bound proteins in leukemic (stem) cells and correlating those parameters with relapse in leukemia may afford important knowledge and applicability of those serum markers in clinical practice. For instance, the expression of the membrane-bound forms of these adhesion proteins may have promising clinical use in leukemia and other hematological malignancies.","['1 Laboratory of Tumor Biomarkers and Osteoimmunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil.', '1 Laboratory of Tumor Biomarkers and Osteoimmunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil.', '2 Nucleus of Cancer Prevention and Research, Cancer Hospital, Federal University of Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil.', '1 Laboratory of Tumor Biomarkers and Osteoimmunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil.', '1 Laboratory of Tumor Biomarkers and Osteoimmunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9694-7888', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5807-4286']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the roles of CD56, CD11b and Smac/DIABLO gene expression levels as prognostic markers of the clinical outcome, response to chemotherapy and survival of AML patients. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 60 naive-AML patients who received induction therapy with mitoxantrone and cytarabine combined with a high dose of cytarabine. The CD56,CD11b and Smac/DIABLO expression levels were assessed using flow cytometry at diagnosis and were analysed for correlation with the possible associated risk factors, response to chemotherapy, and median duration of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: The overall results revealed that AML patients who exhibited positive expression for CD56 and CD11b had short median durations of DFS and OS.(P = 0.019, 0.006, 0.029 and 0.024, respectively). Additionally, low Smac/DIABLO expression had a negative impact on treatment outcome in terms of CR rate (p=0.012) and reduced DFS (p=0.000) and OS(p=0.000) values. Conclusions: CD56 and CD11b positivity and low Smac/DIABLO expression are important predictive factors for the occurrence of chemoresistance, in addition to other risk factors, among AML patients.","['Department of Medical Oncology and Haematological Malignancies, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Egypt.

Methods: Rats were distributed into 4 groups; negative control, HCC, gallic acid (GA), and GA-NC. Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), endoglin (ENG), heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70), pro-caspase 3, lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) and beta-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were assayed by ELISA. The pharmacokinetic parameters for GA or GA-NC were determined by means of non-compartmental approach based on the serum- concentration profiles of free GA and GA-NC after oral administration. Also, histological procedures were used for examination of liver tissue sections. Results: Anaplastic changes in liver tissues were observed in untreated HCC group, as well as a significant increase in the serum AFP level. In addition, significant elevation in the serum ENG level as an angiogenic marker and the serum levels of the apoptotic mediators; HSP-70, Bcl-2 and pro-caspase 3 beside significant amplification in the serum inflammatory modulator, LCN-2 were recorded. Treatment with free GA or GA-NC markedly recovered the anaplastic changes in the rat liver tissues. In addition, they restored serum levels of AFP, ENG, HSP-70, Bcl-2, pro-caspase-3, and LCN-2. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that GA-NC displayed a characteristic sustained release profile with 4-fold increase in bioavailability in normal and HCC-induced rats. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that encapsulation of GA into PLGA-CS-PEG enhances its oral bioavailability and anti-cancer activity. GA-NC may be a new therapeutic candidate for the mitigation of hepatocarcinogenesis.","['Department of Hormones, Medical Research Division, National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza, Egypt.

Methods: We measured LAIR-1 expression in paediatric ALL patients (n-42) and appropriate controls by flow cytometry. Median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) were calculated and correlated with demographic and clinical variables and early treatment outcome parameters. Results: The ALL cohort had an age range of 1 - 11 y and a M:F ratio of 2.5:1. 64% had WBC counts <50 x 109/L and 15 (36%) >50 x 109/L, 52% being standard risk and 48% high risk. There were 6 cases of T-ALL and 36 of B-ALL. AML1-TEL, E2A-PBX, BCR-ABL and MLL-AF4 transcripts were noted in 3, 6, 2 and 1 patient, respectively. Day 8 ABC was <1,000 in 31 and >1,000 in 8 cases, while 30 had low and 7 high MRD (both >0.01) at day 35 of treatment. The median MFI for LAIR-1 expression in control cases was 8.2 (range 7.76-11.69) and in ALL cases 4.02 (range 0.56 to 11.87), with 74% (n-31) of ALL cases showing reduced LAIR-1 expression. However, no significant correlations were found between standard ALL risk factors and LAIR-1 expression. Out of 42 patients, 4 died during induction treatment and one exited therapy, 60% (n-3/5) of these featuring low expression of LAIR-1. Also ALL patients with low LAIR-1 expression had t (12;21), t (1;19) and t (4;11) translocations in 2, 4 and 1 samples, respectively, but none had t (9;22). Of those with high LAIR-1 expression, 2 had t (9;22) (MFIs-14.43 and 11.87). Conclusions: This pilot study of LAIR-1expression in ALL suggests low expression of the inhibitory molecule in leukemic cells.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is still a great obstacle of breast cancer chemotherapy. We have previously shown that multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) is associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The lung resistance-related protein (LRP) is identified as a prognostic marker and response to treatment factor which has been studied mainly in hematological malignancy and leukemia. In this study, we aimed to analyze LRP expression and possible correlation between the expression level of this gene with MRP1 as a candidate marker for chemotherapy resistance. Materials and Methods: We collected 54 breast tumors and adjacent normal tissues from Iranian breast cancer patients and Real time RT-PCR was employed to measure the gene expression level in our samples. Results: MRP1 and LRP expression level were significantly lower in tumor tissues of the patients responding to chemotherapy compared to non-responding patients. No relation between the expression level of either of these genes and clinicopathology markers was found. Conclusion: Our results suggest that LRP gene expression is correlated to MRP1 in human breast cancer cells and may affect the clinical response to treatment.","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Institute of Medical Biotechnology, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.

Polyphemusin III has the amino acid sequence RRGCFRVCYRGFCFQRCR and is homologous to other beta-hairpin peptides from the horseshoe crab. Antimicrobial activity of the peptide was evaluated and MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values were determined. IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values measured toward human cells revealed that polyphemusin III showed a potent cytotoxic activity at concentrations of <10 muM. Polyphemusin III caused fast permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane of human leukemia cells HL-60, which was measured with trypan blue exclusion assay and lactate dehydrogenase-release assay. Flow cytometry experiments for annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide double staining revealed that the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, did not abrogate disruption of the plasma membrane by polyphemusin III. Our data suggest that polyphemusin III disrupts the plasma membrane integrity and induces cell death that is apparently not related to apoptosis. In comparison to known polyphemusins and tachyplesins, polyphemusin III demonstrates a similar or lower antimicrobial effect, but significantly higher cytotoxicity against human cancer and transformed cells in vitro.","['M.M.

Somatic mutations in blood progenitors can provide insight into the rate and processes underlying this accumulation, as well as the developmental lineage tree and stem cell division numbers. Here, we catalog mutations in the genomes of human-bone-marrow-derived and umbilical-cord-blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We find that mutations accumulate gradually during life with approximately 14 base substitutions per year. The majority of mutations were acquired after birth and could be explained by the constant activity of various endogenous mutagenic processes, which also explains the mutation load in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using these mutations, we construct a developmental lineage tree of human hematopoiesis, revealing a polyclonal architecture and providing evidence that developmental clones exhibit multipotency. Our approach highlights features of human native hematopoiesis and its implications for leukemogenesis.","[""Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Genetics, UMC Utrecht, 3584 Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'IBBTEC, CSIC-University of Cantabria, 39011 Santander, Spain.', ""Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

The 5-year cumulative incidence of complete remission after Chemo-DLI was 81.0% (95% CI, 73.3% to 88.7%) and 84.6% (95% CI, 74.5% to 94.7%) in the moderate and severe cGVHD groups, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of the mild cGVHD group at 40.9% (95% CI, 29.3% to 52.5%) and non-cGVHD group at 29.2% (95% CI 23.1% to 35.3%). The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was comparable between patients with and without cGVHD. The 5-year probabilities of progression-free survival after Chemo-DLI were 42.9% (95% CI, 26.2% to 70.2%) and 34.6% (95% CI, 15.3% to 78.2%) in the moderate and severe cGVHD groups, respectively, which were both significantly higher than those of the mild cGVHD group at 9.1% (95% CI, 2.4% to 34.1%) and non-cGVHD group at 8.3% (95% CI 3.3% to 21.3%). The 5-year probabilities of overall survival after Chemo-DLI were 56.7% (95% CI, 38.9% to 82.7%) and 43.1% (95% CI, 22.1% to 84.0%) in the moderate and severe cGVHD groups, respectively, which were both significantly higher than those of the mild cGVHD group at 9.1% (95% CI 1.8% to 47.1%) and non-cGVHD group at 14.9% (95% CI, 7.3% to 30.2%). Our observations highlight the close relationship between cGVHD and immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in patients with relapse receiving Chemo-DLI; however, mild cGVHD may not be associated with a sufficiently strong GVL effect to induce remission and improve survival.","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.

Selenoprotein S (SelS) participates in the protection of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells from oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced injury. However, whether SelS can protect vascular endothelium from high glucose (HG)-induced apoptosis and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study preliminarily analyzed aortic endothelial apoptosis and SelS expression in diabetic rats in vivo and the effects of HG on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) apoptosis and SelS expression in vitro. Subsequently, SelS expression was up- or downregulated in HUVECs using the pcDNA3.1-SelS recombinant plasmid and SelS-specific small interfering RNAs, and the effects of high/low SelS expression on HG-induced HUVEC apoptosis and a possible molecular mechanism were analyzed. As expected, HG induced vascular endothelial apoptosis and upregulated endothelial SelS expression in vivo and in vitro. SelS overexpression in HUVECs suppressed HG-induced increase in apoptosis and cleaved caspase3 level, accompanied by reduced protein kinase CbetaII (PKCbetaII), c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) phosphorylation. In contrast, inhibiting SelS expression in HUVECs further aggravated HG-induced increase in apoptosis and cleaved caspase3 level, which was accompanied by increased PKCbetaII, JNK, and Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Pretreatment with PKC activators blocked the protective effects of SelS and increased the apoptosis and cleaved caspase3 level in HUVECs. In summary, SelS protects vascular endothelium from HG-induced apoptosis, and this was achieved through the inhibition of PKCbetaII/JNK/Bcl-2 pathway to eventually inhibit caspase3 activation. SelS may be a promising target for the prevention and treatment of diabetic macrovascular complications.","['Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of General Practice, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9042-6969'],20181128,,,"['30970841/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81570727/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 14.,"In recent years, dermatologic manifestations in oncohematologic patients have become more common. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence and heterogeneity of skin manifestations in patients followed at our Hematology Department. This observational monocentrical study was conducted on 60 patients. We divided the observed conditions in exanthematous, purpuric, vesicular-bullous, papulonodular, urticarial, and eczematous manifestations. Moreover, all lesions were classified according to pathogenesis, in (a) specific skin manifestations, caused by neoplastic skin infiltration; (b) immune-mediated manifestations, based on immunological mechanisms; and (c) skin lesions due to immunodeficiency. Altogether, 73 clinical manifestations were reported. Specific manifestations (a) were detected in 15.1% of the cases, mainly with papulonodular appearance. Immune-mediated manifestations (b) were found in 37 cases (50.7%), particularly with eczematous or exanthematous appearance, and leukemia was the malignancy most frequently reported in these patients. Eventually, lesions due to immunosuppression (c) were reported in 34.2% of the cases. They were represented by infections and cutaneous malignancies, and usually manifested with papulonodular lesions. Skin lesions in oncohematologic patients are a common event. A multidisciplinary approach based on the collaboration between the hematologist and the dermatologist is crucial to achieve a proper diagnosis, and correctly manage these manifestations.","['Di.S.Sal.

Examination of AML patients treated with azacitidine (AZA) and vorinostat (VOR) in a Phase II trial, demonstrated an increase in the expression of Cancer-Testis Antigens (MAGE, RAGE, LAGE, SSX2 and TRAG3) on blasts and that these can be recognised by circulating antigen-specific T cells. Although the T cells have the potential to be activated by these unmasked antigens, the low arginine microenvironment created by AML blast Arginase II activity acts a metabolic brake leading to T cell exhaustion. T cells exhibit impaired proliferation, reduced IFN-gamma release and PD-1 up-regulation in response to antigen stimulation under low arginine conditions. Inhibition of arginine metabolism enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of anti-NY-ESO T cells against AZA/VOR treated AML blasts, and can boost anti-CD33 Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell cytotoxicity. Therefore, measurement of plasma arginine concentrations in combination with therapeutic targeting of arginase activity in AML blasts could be a key adjunct to immunotherapy.","['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medicine, Veterinary Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Bio-cancer Treatment International Ltd, Hong Kong.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medicine, Veterinary Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3342-0047'],20190111,,,,,PMC6767531,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Nov 28.,"The role of tumour microenvironment in neoplasm initiation and malignant evolution has been increasingly recognized. However, the bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell (BMMSC) contribution to disease progression remains poorly explored. We previously reported that the expression of serine protease inhibitor kunitz-type2 (SPINT2/HAI-2), an inhibitor of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activation, is significantly lower in BMMSC from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients compared to healthy donors (HD). Thus, to investigate whether this loss of expression was due to SPINT2/HAI-2 methylation, BMMSC from MDS and de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (de novo AML) patients were treated with 5-Azacitidine (Aza), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. In MDS- and de novo AML-BMMSC, Aza treatment resulted in a pronounced SPINT2/HAI-2 levels up-regulation. Moreover, Aza treatment of HD-BMMSC did not improve SPINT2/HAI-2 levels. To understand the role of SPINT2/HAI-2 down-regulation in BMMSC physiology, SPINT2/HAI-2 expression was inhibited by lentivirus. SPINT2 underexpression resulted in an increased production of HGF by HS-5 stromal cells and improved survival of CD34(+) de novo AML cells. We also observed an increased adhesion of de novo AML hematopoietic cells to SPINT2/HAI-2 silenced cells. Interestingly, BMMSC isolated from MDS and de novo AML patients had increased expression of the integrins CD49b, CD49d, and CD49e. Thus, SPINT2/HAI-2 may contribute to functional and morphological abnormalities of the microenvironment niche and to stem/progenitor cancer cell progression. Hence, down-regulation in SPINT2/HAI-2 gene expression, due to methylation in MDS-BMMSC and de novo AML-BMMSC, provides novel insights into the pathogenic role of the leukemic bone marrow microenvironment.","['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro Infantil de Investigacoes Hematologicas Dr. Domingos A.

Cross-entity comparisons of the MZ Ig sequence dataset with a large dataset of Ig sequences (MZ-related or not; n = 65 837) revealed four major clusters of cases sharing homologous ('public') heavy variable complementarity-determining region 3. These clusters included rearrangements from SMZL, ENMZL (gastric, salivary gland, ocular adnexa), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but also rheumatoid factors and non-malignant splenic MZ cells. In conclusion, different MZ lymphomas display biased immunogenetic signatures indicating distinct antigen exposure histories. The existence of rare public stereotypes raises the intriguing possibility that common, pathogen-triggered, immune-mediated mechanisms may result in diverse B lymphoproliferations due to targeting versatile progenitor B cells and/or operating in particular microenvironments.

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to regulate the progression of numerous types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous studies demonstrated that miR12715p functions as a tumor suppressor; however, the roles of miR12715p in AML remain unknown. In the present study, miR12715p was significantly downregulated in AML tissues compared with normal tissues by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Furthermore, the expression levels of miR12715p in patients with AML may function as a prognostic marker. In addition, overexpression of miR12715p significantly suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis of AML cells by Cell Counting kit8 and fluorescence activated cell sorter assays; miR12715p downregulation exhibited opposing effects. Additionally, transcription factor ZIC2 may be a direct target of miR12715p in AML cells, which was demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay and RNA pulldown assay. Overexpression of miR12715p significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of ZIC2 in AML193 and OCIAML2 cells by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blotting. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between miR12715p and ZIC2 expression in AML samples was observed. In summary, ZIC2 was upregulated in AML tissues, and restoration of ZIC2 expression was able to promote the proliferation and reduce the apoptosis of AML cells transfected with miR12715p mimics. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR12715p inhibited the progression of AML by targeting ZIC2.","['Department of Blood Transfusion, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Ruian, Zhejiang 325200, P.R.

In this in vitro study, we report that the concentration of etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison widely used in clinics, determines both the kinetics of cell death, and the type of apoptosis induced. We observed that on a set of myeloid leukemia cell lines, etoposide at high (50 uM) dose promoted a rapid caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, whereas at low (0.5 uM) dose, it induced morphological and functional granulocytic differentiation and caspase-2-dependent, but caspase-3-independent, cell death, displaying features consistent with apoptosis. Both differentiation and caspase-2- (but not 3)-mediated apoptosis were contrasted by caffeine, a well-known inhibitor of the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), which maintained cell viability and cycling, indicating that the effects of low etoposide dose are not the immediate consequence of damage, but the result of a signaling pathway. DDR may be thus the mediator responsible for translating a mere dosage-effect into different signal transduction pathways, highlighting a strategic action in regulating timing and mode of cell death according to the severity of induced damage. The evidence of different molecular pathways induced by high vs. low drug doses may possibly contribute to explain the different effects of cytotoxic vs. metronomic therapy, the latter achieving durable clinical responses by treating cancer patients with stable, low doses of otherwise canonical cytotoxic drugs; intriguingly caspase-3, a major promoter of wounded tissue regeneration, is also a key factor of post-therapy cancer repopulation. All this suggests that cancer control in response to cytotoxic drugs arises from complex reprogramming mechanisms in tumor tissue, recently described as anakoinosis.","['Department of Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Diagnostica Medica and Villa dei Platani, Avellino, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"", Rome, Italy.']",,20181113,,,,,PMC6243040,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a very unusual case of a patient (female, 70 years old) who was admitted to the hospital in 2016 because of skin lesions on the face, the trunk of the body and the extremities. She had a history of breast cancer in the year 2004 (pT1b, pN0, cM0, L0, V0, R0) which had been resected and treated with adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracile) as well as psoriasis treated with methotrexate and cyclosporine. Because of mild cytopenia a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy was performed showing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with multilineage dysplasia. Cytogenetic review revealed a complex aberrant karyotype denoting adverse outcome. Simultaneously, a skin biopsy could confirm leukemic skin infiltration. Consequently, a therapy with azacitidine was started. After the first cycle the patient developed severe pancytopenia with a percentage of 13% peripheral blasts (previously 0-2%) as well as fever without evidence for infection which was interpreted as progressive disease. Therefore, the therapeutic regimen was changed to a biomodulatory therapy consisting of low-dose azacitidine 75 mg/day (given sc d1-7 of 28), pioglitazone 45 mg/day per os, and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 45 mg/m2/day per os. After cycle 1 of this combined biomodulatory therapy the patient showed hematologic recovery; besides a mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl) she developed a normal blood count. Moreover, the cutaneous leukemic infiltrates which had been unaffected by the azacitidine ameliorated tremendously after 2 cycles resulting in a complete remission of the skin lesions after cycle 6. In conclusion, we report a very unusual case with cutaneous infiltrates being the first clinical manifestation of hematologic disease, preceding the development of acute myeloid leukemia. While azacitidine alone was ineffective, a combined biomodulatory approach resulted in a complete remission of the cutaneous manifestation.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",,20181113,,,,,PMC6243099,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"Ribosomopathies are congenital disorders caused by mutations in ribosomal proteins (RP) or assembly factors and are characterized by cellular hypoproliferation at an early stage. Paradoxically, many of these disorders have an elevated risk to progress to hyperproliferative cancer at a later stage. In addition, somatic RP mutations have recently been identified in various cancer types, for example, the recurrent RPL10-R98S mutation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and RPS15 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously showed that RPL10-R98S promotes expression of oncogenes, but also induces a proliferative defect due to elevated oxidative stress. In this study, we demonstrate that this proliferation defect is eventually rescued by RPL10-R98S mouse lymphoid cells that acquire 5-fold more secondary mutations than RPL10-WT cells. The presence of RPL10-R98S and other RP mutations also correlated with a higher mutational load in patients with T-ALL, with an enrichment in NOTCH1-activating lesions. RPL10-R98S-associated cellular oxidative stress promoted DNA damage and impaired cell growth. Expression of NOTCH1 eliminated these phenotypes in RPL10-R98S cells, in part via downregulation of PKC-theta, with no effect on RPL10-WT cells. Patients with RP-mutant CLL also demonstrated a higher mutational burden, enriched for mutations that may diminish oxidative stress. We propose that oxidative stress due to ribosome dysfunction causes hypoproliferation and cellular insufficiency in ribosomopathies and RP-mutant cancer. This drives surviving cells, potentiated by genomic instability, to acquire rescuing mutations, which ultimately promote transition to hyperproliferation. SIGNIFICANCE: Ribosomal lesions cause oxidative stress and increase mutagenesis, promoting acquisition of rescuing mutations that stimulate proliferation.","['Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium. kim.dekeersmaecker@kuleuven.be.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8414-8907', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2402-9698', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7420-9531']",20181127,,,"['334946/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'R01 GM117177/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL119439/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7116100,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['EMS94966'],,,,,,,,,

Clonal expansion driven by leukemia-associated somatic mutations, such as DNMT3A, ASXL1, or TET2, is best characterized, but oligoclonality can also emerge without recognized leukemia-driver mutations, perhaps as a result of stochastic neutral drift. Murine models provide compelling evidence that a major mechanism of increased cardiovascular mortality in the context of clonal hematopoiesis is accelerated atherogenesis driven by inflammasome-mediated endothelial injury, resulting from proinflammatory interactions between endothelium and macrophages derived from circulating clonal monocytes. Altered inflammation likely influences other biological processes as well. The rate of development of overt neoplasia in patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), as currently defined, is 0.5% to 1% per year. Contributing factors to clonal progression other than acquisition of secondary mutations in hematopoietic cells (ie, stronger leukemia drivers) are incompletely understood. Disordered endogenous immunity in the context of increased proliferative pressure, short telomeres leading to chromosomal instability, an unhealthy marrow microenvironment that favors expansion of clonal stem cells and acquisition of new mutations while failing to support healthy hematopoiesis, and aging-associated changes in hematopoietic stem cells, including altered DNA damage response, an altered transcriptional program, and consequences of epigenetic alterations, are all potential contributors to clonal progression. Clinical management of patients with CHIP includes monitoring for hematological changes and reduction of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors; eventually, it will also likely include anti-inflammatory therapies and targeted approaches to prune emergent dangerous clones.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",,,,,,,PMC6258914,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this comes at the cost of toxicities: medical as well as financial. We highlight some of the unique toxicities associated with the novel agents to apprise our readers about what to expect, how to recognize them, and how to manage these toxicities. One of the toxicities seen with inotuzumab, a CD22 antibody drug conjugate, is sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, which can be fatal in >80% of patients if associated with multiorgan failure. Blinatumomab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD19, is associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, both of which require prompt recognition and management primarily with corticosteroids. CRS and neurotoxicity are more common and more severe with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T). The fact that CAR-T cannot be discontinued on demand adds a layer of complexity to the management of related toxicities of this therapy. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor blocker, is used to treat severe CRS from CAR-T, whereas corticosteroids remain the mainstay for neurotoxicity management. Although effective, these drugs carry a high price tag, and we review the available data on cost-effectiveness of these agents, keeping in mind that median follow-up on most of these studies is limited and that long-term data on durability of response remain to be seen.","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",,,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6258912,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, prior vaccines have not reliably induced effective antileukemic immunity, in part because AML blasts have immune inhibitory effects and lack expression of the critical costimulatory molecule CD80. To enhance induction of leukemia-specific cytolytic activity, 32Dp210 murine AML cells were engineered to express either CD80 alone, or the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) with its receptor alpha (IL-15Ralpha), or heterodimeric IL-15/IL-15Ralpha together with CD80 and tested as irradiated cell vaccines. IL-15 is a gammac-chain cytokine, with unique properties suited to stimulating antitumor immunity, including stimulation of both natural killer and CD8(+) memory T cells. Coexpression of IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha markedly increases IL-15 stability and secretion. Non-tumor-bearing mice vaccinated with irradiated 32Dp210-IL-15/IL-15Ralpha/CD80 and challenged with 32Dp210 leukemia had greater survival than did mice treated with 32Dp210-CD80 or 32Dp210-IL-15/IL-15Ralpha vaccines, whereas no unvaccinated mice inoculated with leukemia survived. In mice with established leukemia, treatment with 32Dp210-IL-15/IL-15Ralpha/CD80 vaccination stimulated unprecedented antileukemic immunity enabling 80% survival, an effect that was abrogated by anti-CD8 antibody-mediated depletion in vivo. Because, clinically, AML vaccines are administered as postremission therapy, we established a novel model in which mice with high leukemic burdens were treated with cytotoxic therapy to induce remission (<5% marrow blasts). Postremission vaccination with 32Dp210-IL-15/IL-15Ralpha/CD80 achieved 50% overall survival in these mice, whereas all unvaccinated mice achieving remission subsequently relapsed. These studies demonstrate that combined expression of IL-15/IL-15Ralpha and CD80 by syngeneic AML vaccines stimulates effective and long-lasting antileukemic immunity.","['Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA.', 'Human Retrovirus Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD; and.', 'Human Retrovirus Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD; and.', ""Department of Haematological Medicine, Rayne Institute, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA.']",,,,,['R21 CA177284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6258921,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the study, the dose rate N of continuous irradiation is varied from 3x10(-6) to 0.576Sv/day and the dose D is varied from zero to 2.2Sv. In the considered range of doses D, the developed model reproduces the linear dependence of ERR on D for the low dose rates N. For higher N, the dependence of ERR on D remains linear for low doses D and becomes nonlinear for higher D, that agrees with empirical observations. In turn, for the considered values of D, the developed model reproduces the practical independence of the ratio ERR/D on N at low N, the inverse dependence of the ratio ERR/D on N at higher N, and the direct dependence of the ratio ERR/D on N at more high N, that also conforms to empirical observations. Additionally, the modeling values of ERR obtained for the scenarios of continuous irradiation corresponding to those for the nuclear industry workers, Chernobyl cleanup workers, and patients treated with radiotherapy, practically, coincide with the respective empirical data. All these modeling findings, along with those obtained in our previous works, demonstrate the predictive power of the developed model and its capability of estimating, on quantitative level, the excess relative risk for non-CLL leukemia among humans exposed to continuous irradiation in wide ranges of doses and dose rates.","['Department of Health Physics and Diagnostic Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, USA.

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"Introduction: Epigenetic dysregulation drives or supports numerous human cancers. The chromatin landscape in cancer cells is often marked by abnormal histone post-translational modification (PTM) patterns and by aberrant assembly and recruitment of protein complexes to specific genomic loci. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses can support the discovery and characterization of both phenomena. Areas covered: We broadly divide this literature into two parts: 'modification-centric' analyses that link histone PTMs to cancer biology; and 'complex-centric' analyses that examine protein-protein interactions that occur de novo as a result of oncogenic mutations. We also discuss proteomic studies of oncohistones. We highlight relevant examples, discuss limitations, and speculate about forthcoming innovations regarding each application. Expert commentary: 'Modification-centric' analyses have been used to further understanding of cancer's histone code and to identify associated therapeutic vulnerabilities. 'Complex-centric' analyses have likewise revealed insights into mechanisms of oncogenesis and suggested potential therapeutic targets, particularly in MLL-associated leukemia. Proteomic experiments have also supported some of the pioneering studies of oncohistone-mediated tumorigenesis. Additional applications of proteomics that may benefit cancer epigenetics research include middle-down and top-down histone PTM analysis, chromatin reader profiling, and genomic locus-specific protein identification. In the coming years, proteomic approaches will remain powerful ways to interrogate the biology of cancer.","['a Epigenetics Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Epigenetics Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6941-0604'],20181127,,,"['P01 CA196539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM110174/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001880/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008275/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6536358,,,,,['NIHMS1520148'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Accelerated atherosclerosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is preceded by endothelial dysfunction (ED), which exhibits a proinflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype and enhanced oxidative stress. In this study, the effect of several compounds with anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant properties on uremia-induced endothelial dysfunction has been evaluated in an in vitro model. METHODS: Endothelial cells (ECs) were exposed to sera from uremic patients in the absence and presence of the flavonoids apigenin, genistein and quercetin, the antioxidant enzyme mimetics (AEM) ebselen (glutathione peroxidase mimetic), EUK-134 and EUK-118 (both superoxide dismutase mimetics), and the pharmacological drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC). We explored changes in the expression of adhesion receptors on the cell surface, by immunofluorescence, the production of radical oxygen species (ROS), by fluorescence detection, and the activation of signaling proteins related to inflammation, by both a phosphospecific antibody cell-based ELISA and immunoblotting techniques. RESULTS: Uremic media induced a significantly increased expression of ICAM-1, overproduction of radical oxygen species (ROS) and activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and Nuclear Factor kB (NFkB) in ECs. Quercetin, the AEM and NAC showed a significant inhibitory effect on both ICAM-1 expression and ROS generation (p<0.05). All the compounds reduced p38MAPK activation, but only the AEM, especially ebselen, and NAC, both potentiating the glutathione peroxidase pathway, also inhibited NFkB activation. These two compounds were capable of increasing endothelial glutathione levels, especially in response to uremia. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the potentiation of the antioxidant pathways can be an effective strategy to improve endothelial dysfunction in uremia and a potential target to reduce the cardiovascular risk in this population.","['Nephrology Department, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Department, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Department, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut Hemodialisis Barcelona, Barcelona, Spainacases@clinic.ub.es.', ""Nephrology Department, Bellvitge Hospital, IDIBELL, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spainacases@clinic.ub.es."", 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIBArrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Department, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Department, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Department, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.']",,20181127,,['Cell Physiol Biochem. 2019;52(5):1251-1252.

Epub 2018 Nov 24.,"This long-term follow-up study evaluated the effects of corticosteroid prophylaxis on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) based on a controlled open-label randomized trial in which 228 allotransplant recipients were categorized as low risk (n=83, group A) or high risk; patients at high risk were randomly assigned to receive (n=72, group B) or not receive (n=73, group C) low-dose methylprednisolone prophylaxis. The cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, leukemia-free survival, overall survival, and GRFS were 60%, 19%, 16%, 68%, 73%, and 46%, respectively, in all cases. Compared with the patients in group C, the cases in group B experienced a lower cumulative incidence of moderate to severe chronic GVHD (42% versus 20%; P = .010), herpes zoster infection (28% versus 12%; P = .010), pulmonary infections (42% versus 21%; P = .040), and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH; 16% versus 6%; P = .045) as well as better GRFS (59% versus 33%; P = .017). Factors associated with GRFS included total dose of corticosteroid used in the first 100days after transplantation (hazard ratio, 1.547; P=.015) and platelet recovery (hazard ratio, 1.456; P=.037). Our results suggest that low-dose glucocorticoid prophylaxis reduces GVHD and thus reduces the total dose of steroids, which might contribute to lower incidence of infections and ONFH and a superior GRFS, indicating that higher steroid doses are harmful. Reducing the total dose is of course beneficial.

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"BACKGROUND: Aneuploidy occurs in more than 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases and correlates with an adverse prognosis. METHODS: To understand the molecular bases of aneuploid acute myeloid leukemia (A-AML), this study examined the genomic profile in 42 A-AML cases and 35 euploid acute myeloid leukemia (E-AML) cases. RESULTS: A-AML was characterized by increased genomic complexity based on exonic variants (an average of 26 somatic mutations per sample vs 15 for E-AML). The integration of exome, copy number, and gene expression data revealed alterations in genes involved in DNA repair (eg, SLX4IP, RINT1, HINT1, and ATR) and the cell cycle (eg, MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM7, MCM8, MCM10, UBE2C, USP37, CK2, CK3, CK4, BUB1B, NUSAP1, and E2F) in A-AML, which was associated with a 3-gene signature defined by PLK1 and CDC20 upregulation and RAD50 downregulation and with structural or functional silencing of the p53 transcriptional program. Moreover, A-AML was enriched for alterations in the protein ubiquitination and degradation pathway (eg, increased levels of UHRF1 and UBE2C and decreased UBA3 expression), response to reactive oxygen species, energy metabolism, and biosynthetic processes, which may help in facing the unbalanced protein load. E-AML was associated with BCOR/BCORL1 mutations and HOX gene overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that aneuploidy-related and leukemia-specific alterations cooperate to tolerate an abnormal chromosome number in AML, and they point to the mitotic and protein degradation machineries as potential therapeutic targets.","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna and L. e A.

A specific cancer spectrum and distinctive needs of AYA patients require targeted studies and cancer control measures. Incidence is intermediate between that for children and for older adults, and two-thirds of the AYA cancers affect women. Cancers of the breast and cervix uteri, representing a large portion of the burden, are amenable to prevention. Survival is relatively high, but it is lower in AYA patients with certain cancers that are common in childhood or older adulthood. Tailored cancer care with centralized multidisciplinary provision improves the outcome, as demonstrated by survival of leukemia patients. Mortality is decreasing in high-income countries for the cancers that contribute to the burden most, but lack of progress is seen for some rarer subtypes, such as brain tumors and sarcomas of the bone and soft tissue. There is unacceptable lack of information on cancer burden in low-income countries in which the outcomes for AYA patients are likely dreadful. Investment is required to establish cancer registration system and appropriate cancer care delivery in these settings.","['Section of Cancer Surveillance, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the deubiquitination properties, USP1 protein can prevent proteasomal degradation of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in a cell and, consequently, contribute to its accumulation, and the progression of the disease. In this work, creating the genetic constructs, we detected the USP1 protein localization in the cell. Also, a nuclear colocalization of USP1 protein with PH domain of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in HEK293T cells was shown. The results are important for understanding the implications of the Philadelphia chromosome emergence, and the development of new methods for CML treatment, since the recent techniques are not always effective due to the emergence of numerous mutations that cause drug resistance and relapse of the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"INTRODUCTION: Nonhemopoietic neoplasms (NHNs) may be encountered during routine flow cytometry (FC) immunophenotyping. The clue of their presence mainly relies on detection of CD45-negative (CD45-) cells with altered scatter parameters. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated a monoclonal antibody combination conceived to characterize the CD45- population by FC, suspected of belonging to NHNs, when present. The panel included CD45 for leucocytes identification, CD326 (clones BerEP4 and HEA-125) to mark epithelial cells, CD33 to identify myeloid cells, CD138 to trace plasma cells and CD56 useful in the identification of neuroendocrine tumours. 7AAD vital dye was used to gate out dead cells. Results were correlated with cytomorphology and confirmed by histological data, if available. RESULTS: Among 9422 specimens submitted for routine FC investigation, 47 samples that included fine-needle aspirates, bone marrow aspirates, tissue biopsies and body fluids had a detectable CD45- population and a sufficient cell amount to be further investigated. FC revealed the presence of CD326-positive epithelial cells in 38 specimens; altered scatter parameters and variable reactivity to the other antigens tested allowed to suspect NHNs in the remaining nine samples. The presence of NHNs was confirmed in all cases by morphology. CONCLUSIONS: The current results show that when CD45- cells with altered scatter parameters were detected, cytometrists involved in leukaemia/lymphoma diagnosis may require further FC investigations to rapidly identify NHNs in different specimens, thus reducing the time of the immunohistochemical diagnostic workup to reach a final diagnosis.","[""Flow Cytometry Unit, Pathology Division, Citta' della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Flow Cytometry Unit, Pathology Division, Citta' della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Flow Cytometry Unit, Pathology Division, Citta' della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Pathology Division, Citta' della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Pathology Division, Citta' della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Pathology Division, Citta' della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Pathology Division, Citta' della Salute e della Scienza Hospital, Turin, Italy."", 'University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9605-7209'],20181127,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this prospective study we evaluated effects of such stratification, including intensification of therapy based on response assessment at day-15 and MRD at day-29 of induction to test if treatment intensification would improve outcomes. Methods: 241 patients, 1-14 years old, newly diagnosed with ALL, were recruited and stratified by risk and MRD response into three treatment Arms (A, B, or C). Arm A was modified from COG AALL0331, B from AALL0232, and C from AALL0232 and AALL0434. Assignments were according to NCI risk, phenotype, rapid vs. slow early response (SER), steroid pretreatment, MLL rearrangement (MLLR), CNS3, and testicular involvement. Patients on Arm A had treatment intensified early based on day-15 marrow results or late based on end-of-induction MRD. Results: 5-year OS, EFS, and CIR were 89.5% +/- 4.0%, 87.6% +/- 4.3%, and 7.1% +/- 3.5%. No significant difference was found by B- vs. T cell phenotype. 5-year OS, EFS, and CIR for B-cell ALL were 90.5% +/- 2.4%, 88.7% +/- 2.6%, and 6.4% +/- 2.0%. Outcomes for patients with t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1 and MLLR were significantly (p </= 0.05) worse than for other patients. MRD level at end-of-induction associated with outcomes, but association with a specific MRD value at end-of-induction varied significantly by NCI-risk group. Late treatment intensification based on end-of-induction MRD significantly improved survival outcomes for NCI-SR patients, however, patients with NCI-HR and positive MRD at end-of-induction had significantly inferior outcomes despite intensification. MRD transitions between day-15 and day-29 of induction associated with differences for OS and EFS. Conclusions: Arm switching to a more intensive protocol had mixed results. Assigning patients by end-of-induction MRD-risk alone did not reflect response kinetics of the different NCI-risk groups. Although late treatment intensification improved outcomes of NCI-SR patients with positive MRD at end-of-induction, further refinement is needed to improve outcomes of NCI-HR with SER. Integration of NCI-risk group with specific MRD value and time point allows more refined treatment stratification.Trial Registration Protocols were approved by King Abdullah International Medical Research Center and Ethics Review Committee RC08053J.","['1Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm AlQura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.0000 0000 9137 6644grid.412832.e', 'Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences and King Abdulaziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, P.O.

Despite this clinical success, FDA-approved T-cell therapies are currently limited to B-cell malignancies, and challenges remain with managing cytokine-related toxicities. We have designed a novel antibody-T-cell receptor (AbTCR) platform where we combined the Fab domain of an antibody with the gamma and delta chains of the TCR as the effector domain. We demonstrate the ability of anti-CD19-AbTCR-T cells to trigger antigen-specific cytokine production, degranulation, and killing of CD19-positive cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. By using the same anti-CD19 binding moiety on an AbTCR compared to a CAR platform, we demonstrate that AbTCR activates cytotoxic T-cell responses with a similar dose-response as CD28/CD3zeta CAR, yet does so with less cytokine release and results in T cells with a less exhausted phenotype. Moreover, in comparative studies with the clinically validated CD137 (4-1BB)-based CAR, CTL019, our anti-CD19-AbTCR shows less cytokine release and comparable tumor inhibition in a patient-derived xenograft leukemia model.","['Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', ""2Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.0000 0004 1936 8972grid.25879.31"", ""2Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.0000 0004 1936 8972grid.25879.31"", 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7663-1130'],20181120,,,['P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6242878,"['Y.X., Z.Y., L.H.H., P.Z., L.L., B.Z., S.G., J.L., J.F.M., V.W.C., H.L., and C.L.', 'are employees of and have equity ownership and/or stock options in Eureka', 'Therapeutics, Inc.

Different pathogenesis mechanisms participate in transformation, including transformation of existing potential preleukemic clones, since JAK2-mutant myeloproliferative neoplasms often transform to JAK2 wild-type acute myeloid leukemia. Case presentation: Here, we present an 80 year old man with a JAK2-V617F mutant primary myelofibrosis. After 10 months the disease transform into a Philadelphia chromosome positive acute myeloid leukemia, detecting the cytogenetic aberration; t(9;22)(q34;q22) encoding the rare BCR-ABL1 fusion gene; e6a2. The patient had treatment response to tyrosine kinases, illustrating the potential benefits of such approach in treating these patients subset. Conclusion: The case illustrates the potential of leukemic transformation to Philadelphia chromosome positive myeloid malignancies from potential existing preleukemic clones, and the awareness of such an evolution among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Tyrosine kinases have potential effect also in patients presenting without chronic myeloid leukemia and with rare BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts, and should probably be a part of the treatment approach.","['1Department of Medicine, Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0004 0639 0732grid.459576.c', '1Department of Medicine, Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0004 0639 0732grid.459576.c', '2Department of Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0000 9753 1393grid.412008.f', '3Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Northern Norway, Tromso, Norway.0000 0004 4689 5540grid.412244.5', '4Department of Medical Biochemistry, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0000 9753 1393grid.412008.f', '5Department of Pathology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0000 9753 1393grid.412008.f', '6Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.0000 0004 1936 7443grid.7914.b', '7Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0000 9753 1393grid.412008.f', '6Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.0000 0004 1936 7443grid.7914.b', '7Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0000 9753 1393grid.412008.f', '6Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.0000 0004 1936 7443grid.7914.b', '7Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.0000 0000 9753 1393grid.412008.f']",,20181121,,,,,PMC6249888,"['Sampling for bio banking was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Region III,', 'University of Bergen, Norway) and sample collected after written informed', 'consent.Written informed consent for research and publication from the patients', 'was obtained.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer', 'Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and', 'institutional affiliations.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when ALL manifests with unusual signs and the blood counts and peripheral smears are normal, it causes a diagnostic dilemma. Case Report: We report a 5-year-old boy who presented with bilateral proptosis as the initial manifestation of ALL. He presented with fever and bilateral knee pain attributed to a fall while playing. There was a history of progressive bilateral proptosis for a 3-month period not associated with any other complaints such as fever, eye pain, redness, or tearing. Thyroid function tests were normal. Blood counts acquired upon proptosis presentation were normal. When he presented to us three months later, blood counts revealed a pancytopenia but the peripheral smear showed no abnormal cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits was normal. Bone marrow aspirate flow cytometry confirmed the diagnosis of B cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists should be aware of the unusual ophthalmologic manifestations of acute leukemia, as they may precede overt leukemia and cause diagnostic dilemmas.

Methods: Between 2014 and 2016, all cornea donors that had negative screening serologic results for hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen, HB surface antibody (Ab), hepatitis C virus Ab, human immune deficiency virus Ab, human T-cell leukemia virus Ab, and syphilis, and positive serology for HB core Ab were subjected to real-time PCR with a detection limit of 400 IU/mL to identify HBV DNA. Positive results for HBV DNA were considered occult HBV infections in these donors. Results: Over the 3-year period, 122 out of 10448 cornea donors had negative screening serologic tests outside of HB core Ab. Of which, 90 cases were subjected to real-time PCR. Occult HBV was detected in 11 cases (12.2%), resulting in the rejection of the corresponding corneas. The remaining 79 cases (87.8%) had negative results for HBV DNA and the corresponding corneas were used for transplantation.

These data, which suggested a dose-response threshold for radiation-induced leukemia, were included in the first UNSCEAR report (1958). However, this evidence of a threshold was not recognized. It was obfuscated and concealed. In 2010, Zbigniew Jaworowski identified these data as evidence of radiation hormesis. A letter to the editor in 2014 and 2 articles in 2014 and 2015 presented a graph of these UNSCEAR 1958 data, which revealed a threshold at about 500 mSv. Since the blood-forming stem cells of bone marrow are more radiosensitive than most other cell types, it is reasonable to expect thresholds for inducing other types of cancer by ionizing radiation-their thresholds are likely higher than 500 mSv. A careful examination of the Wald data reveals the suprisingly low incidence of radiogenic leukemia, only 0.5% of the survivors who were in the high radiation zone. Many articles on radiation risk have been published since 2015 by other authors, but none makes reference to this evidence of a threshold, either to challenge or endorse it. In this commentary, the author addresses the comments from a colleague.","['Cuttler & Associates Inc, Vaughan, Ontario, Canada.']",,20181120,,,,,PMC6247492,"['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite considerable interest in biomarker discovery and development, improvements in the range and quality of biomarkers are still needed. The main challenge is how to integrate preclinical data to obtain a reliable biomarker that can be measured with acceptable costs in routine clinical practice. Epigenetic alterations are already being incorporated as valuable candidates in the biomarker field. Furthermore, their reversible nature offers a promising opportunity to ameliorate disease symptoms by using epigenetic-based therapy. Thus, beyond helping to understand disease biology, clinical epigenetics is being incorporated into patient management in oncology, as well as being explored for clinical applicability for other human pathologies such as neurological and infectious diseases and immune system disorders.","['Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mberdasco@idibell.cat.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6750-0400', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4490-6093']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robust metabolism is the hallmark of cancer. PPAT (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase) catalyzes the first committed step of de novo purine biosynthesis. Hence PPAT, the key regulatory spot in De novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, is an attractive and credible drug target for leukemia and other cancer therapeutics. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, detailed computational analysis has been performed for PPAT protein, the key enzyme in de novo purine biosynthesis which is inhibited by many folate derivatives, hence we aimed to investigate and gauge the inhibitory effect of antifolate derivatives; lomexterol (LTX) methotrexate (LTX), and pipretixin (PTX) with human PPAT to effectively capture and inhibit De novo purine biosynthesis pathway. METHODS: The sequence to structure computational approaches followed by molecular docking experiments was performed to gain insight into the inhibitory mode, binding orientation and binding affinities of selected antifolate derivatives against important structural features of PPAT. RESULTS: Results indicated a strong affinity of antifolate inhibitors for the conserved active site of PPAT molecule encompassing a number of hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, Vander Waals and electrostatic interactions.

SNPs in miRNAs could affect their levels or function, and affect their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic pathway target genes. Our aim was to determine the association between miRNA genetic variants targeting mucositis-related genes and mucositis-developing risk. PATIENTS & METHODS: We analyzed 160 SNPs in 179 Spanish children with B-cell precursor ALL homogeneously treated with LAL/SHOP protocols. RESULTS: We identified three SNPs in miR-4268, miR-4751 and miR-3117 associated with mucositis, diarrhea and vomiting, respectively. CONCLUSION: The effect of these SNPs on genes related to drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics could explain mucositis, diarrhea and vomiting development during ALL therapy.","['Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology & Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology & Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology & Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology & Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology & Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Donostia, San Sebastian, 20014, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'Department of Oncohematology, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, 28046, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Cruces, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Cruces, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology & Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We did a meta-analysis including 8 clinical trials to verify the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL and NHL. METHODS: We searched and investigated all relevant publications from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR). The secondary end points were the minimal residual disease (MRD) response, and the adverse effects including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and grade >/= 3 neurological events. RESULTS: Our study showed that the pooled CR rate was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.37-0.53) in ALL and 0.20 (0.12-0.27) in NHL respectively. The pooled CR rate is higher in ALL patients with BM blasts <50% than that of patients with BM blasts >/=50% (0.75 versus 0.33). A history of allo-HSCT has no effect on the CR rate. The pooled MRD response rate was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.29-0.54) in ALL. For adverse effects, the pooled occurrence rate of grade >/=3 CRS was 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.06), and the pooled occurrence rate of grade >/= 3 neurological events was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.08-0.16). DISCUSSION: Blinatumomab is effective in treating relapsed/refractory ALL and NHL. ALL patients manifested better therapeutic response than NHL patients and a reduced tumor load favored the clinical response. For adverse effects, severe CRS and neurological events did not happen very often. CONCLUSION: Blinatumomab shows valid therapeutic effects and limited adverse response in treating relapsed/refractory ALL and NHL in our meta-analysis.","['a Bone Marrow Transplantation Center , the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China.', ""b Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , People's Republic of China."", 'a Bone Marrow Transplantation Center , the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China.', ""b Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , People's Republic of China."", 'a Bone Marrow Transplantation Center , the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China.', ""b Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"BACKGROUND: Objectives were to describe bothersome fatigue in children with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) recipients and to identify factors associated with severely bothersome fatigue. METHODS: We included children ages 8-18 years treated for cancer or HSCT recipients from three groups: [1] receiving active cancer treatment and admitted to hospital for at least 3 days, [2] attending outpatient clinic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance therapy, and [3] attending outpatient clinic following treatment completion. Fatigue was measured using the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi); severely bothersome fatigue was defined as a lot or extremely bothersome fatigue (score of 3-4 on 0-4 scale). Factors associated with severely bothersome fatigue were examined using univariate and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 502 children included, 414 (82.5%) reported some degree of bothersome fatigue (scores 1-4), and 123 (24.5%) reported severely bothersome fatigue (score 3 or 4). In multiple regression analysis, factors significantly associated with severely bothersome fatigue were child age 11-14 and 15-18 years vs 8-10 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-3.77 and OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.66-5.44), and inpatients receiving cancer treatment vs outpatients who had completed therapy (OR 3.85, 95% CI 2.17-7.27). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 82.5% of children with cancer or HSCT recipients reported bothersome fatigue and 24.5% of children reported severely bothersome fatigue. Risk factors for severely bothersome fatigue were older age and inpatients receiving active cancer treatment. Future work should evaluate systematic symptom screening in clinical practice and apply interventions to reduce fatigue.","['Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital, 4480 Oak Street Room B315, Vancouver, V6H 3V4, Canada."", 'Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, 800 Commissioners Road East, London, ON, N6A 5W9, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A4, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, 401 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L1, Canada."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, 282 Washington Street, Hartford, CT, 06106, USA."", ""Division of Haematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada."", 'Division of Pediatric hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Centre, 5850/5980 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, CancerCare Manitoba, Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, Departments of Pediatrics and Child Health and Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, 675 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0V9, Canada.', 'Ontario Parents Advocating for Children with Cancer (OPACC), 99 Citation Drive, Toronto, ON, M2K 1S9, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Toronto General Hospital, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A4, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0951-3091'],20181126,,,['grant #702295/Canadian Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,"The ETS transcription factor ETV7 has been characterized as a hematopoietic oncoprotein, which requires cooperating mutations for its leukemogenic activity. Although the ETV7 gene is highly conserved among vertebrates, part of the rodents, including Mus musculus, deleted the Etv7 gene locus. Many human hematopoietic malignancies upregulate ETV7 expression but contrary to ETV7's role in oncogenesis, its physiological role in normal tissues is unknown. To determine the physiological function of ETV7 in vivo and determine its role in tumorigenesis in a mouse model, we have generated an ETV7 transgenic mouse that carries a single copy of human BAC DNA containing the ETV7 gene locus and its regulatory sequences. ETV7 heterozygous (ETV7Tg(+/WT)) mice were fertile, normal in size and born at a normal Mendelian frequency. They had a normal blood count, did not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities, and were not tumor-prone. The ETV7 expression pattern in hematopoietic cells of ETV7Tg(+/WT) mice is very similar to that in human hematopoietic cells. To examine the oncogenic potential of ETV7 in vivo, we crossed ETV7Tg(+/WT) mice with tumor-prone mouse models. ETV7 greatly accelerated loss of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog)-evoked leukemogenesis in Pten(Delta/Delta)ETV7Tg(+/WT) mice after deletion of the conditional Pten allele. Consistent with this observation, ETV7 expression enhanced the colony-forming and self-renewal activities of primary myeloid Pten(-/-) cells.

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"The poor outcomes in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) necessitate new treatments. Here we discover that EIF4E protein is elevated in most cases of infant ALL and test EIF4E targeting by the repurposed antiviral agent ribavirin, which has anticancer properties through EIF4E inhibition, as a potential treatment. We find that ribavirin treatment of actively dividing infant ALL cells on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) at clinically achievable concentrations causes robust proliferation inhibition in proportion with EIF4E expression. Further, we find that ribavirin treatment of KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-R) infant ALL cells and the KMT2A-AFF1 cell line RS4:11 inhibits EIF4E, leading to decreases in oncogenic EIF4E-regulated cell growth and survival proteins. In ribavirin-sensitive KMT2A-R infant ALL cells and RS4:11 cells, EIF4E-regulated proteins with reduced levels of expression following ribavirin treatment include MYC, MCL1, NBN, BCL2 and BIRC5. Ribavirin-treated RS4:11 cells exhibit impaired EIF4E-dependent nuclear to cytoplasmic export and/or translation of the corresponding mRNAs, as well as reduced phosphorylation of the p-AKT1, p-EIF4EBP1, p-RPS6 and p-EIF4E signaling proteins. This leads to an S-phase cell cycle arrest in RS4:11 cells corresponding to the decreased proliferation. Ribavirin causes nuclear EIF4E to re-localize to the cytoplasm in KMT2A-AFF1 infant ALL and RS4:11 cells, providing further evidence for EIF4E inhibition. Ribavirin slows increases in peripheral blasts in KMT2A-R infant ALL xenograft-bearing mice. Ribavirin cooperates with chemotherapy, particularly L-asparaginase, in reducing live KMT2A-AFF1 infant ALL cells in BMSC co-cultures. This work establishes that EIF4E is broadly elevated across infant ALL and that clinically relevant ribavirin exposures have preclinical activity and effectively inhibit EIF4E in KMT2A-R cases, suggesting promise in EIF4E targeting using ribavirin as a means of treatment.","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'NewAgeSys, Inc., Princeton Junction, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Therapy Acceleration Program, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and UNM Cancer Center, University of New Mexico Health Services, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and UNM Cancer Center, University of New Mexico Health Services, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Department of Biostatistics, Gainesville, FL, USA."", ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Children's Hospital Colorado and The University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and UNM Cancer Center, University of New Mexico Health Services, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. felix@email.chop.edu."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. felix@email.chop.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5718-4424', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1327-1662', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1799-2582']",20181126,,,"['U24CA114766/U.S. Department of Health &amp;

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"MEF2D fusion genes are newly discovered recurrent gene abnormalities that are detected in approximately 5% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. We previously demonstrated that the vector-driven expression of MEF2D fusion proteins was markedly stronger than that of wild-type MEF2D; however, the underlying mechanisms and significance of this expression have yet to be clarified. We herein showed that the strong expression of MEF2D fusion proteins was caused by the loss of the target site of miRNA due to gene translocation. We identified the target region of miRNA located in the coding region and selected miR-122 as a candidate of the responsible miRNA. Mutations at a putative binding site of miR-122 increased MEF2D expression, while the transfection of its miRNA mimic reduced the expression of wild-type MEF2D, but not MEF2D fusion proteins. We also found that MEF2D fusion proteins inhibited the transcriptional activity of PAX5, a B-cell differentiation regulator in a manner that depended on fusion-specific strong expression and an association with histone deacetylase 4, which may lead to the differentiation disorders of B cells. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying leukemia development by MEF2D fusion genes and the involvement of the deregulation of miRNA-mediated repression in cancer development.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. bun-hy@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. bun-hy@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.', 'Clinical Research Center, Nagoya Medical Center, National Hospital Organization, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ogaki Municipal Hospital, Ogaki, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular Signaling, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",,20181126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite increasing knowledge of the impact of Notch alterations on CLL biology and pathogenesis, the role of Jagged1 expressed in CLL cells remains undefined. In other cell types, it has been shown that after Notch engagement, Jagged1 not only activates Notch in signal-receiving cell, but also undergoes proteolytic activation in signal-sending cell, triggering a signaling with biological effects. We investigated whether Jagged1 expressed in CLL cells undergoes proteolytic processing and/or is able to induce Notch activation through autocrine/paracrine loops, focusing on the effect that CLL prosurvival factor IL-4 could exert on the Notch-Jagged1 system in these cells. We found that Jagged1 was constitutively processed in CLL cells and generated an intracellular fragment that translocated into the nucleus, and an extracellular fragment released into the culture supernatant. IL-4 enhanced expression of Jagged1 and its intracellular fragments, as well as Notch1/2 activation. The IL-4-induced increase in Notch1/2 activation was independent of the concomitant upregulated Jagged1 levels. Indeed, blocking Notch-Jagged1 interactions among CLL cells with Jagged1 neutralizing antibodies did not affect the expression of the Notch target Hes1. Notably, anti-Jagged1 antibodies partially prevented the IL-4-induced increase in Jagged1 processing and cell viability, suggesting that Jagged1 processing is one of the events contributing to IL-4-induced CLL cell survival. Consistent with this, Jagged1 silencing by small interfering RNA partially counteracted the capacity of IL-4 to promote CLL cell survival. Investigating the pathways whereby IL-4 promoted Notch1/2 activation in CLL cells independent of Jagged1, we found that PI3Kdelta/AKT and PKCdelta were involved in upregulating Notch1 and Notch2 proteins, respectively. Overall, this study provides new insights into the Notch-ligand system in CLL cells and suggests that targeting this system may be exploited as a novel/additional therapy approach for CLL.","['Department of Medicine, Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, Hematology Section, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Aging Sciences, University of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Transfusion Medicine and Biotechnologies, Ospedale Civile, Pescara, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Biosciences and Medical Embryology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Hematology-Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. sportolp@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy. isabella.screpanti@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Biosciences and Medical Embryology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. emanuela.rosati@unipg.it.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6549-123X'],20181126,,,,,PMC6255763,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was recently reported using in vitro prostate cancer cell lines that excess extracellular iron (EEI) diminishes anti-cancer effects of VC, promoting the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated by VC. Here we demonstrated that EEI diminished the inhibitory effect of VC on the survival of K562 human leukemic cells in vitro, by reducing the amount of H2O2 and abrogating the apoptosis pathways induced by VC. In vivo, in the presence of EEI, the growth inhibitory effect of VC on K562 cells was completely abrogated; in fact, VC enhanced K562 cell growth.

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"PURPOSE: Although myeloablative HLA haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) following pretransplant anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulated grafts (ATG+G-CSF) has been confirmed as an alternative to HSCT from HLA-matched sibling donors (MSD), the effect of haplo-HSCT on postremission treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with intermediate risk (int-risk AML) who achieved first complete remission (CR1) has not been defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective trial, among 443 consecutive patients ages 16-60 years with newly diagnosed de novo AML with int-risk cytogenetics, 147 patients with molecular int-risk AML who achieved CR1 within two courses of induction and remained in CR1 at 4 months postremission either received chemotherapy (n = 69) or underwent haplo-HSCT (n = 78). RESULTS: The 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in the haplo-HSCT group than in the chemotherapy group (74.3% vs. 47.3%; P = 0.0004 and 80.8% vs. 53.5%; P = 0.0001, respectively). In the multivariate analysis with propensity score adjustment, postremission treatment (haplo-HSCT vs. chemotherapy) was an independent risk factor affecting the LFS [HR 0.360; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.163-0.793; P = 0.011], OS (HR 0.361; 95% CI, 0.156-0.832; P = 0.017), and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR 0.161; 95% CI, 0.057-0.459; P = 0.001) either in entire cohort or stratified by minimal residual disease after the second consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloablative haplo-HSCT with ATG+G-CSF is superior to chemotherapy as a postremission treatment in patients with int-risk AML during CR1. Haplo-HSCT might be a first-line postremission therapy for int-risk AML in the absence of HLA-MSDs. Haplo-HSCT might be superior to chemotherapy as a first-line postremission treatment of intermediate-risk AML in CR1.","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Beijing, China. huangxiaojun@bjmu.edu.cn."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.']",,20181126,,,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"Retroviruses assemble and bud from infected cells in an immature form and require proteolytic maturation for infectivity. The CA (capsid) domains of the Gag polyproteins assemble a protein lattice as a truncated sphere in the immature virion. Proteolytic cleavage of Gag induces dramatic structural rearrangements; a subset of cleaved CA subsequently assembles into the mature core, whose architecture varies among retroviruses. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) is the prototypical gamma-retrovirus and serves as the basis of retroviral vectors, but the structure of the MLV CA layer is unknown. Here we have combined X-ray crystallography with cryoelectron tomography to determine the structures of immature and mature MLV CA layers within authentic viral particles. This reveals the structural changes associated with maturation, and, by comparison with HIV-1, uncovers conserved and variable features. In contrast to HIV-1, most MLV CA is used for assembly of the mature core, which adopts variable, multilayered morphologies and does not form a closed structure. Unlike in HIV-1, there is similarity between protein-protein interfaces in the immature MLV CA layer and those in the mature CA layer, and structural maturation of MLV could be achieved through domain rotations that largely maintain hexameric interactions. Nevertheless, the dramatic architectural change on maturation indicates that extensive disassembly and reassembly are required for mature core growth. The core morphology suggests that wrapping of the genome in CA sheets may be sufficient to protect the MLV ribonucleoprotein during cell entry.","['Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Structural Studies Division, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CB2 0QH Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 16610 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Science and Technology Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria.', 'Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Chemistry and Technology, 16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Chemistry and Technology, 16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany; jbriggs@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk.', 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Structural Studies Division, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CB2 0QH Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3990-6910'],20181126,,,['MC_UP_1201/16/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,PMC6294937,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively reported to be associated with hematological malignancies. The loss of miR-15a/16-1 at chromosome 13q14 is a hallmark of most of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Deletion of murine miR-15a/16-1 and miR-15b/16-2 has been demonstrated to promote B cell malignancies. Here, we evaluate the biological role of miR-15/16 clusters, crossbreeding miR-15a/16-1 and miR-15b/16-2 knockout mice. Unexpectedly, the complete deletion of both clusters promoted myeloproliferative disorders in the majority of the mice by the age of 5 months with a penetrance of 70%. These mice showed a significant enlargement of spleen and abnormal swelling of lymph nodes. Flow cytometry characterization demonstrated an expanded CD11b/Gr-1 double-positive myeloid population both in spleen and in bone marrow. The transplantation of splenocytes harvested from double-KO mice into wild-type recipient mice resulted in the development of myeloproliferative disorders, as observed in the donors. In vivo, miR-15/16 cluster deletion up-regulated the expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2, and Bcl-2. Taken together, our findings identify a driver oncogenic role for miR-15/16 cluster deletion in different leukocytic cell lineages.","['Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; carlo.croce@osumc.edu.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.']",,20181126,,,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6304943,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Invasive infections due to Trichoderma are rare and definitive diagnosis is complex to achieve because of the lack of specific diagnosis tools. We report in this work the first proven case of invasive pulmonary infection due to T. longibrachiatum in a 69-year-old white male with hematologic malignancy. The patient was successfully treated initially with voriconazole alone followed by a combination of voriconazole and caspofungine.","['UMR A PAM, Equipe Vin, Aliment, Microbiologie, Stress, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, AgroSup Dijon, 21078 Dijon cedex, France; Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'UMR A PAM, Equipe Vin, Aliment, Microbiologie, Stress, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, AgroSup Dijon, 21078 Dijon cedex, France; Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'UMR A PAM, Equipe Vin, Aliment, Microbiologie, Stress, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, AgroSup Dijon, 21078 Dijon cedex, France; Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital of Dijon, 21000 Dijon, France.

Recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular lesions identify AML patient subgroups with different survival probabilities; however, 50(-)70% of AML cases harbor either normal or risk-indeterminate karyotypes. The discovery of better biomarkers of clinical success and failure is therefore necessary to inform tailored therapeutic decisions. Harnessing the immune system against cancer with programmed death-1 (PD-1)-directed immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and other immunotherapy agents is an effective therapeutic option for several advanced malignancies. However, durable responses have been observed in only a minority of patients, highlighting the need to gain insights into the molecular features that predict response and to also develop more effective and rational combination therapies that address mechanisms of immune evasion and resistance. We will review the state of knowledge of the immune landscape of AML and identify the broad opportunity to further explore this incompletely characterized space.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether As(2)O(3) inhibited gastric cancer cell migration and angiogenesis by regulating FOXO3a expression. We found that As(2)O(3) reduced gastric cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and also inhibited cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro. Western blotting and immunofluorescence showed that As(2)O(3) downregulated the levels of p-AKT, upregulated FOXO3a expression in the nucleus, and attenuated downstream Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) expression. Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of FOXO3a significantly reversed the inhibition of As(2)O(3) and promoted cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro. Further, As(2)O(3) significantly inhibited xenograft tumor growth and angiogenesis by upregulating FOXO3a expression in vivo. However, knockdown of FOXO3a attenuated the inhibitory effect of As(2)O(3) in xenograft tumors, and increased microvessel density (MVD) and VEGF expression. Our results demonstrated that As(2)O(3) inhibited migration and angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells by enhancing FOXO3a expression.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China. zhanglinyantai@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. zhanglinyantai@126.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China. liul0131@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. zhanshining@163.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. lilychen1210@126.com.', 'Department of Physiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing211166, China. yueyuanxljm@126.com.', 'Department of Physiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing211166, China. zeater87@126.com.', 'Department of Physiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing211166, China. dujun@njmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pathology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. wyp@xzhmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China. lgu@njmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Physiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing211166, China. lgu@njmu.edu.cn.', 'Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China. lgu@njmu.edu.cn.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4241-4351', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9086-4069']",20181124,,,,,PMC6321348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that tumor initiation and development are reflected in the alteration pattern of the MNC PL component. We analyzed MNC membrane PL fractions in samples from healthy individuals and from patients with diverse types of cancers to reveal possible alterations induced by malignancy. Compared to healthy controls, the cancer samples demonstrated shifts in several membrane PL profiles. In particular, when analyzing cancer data pooled together, there were significantly higher levels in lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine fractions, and significantly lower quantities in phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid fractions in cancer samples compared to controls. The levels of sphingomyelins and diphosphatidylglycerols were relatively unaffected. Most of the differences in PLs were sustained during the analysis of individual cancers such as breast cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our findings suggest the presence of a common pattern of changes in MNC PLs during malignancy.","['Laboratory of Regulation of Cellular Activity, Institute of Molecular Biology, National Academy of Sciences, 0014 Yerevan, Armenia. hakgohar@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Regulation of Cellular Activity, Institute of Molecular Biology, National Academy of Sciences, 0014 Yerevan, Armenia. dav.hasmik@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Regulation of Cellular Activity, Institute of Molecular Biology, National Academy of Sciences, 0014 Yerevan, Armenia. chris.harutyunyan@gmail.com.', 'Center of Oncology after V.

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy (Ambra1) has been observed to be over-expressed in several cancers, but the clinical contribution of Ambra1 in breast cancer (BC) remains unknown. Hence, in this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the expression, biological role, and underlying functional mechanism of Ambra1 in BC. METHODS: Microarray and RNA-seq datasets providing Ambra1 expression data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, Oncomine, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Both standard mean deviation (SMD) and summary receiver operating characteristic methods were employed to assess Ambra1 expression in BC. We then silenced Ambra1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and performed in vitro experiments to explore the biological effects of Ambra1 on BC cells. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after Ambra1 knock-down were profiled with a microarray and overlapped with the genes correlated with Ambra1 from Multi Experiment Matrix (MEM) and genes similar to Ambra1 from Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. These overlapping genes were collected for further bioinformatics analyses to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of Ambra1 in BC. RESULTS: A total of 25 microarray and RNA-seq datasets involving 2460 breast cancer samples were included. The pooled results demonstrated that Ambra1 was markedly up-regulated in BC tissues (SMD=0.39, 95% CI=0.15-0.63; P=0.002), and the Ambra1 level was also significantly related to the progression of BC, especially metastasis status (P=0.004). In vitro experiments suggested that the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Ambra1 short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA 2450) showed a decreasing trend at 48 h compared with the control (CK) group. However, apoptosis was similar in cells transfected with Ambra1 sh-RNAs and in the CK cells. Furthermore, we performed a microarray-based comparison of genes after Ambra1 knock-down. The 828 DEGs from microarray analysis were intersected with 4266 Ambra1 co-expressed genes from MEM. Eventually, the overlapped 183 genes were found to be enriched in several well-known cancer-related pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway, chronic myeloid leukemia pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the level of Ambra1 up-regulation is clearly related to tumorigenesis and progression of BC, probably via influencing several vital pathways. However, this hypothesis needs to be validated with more in-depth experiments in the future.","['Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Chinachengang@gxmu.edu.cn.']",,20181126,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Nov 26.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteoporosis is a bone metabolic disease characterized by a systemic impairment of bone mass, which results in increased propensity of fragility fractures. A reduction in the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts contributes to the impaired bone formation observed in osteoporosis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are induced to differentiate into preosteoblasts, which are regulated by the signaling cascades initiated by the various signals, including miRNAs. miR-16-2* is a newly discovered miRNA that participates in diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, the effect of miR-16-2* on the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and the mechanism responsible are still unclear. Here we discuss the contribution of miR-16-2* to osteoporosis, osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. METHODS: The expression pattern of miR-16-2* during osteogenesis or in osteoporosis bone samples was validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts by osteogenic induced medium containing dexamethasone, ascorbate-2-phosphat, beta-glycerophosphate and vitamin-D3. The target genes of miR-16-2* were predicted by TargetScan and PicTar. The mRNA and protein levels of osteogenic key markers were detected using qRT-PCR or western blot respectively. The WNT signal activity was analyzed by TOP/FOP reporter assay. RESULTS: The expression of miR-16-2* in patient bone tissue with osteoporosis was negatively correlated with bone formation related genes. During osteoblast differentiation process, the expression of miR-16-2* was significantly decreased. Upregulation of miR-16-2* in hBMSCs impaired the osteogenic differentiation while the downregulation of miR-16-2* increased this process. Upregulation the expression of miR-16-2* could also block the WNT signal pathway by directly target WNT5A. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-16-2* could promote the activation of RUNX2, possibly by lifting the inhibitory effect of miR-16-2* on WNT pathway. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we report a novel biological role of miR-16-2* in osteogenesis through regulating WNT5A response for the first time.

Epub 2018 Nov 19.,"Imatinib (IMA) is a highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as first-line anti-cancer drug in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Due to its universal mechanism of action, IMA also has endocrine and mutagenic disrupting effects in vivo and in vitro, which raises the question of its environmental impact. However, to date, very little information is available on its environmental fate and the potential role of its transformation products (TPs) on aquatic organisms. Given the IMA resistance to hydrolysis and direct photolysis according to the literature, we sought to generate TPs through oxidative and radical conditions using the AOPs pathway. Thus, the reactivity of the cytotoxic drug IMA in water in the presence of OH and h+ was investigated for the first time in the present work. In this regard, a non-targeted screening approach was applied in order to reveal its potential TPs. The tentative structural elucidation of the detected TPs was performed by LC-HRMS(n). The proposed approach allowed detecting a total of twelve TPs, among which eleven are being described for the first time in this work. Although the structures of these TPs could not be positively confirmed due to lack of standards, their chemical formulas and product ions can be added to databases, which will allow their screening in future monitoring studies. Using the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach and rule-based software, we have shown that the detected TPs possess, like their parent molecule, comparable acute toxicity as well as mutagenic and estrogenic potential. In addition to the in silico studies, we also found that the samples obtained at different exposure times to oxidative conditions, including those where IMA is no longer detected, retained toxicity in vitro. Such results suggest further studies are needed to increase our knowledge of the impact of imatinib on the environment.","['University of Paris-Sud, Department of Pharmacy, Laboratory ""Materiaux et Sante"" EA 401, 5 rue Jean Baptiste Clement, 92296 Chatenay-Malabry, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker, Department of Pharmacy, 149 Rue de Sevres, 75015 Paris, France.

Epub 2018 Nov 17.,"Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive disease that arises from clonal expansion of malignant hematopoietic precursor cells of the bone marrow. Deletions on the long arm of chromosome 9 (del(9q)) are observed in 2% of acute myeloid leukemia patients. Our deletion analysis in a cohort of 31 del(9q) acute myeloid leukemia patients further supports the importance of a minimally deleted region composed of seven genes potentially involved in leukemogenesis: GKAP1, KIF27, C9ORF64, HNRNPK, RMI1, SLC28A3 and NTRK2. Importantly, among them HNRNPK, encoding heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K is proposed to function in leukemogenesis. We show that expression of HNRNPK and the other genes of the minimally deleted region is significantly reduced in patients with del(9q) compared with normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia. Also, two mRNAs interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, namely CDKN1A and CEBPA are significantly downregulated. While the deletion size is not correlated with outcome, associated genetic aberrations are important. Patients with an additional t(8;21) show a good prognosis. RUNX1-RUNX1T1, which emerges from the t(8;21) leads to transcriptional down-regulation of CEBPA. Acute myeloid leukemia patients with mutations in CEBPA have a good prognosis as well. Interestingly, in del(9q) patients with CEBPA mutation mRNA levels of HNRNPK and the other genes located in the minimally deleted region is restored to normal karyotype level. Our data indicate that a link between CEBPA and the genes of the minimally deleted region, among them HNRNPK contributes to leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia with del(9q).","['Department of Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.

Furthermore, EphB4 protein stimulated by EphrinB2-Fc sensitized HL60/ADM cells to Adriamycin in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, pre-incubation of HL60/ADM with 4 microg/ml EphrinB2-Fc protein for 30 min significantly sensitized tumor cell to Adriamycin treatment by reduction of tumor cell viability and induction of apoptosis (p<0.001), while there was no significant change in other groups (p>0.05).

Unfortunately though, the mode-of-action (MoA) of antitrypanosomal drugs typically remains unclear or only partially characterised. This is the case for four of five current drugs used to treat Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT); eflornithine is a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. Here, we used a panel of T. brucei cellular assays to probe the MoA of the current HAT drugs. The assays included DNA-staining followed by microscopy and quantitative image analysis, or flow cytometry; terminal dUTP nick end labelling to monitor mitochondrial (kinetoplast) DNA replication; antibody-based detection of sites of nuclear DNA damage; and fluorescent dye-staining of mitochondria or lysosomes. We found that melarsoprol inhibited mitosis; nifurtimox reduced mitochondrial protein abundance; pentamidine triggered progressive loss of kinetoplast DNA and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential; and suramin inhibited cytokinesis. Thus, current antitrypanosomal drugs perturb distinct and specific cellular compartments, structures or cell cycle phases. Further exploiting the findings, we show that putative mitogen-activated protein-kinases contribute to the melarsoprol-induced mitotic defect, reminiscent of the mitotic arrest associated signalling cascade triggered by arsenicals in mammalian cells, used to treat leukaemia. Thus, cytology-based profiling can rapidly yield novel insight into antitrypanosomal drug MoA.","['London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, United Kingdom.', 'The Centre for Immunology and Infection, University of York, Heslington, York, United Kingdom.', 'Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Anti-Infectives Research, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Anti-Infectives Research, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6159-2922', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7191-6890', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8621-4920', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5173-9284']",20181126,,,"['MR/K000500/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '093010/Z/10/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100320/Z/12/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,PMC6283605,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concrete interpretation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate specificity, whether a substance is a substrate or an inhibitor, represents an important feature of a compound's pharmaceutical profiling in drug design and development. In this work, the P-gp substrate specificity of Maldi 531.2[M+H](+), a phenol ester from Aglaia loheri Blanco leaves was investigated. This study focuses on the effect of Maldi 531.2[M+H](+) on P-gp ATPase activity, which was examined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphates (Pi) released as a result of ATP hydrolysis. To test the effects of Maldi 531.2[M+H](+) on MDR activity, an attempt to combine Maldi 531.2[M+H](+) with a potent P-gp substrate such as verapamil was performed. As a result of this combination treatment, two distinct patterns of interaction with P-gp activity were determined by a calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) assay. Depending on the concentratgion, both stimulation and inhibition of MDR activity were observed at certain drug concentrations suggesting biphasic reactions, which can be understood as cooperative stimulation and competitive inhibition, respectively. Verapamil is a strong substrate to P-gp. Substrate specificity of Maldi 531.2[M+H](+) may be less than the substrate specificity of verapamil, but it acts additively together with low concentrations of verapamil in stimulating ATPase activity.

The rate of patients with high risk for malnutrition at diagnosis was 28.4% by Screening Tool for Risk of Impaired Nutritional Status and Growth tool and 36.5% by Pediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score. Body mass index (BMI) z-scores at diagnosis showed 12.3% undernutrition (<-2 SD) and 6.8% overnutrition (>2 SD), which changed to 6.7% and 11.1% at the sixth month, respectively. Malnutrition (BMI<5th age percentile) was detected in 13.7% at diagnosis. Despite an initial deterioration noted in BMI, BMI for age percentile, and z-scores at month 1 in all malignancy subgroups (at month 3 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia), the scores improved later on. There was an increase in weight from baseline in 88.2% of patients over 6 months.

The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of AH using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, explore characteristics of AH, and define risk factors for the development of AH in childhood ALL survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 81 childhood ALL survivors (5 to 25 y of age) after a median follow-up time of 5 years. The control group consisted of 52 healthy children (5 to 17 y of age) without any known severe or chronic medical condition. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed in all patients and controls. Serum lipids were measured in all patients and controls. RESULTS: ALL survivors were more likely to have AH than controls (odds ratio, 2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.63; P=0.0315). The mean time from ALL diagnosis until diagnosis of AH was 5.1+/-2.97 years. Day-time diastolic SDS and day-time mean arterial pressure SDS were significantly higher in ALL cohort compared with the controls (-0.3+/-1.43 vs. -0.76+/-0.95; P=0.04 and 1.44+/-1.64 vs. 0.92+/-1.03; P=0.047). Childhood ALL survivors with AH were more likely to be systolic extreme dippers and reverse systolic/diastolic dippers compared with those with normal blood pressure (P<0.05). There was no association of AH with leukemia subtype, leukemia risk group, sex, central nervous system irradiation, and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AH in childhood ALL survivors may be as high as 37%. We recommend regular monitoring of blood pressure in childhood ALL survivors early in the follow-up.","['Department of Pediatrics, Hemato-Oncology, and Gastroenterology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We considered that the impact of blast percentage on survival should be similar in MDS with erythroid hyperplasia (MDS-E) and MDS with no erythroid hyperplasia (MDS-NE), and from this perspective, we retrospectively analyzed 322 patients, including 44 with MDS-E and 278 with MDS-NE. Overall survival was similar between the MDS-E and MDS-NE groups (P = 0.94). In a subgroup of patients with bone marrow (BM) blasts of < 5%, no difference in survival was found between MDS-E and MDS-NE by either calculation method. However, in patients with a blast percentage between 5 and 10%, a significant difference in survival was observed only when the blast percentage in MDS-E was calculated from ANC (P < 0.001 by ANC and P = 0.66 by NEC). A similar result was observed when we analyzed the remaining patients with higher blasts together with those with blasts between 5 and 10%. These results suggest that the calculation of the BM blast percentage based on NEC in MDS-E provides a blast percentage value with a clinical impact consistent with that in MDS-NE.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken, 329-0498, Japan. ycanda-tky@umin.ac.jp.']",,20181124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ITPA and NUDT15 polymorphisms appear more important in the Asian population. METHOD: In this study 63 consecutive patients with ALL, entering maintenance phase of therapy, were evaluated for TPMT, ITPA and NUDT15 polymorphisms by PCR RFLP and confirmed by sequencing. Hematological and hepatic toxicities were monitored for 36 weeks. The groups with and without any of the three studied polymorphisms (Risk SNP + and Risk SNP-) were compared. RESULTS: Eighteen (28.6%) patients had major polymorphisms, 17 being heterozygous. ITPA(198CA): 11(17.5%); NUDT (415CT): 6(9.5%) and TPMT*3C: in 2(3.1%). Mean cumulative dose of 6MP was lower: 10927 mg/m(2) in group with one of the polymorphisms compared to 12533 mg/m(2) in the group without a polymorphism (p = 0.009). The group with Risk SNP + tolerated lesser weeks of full-dose 6MP chemotherapy (20.81 vs 30.40 weeks; p = 0.001). Risk of neutropenia > 3 weeks was pronounced in Risk SNP + group. The individual TPMT, ITPA and NUDT15 polymorphism subgroups had similar cumulative 6MP dose and chemotherapy interruptions. There was no difference in the average cumulative dose of methotrexate in the two groups. No significant hepatotoxicity was noted.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a mammalian dNTP hydrolase (dNTPase) and functions as a negative regulator in the efficacy of cytarabine treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have reported that SAMHD1 knockout (KO) increased the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in AML-derived THP-1 cells and attenuated their ability to form subcutaneous tumors in xenografted immunodeficient mice. However, the functional significance of SAMHD1 in controlling AML leukemogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies show that in vitro transformation of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) envelope protein requires activation of the PI3K/Akt oncogenic signaling pathway. Using this cell transformation model, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of wild-type human SAMHD1 or a dNTPase-defective SAMHD1 mutant (HD/AA) significantly inhibited MDCK cell transformation, but did not affect cell proliferation. To visualize and quantify THP-1 cell growth and metastasis in xenografted immunodeficient mice, we generated luciferase-expressing stable SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells and control THP-1 cells, which were injected intravenously into immunodeficient mice. Bioluminescence imaging and quantification analysis of xenografted mice revealed that SAMHD1 KO cell-derived tumors had similar growth and metastatic potential compared with control cells at 35 days post-injection. However, mice xenografted with SAMHD1 KO cells showed greater survival compared with mice injected with control cells. Our data suggest that exogenous SAMHD1 expression suppresses in vitro cell transformation independently of its dNTPase activity, and that endogenous SAMHD1 affects AML tumorigenicity and disease progression in vivo.","['a Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'b Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'c Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'd Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'c Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'd Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5468-2487'],20181204,,,"['R01 GM132069/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI120209/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM128212/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI112381/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI150473/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6300106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Posaconazole is associated with elevated LFTs in approximately 5%-10% of patients. Recently, DiPippo, et al demonstrated that switching to isavuconazole in such cases leads to a reduction in LFTs in the majority of patients. However, the LFTs in such patients may have declined with time while continuing on posaconazole therapy. We retrospectively assessed LFT kinetics in 157 AML patients receiving posaconazole for antifungal prophylaxis and found that in 27 patients who developed grade 2 or higher CTCAE hepatotoxicity, 85% (23/27) had lower LFTs at the end of posaconazole therapy, despite continuation in the setting of hepatotoxicity, and this change from maximum LFTs was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Thus, the development of LFT abnormalities while on posaconazole therapy may not warrant a switch to an alternative, potentially less effective antifungal, as hepatotoxicity is often multifactorial and generally resolves with time in the majority of patients.","['Michigan Medicine Department of Pharmacy, The University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Michigan Medicine Department of Pharmacy, The University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0436-8948'],20181218,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed discontinuous ring-enhancing lesions compatible with the ""open ring"" sign, which was considered a demyelinating disorder, in both the frontal lobes. However, on histological examination of the biopsied specimen, infiltration of small lymphocytes positive for CD5, CD20, and CD23, indicating brain invasion by CLL, was seen. The leukemia cells occupied the Virchow-Robin space and infiltrated into the brain parenchyma. The arterioles in the Virchow-Robin space were compressed and occluded with the tumor cells, while CD163-positive cells infiltrated the brain parenchyma. Myelin staining demonstrated myelinoclasis in the infiltrated brain tissue. The MRI findings in the present case probably reflected myelinoclasis, suggesting rare brain invasion by CLL.

Moreover, evidence accumulates suggesting that socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors may have an impact on survival also in high-income countries. The aim of this review is to summarize the findings from studies on social factors and survival in childhood cancer. Several types of cancer and social factors are included in order to shed light on potential mechanisms and identify particularly affected groups. A literature search conducted in PubMed identified 333 articles published from December 2012 until June 2018, of which 24 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The findings are diverse; some studies found no associations but several indicated a social gradient with higher mortality among children from families of lower socioeconomic status (SES). There were no clear suggestions of particularly vulnerable subgroups, but hematological malignancies were most commonly investigated. A wide range of social factors have been examined and seem to be of different importance and varying between studies. However, potential underlying mechanisms linking a specific social factor to childhood cancer survival was seldom described. This review provides some support for a relationship between lower parental SES and worse survival after childhood cancer, which is a finding that needs further attention. Studies investigating predefined hypotheses involving specific social factors within homogenous cancer types are lacking and would increase the understanding of mechanisms involved, and allow targeted interventions to reduce health inequalities.","['Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,20181031,,,,,PMC6238081,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 25.,"AIMS: Mounting studies have confirmed that cancer cells reprogram their metabolism during early carcinogenesis to develop many other hallmarks, and demonstrated a relationship between aerobic glycolysis and the occurrence of drug resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms and role in tumor drug resistance of aerobic glycolysis remain unclear. MAIN METHODS: We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the RNA level between the multi-drug resistance (MDR) leukemia cell line K562/adriamycin (ADM) and its parental, drug-sensitive K562 cell line. Clustering and enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed. Oxamate, a lactic dehydrogenase inhibitor were used to assess the effect of glycolysis inhibition on ADM susceptibility and the expression of the enriched DEGs in K562/ADM cells. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 1742 DEGs were detected between the K562/ADM and K562 cell lines. The differential expression of unigenes encoding enzymes involved in glycometabolism signifies that there was a greater aerobic glycolysis flux in K562/ADM cells. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is related to glucose metabolism, showed representative differential enrichment and up-regulation in K562/ADM cells. Oxamate improved and re-sensitized the therapeutic effect of ADM in ADM-resistant cells by inhibiting aerobic glycolysis either directly or indirectly by down-regulation of the AKT-mTOR pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that ADM resistance mediated by the increase of aerobic glycolysis, which related to the over-activation of the AKT-mTOR-c-Myc pathway in MDR leukemia cells.

The authors' aim in this work is to clarify and assess the effect of coexistence and interconnection phenomenon on the healthy and cancerous stem cell dynamics. To this end, they perform the analysis of two time-delayed stem cell models in acute myeloid leukaemia. The first model is based on decoupled healthy and cancerous stem cell populations (i.e. there is no interaction between cell dynamics) and the second model includes interconnection between both population's dynamics. By using the positivity of both systems, they build new linear functions that permit to derive global stability conditions for each model. Moreover, knowing that most common types of haematological diseases are characterised by the existence of oscillations, they give conditions for the existence of a limit cycle (oscillations) in a particularly interesting healthy situation based on Poincare-Bendixson theorem. The obtained results are simulated and interpreted to be significant in understanding the effect of interconnection and would lead to an improvement in leukaemia treatment.","['Laboratory of Process Control LCP, Department of Engineering, Control Systems and Applied Mathematics, National Polytechnic School ENP of Algiers, 10, St Hacen Badi El Harrach, Algiers, Algeria. abdelhafid.zenati@g.enp.edu.dz.', 'Laboratory of Process Control LCP, Department of Engineering, Control Systems and Applied Mathematics, National Polytechnic School ENP of Algiers, 10, St Hacen Badi El Harrach, Algiers, Algeria.', 'Laboratory of Process Control LCP, Department of Engineering, Control Systems and Applied Mathematics, National Polytechnic School ENP of Algiers, 10, St Hacen Badi El Harrach, Algiers, Algeria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So cancer classification cannot rely only on doctor's thoughts. As a result, intelligent algorithms concerning doctor's help are inevitable. Therefore, the authors are motivated to suggest a novel algorithm to classify three cancer datasets; colon, ALL-AML, and leukaemia cancers. Their proposed algorithm is based on the deep neural network and emotional learning process. First of all, by applying the principal component analysis, they had a feature reduction. Then, they used deep neural as a feature extraction. Then, they implemented different classifiers; multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and Gaussian mixture model. In the end, because in the real world, especially when working on systems biology, unpredictable events, and uncertainties are undeniable, the robustness of their model against uncertainties is important. So they added Gaussian noise to the input features of the first encoder in each dataset, then, they applied the stacked denoising method. Experimental results disclosed that, generally, using emotional learning increased the accuracy. In addition, the highest accuracy was gained by SVM, 91.66, 92.27, and 96.56% for colon, ALL-AML, and leukaemia, respectively. However, GMM led to the lowest accuracy. The best accuracy gained by GMM was 60%.","['Department of Electrical Engineering, K.N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, K.N.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are the most frequent tyrosine kinase mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the former conferring a poor prognosis. We have recently revealed that FLT3-ITD confers resistance to the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors by protecting the mTORC1/4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway through Pim kinases induced by STAT5 activation in AML. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has recently been reported as a promising agent for treatment of AML. Here, we show that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as well as carfilzomib induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway more conspicuously in cells transformed by FLT3-TKD than FLT3-ITD. Mechanistically, bortezomib upregulated the stress-regulated protein REDD1 and induced downregulation of the mTORC1 pathway more distinctively in cells transformed by FLT3-TKD than FLT-ITD, while overexpression of Pim-1 partly prevented this downregulation and apoptosis in FLT3-TKD-transformed cells. Genetic enhancement of the REDD1 induction or pharmacological inhibition of STAT5, Pim kinases, mTORC1, or S6K by specific inhibitors, such as pimozide, AZD1208, PIM447, rapamycin, and PF-4708671, accelerated the downregulation of mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway to enhance bortezomib-induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-expressing cells, including primary AML cells, while overexpression of Mcl-1 prevented induction of apoptosis. Thus, FLT3-ITD confers a resistance to the proteasome inhibitors on AML cells by protecting the mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway through the STAT5/Pim axis, and inhibition of these signaling events remarkably enhances the therapeutic efficacy.","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Clinical Laboratory, Medical Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.

The influence of storage temperature and time on ATO was evaluated. Low amounts of As(III) to As(V) conversions were observed when the As encapsulated with nanoliposome was incubated at 25 degrees C and 40 degrees C. However, As(III) was stable if the solution was maintained at 5 degrees C, even after 90 days. No formation of other As species was observed, indicating good stability of the encapsulated ATO.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"OBJECTIVES: We compared the performance of two frailty scoring systems in predicting survival among older patients with multiple myeloma: the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) frailty score (which includes age), and the Fried model for frailty (which does not). METHODS: From 2015 to 2018, all patients aged 75 years and older presenting at our institution with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma were approached for a frailty screening assessment. We first categorized patients' frailty using the Fried model. Then, using available deficit measures, we reclassified frailty using the IMWG approach. We compared the performance of the IMWG strategy to the Fried model in terms of association with overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 98 (92%) patients who consented to a baseline frailty assessment, we found 57% discordance among frailty classification between the two scoring systems. Using the IMWG strategy, 9% of the cohort was ""fit,"" 29% ""intermediate-fit,"" and 62% ""frail."" Using the Fried model, 29% of the cohort was ""robust,"" 52% ""pre-frail,"" and 19% ""frail."" Frailty category in the Fried model was predictive of overall survival among our cohort, while frailty category in the IMWG strategy was not (log-rank p = 0.04 vs. 0.34). CONCLUSION: Among our cohort of older patients with myeloma (aged 75 and higher), the Fried model appears to be a better predictor of survival compared to the IMWG strategy. These results suggest that using age as a criterion to identify frailty in older patients with multiple myeloma may limit treatment options for the functionally vigorous.","['Division of Population Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA.', 'Division of Population Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA.', 'Center for Myeloma, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA.', ""Division of Aging, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA."", 'Division of Population Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA.', 'Center for Myeloma, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA; Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Boston, USA.', 'Division of Population Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA; Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA; Center for Leukemia, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"BACKGROUND: Monosomy 7 (-7) or deletion in its long arm [del(7q)] is among the most common chromosomal abnormalities in myeloid malignancies. There are prognostic variations between -7 and del(7q) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics, response to treatment, and survival of patients with primary AML and MDS having -7 or del(7q) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 53 patients with primary AML and MDS. They were tested for chromosome 7 abnormality using FISH technique. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients had chromosome 7 abnormality and 22 did not. Lower complete remission and higher death rates were observed in patients with -7 (47.6% and 62%, respectively) when compared to patients with del(7q) (70% and 40%, respectively) with no significant difference (p=0.218 and 0.101, respectively). The median overall survival (OS) of patients with -7, del(7q) and normal chromosome 7 were 32.0, 43.0 and 50.0months, respectively, with significant statistical difference (p=0.001). This difference was evident between patients with -7 and those with normal chromosome 7 (p=0.001), and less evident between patients with -7 and those with del(7q) (p=0.021). CONCLUSION: Chromosome 7 analysis has clear impact on the outcome of myeloid malignancies. The prognostic variations between -7 and del(7q) is attributed to multiple factors. Cases with del(7q) have better outcome than cases with -7. FISH provides a powerful tool for detecting and monitoring patients with chromosome 7 abnormalities.","['Hematology Department, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid, occurring several times per cell cycle. To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on the epigenetic landscape, we investigated H3K79 methylation, which is produced by a single methyltransferase (Dot1l) with no known demethylase. Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence.","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Departments of Pathology and Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology and Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (IMBA), Vienna Biocenter (VBC), 1030 Vienna, Austria; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9601, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology and Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology and Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"Leukemias exhibit a dysregulated developmental program mediated through both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Although IKZF2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we found that it is dispensable for mouse and human HSC function. In contrast to its role as a tumor suppressor in hypodiploid B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we found that IKZF2 is required for myeloid leukemia. IKZF2 is highly expressed in leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and its deficiency results in defective LSC function. IKZF2 depletion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells reduced colony formation, increased differentiation and apoptosis, and delayed leukemogenesis. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and direct IKZF2 binding in MLL-AF9 LSCs demonstrate that IKZF2 regulates a HOXA9 self-renewal gene expression program and inhibits a C/EBP-driven differentiation program. Ectopic HOXA9 expression and CEBPE depletion rescued the effects of IKZF2 depletion. Thus, our study shows that IKZF2 regulates the AML LSC program and provides a rationale to therapeutically target IKZF2 in myeloid leukemia.","['Molecular Pharmacology Program and Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program and Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program and Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program and Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program and Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program and Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program and Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

While naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be maintained in a hypomethylated state with open chromatin when grown using two small-molecule inhibitors (2i)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in contrast to serum/LIF-grown ESCs that resemble early post-implantation embryos, broader features of the ground-state pluripotent epigenome are not well understood. We identified epigenetic features of mouse ESCs cultured using 2i/LIF or serum/LIF by proteomic profiling of chromatin-associated complexes and histone modifications. Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and its product H3K27me3 are highly abundant in 2i/LIF ESCs, and H3K27me3 is distributed genome-wide in a CpG-dependent fashion. Consistently, PRC2-deficient ESCs showed increased DNA methylation at sites normally occupied by H3K27me3 and increased H4 acetylation. Inhibiting DNA methylation in PRC2-deficient ESCs did not affect their viability or transcriptome. Our findings suggest a unique H3K27me3 configuration protects naive ESCs from lineage priming, and they reveal widespread epigenetic crosstalk in ground-state pluripotency.","['Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, CNRS-Universite de Montpellier UMR 9002, 34000 Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RadboudUMC), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RadboudUMC), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), Oncode Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, CNRS-Universite de Montpellier UMR 9002, 34000 Montpellier, France.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

This study aimed to examine the effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on EVI-1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow and peripheral blood of AML patients and healthy donors. EVI-1 expression in hematopoietic cells was evaluated by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. EVI-1 was highly expressed in both primary AML and leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and K562). ATO down-regulated EVI-1 mRNA in zebrafish in vivo as well as in primary leukemia cells and THP-1 and K562 cells in vitro. Additionally, ATO treatment induced apoptosis, down-regulated both EVI-1 mRNA and oncoprotein expression, increased the expression of pro-apoptosis proteins, and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in leukemia cells in vitro. EVI-1 expression in leukemia cells (THP-1 and K562) transduced with EVI-1 siRNA was significantly reduced. Silencing EVI-1 had a significant effect on the activation of the JNK pathway and the induction of leukemia cell apoptosis. ATO may downregulate EVI-1 mRNA and oncoprotein levels and block the inhibitory effects of EVI-1 on the JNK pathway, which activates the JNK apoptotic pathway, thereby leading to the apoptosis of EVI-1 in AML patients.","['Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai 200127, China.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"BACKGROUND: PARP-1 plays a critical role in DNA damage repair and contributes to progression of cancer. To explore the role of PARP-1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we analyzed the expression of PARP-1 in AML and its relation to the clinical prognosis. Then, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of PARP inhibitor BMN673 (Talazoparib) combined with NL101, a novel SAHA-bendamustine hybrid in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The expression of PARP-1 in 339 cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) cases was evaluated using RT-PCR. According to the expression of PARP-1, the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the patients were grouped and compared. The combination effects of BMN673 and NL101 were studied in AML cells and B-NSG mice xenograft model of MV4-11. FINDINGS: We found patients in high PARP-1 expression group had higher levels of blast cells in bone marrow (P=.003) and white blood cells (WBC) in peripheral blood (P=.008), and were associated with a more frequent FLT3-ITD mutation (28.2% vs 17.3%, P=.031). The overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) of the high expression group were significantly shorter than those in the low expression group (OS, P=.005 and EFS, P=.004). BMN673 combined with NL101 had a strong synergistic effect in treating AML. The combination significantly induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in G2/M phase. Mechanistically, BMN673 and NL101 combinatorial treatment promoted DNA damage. In vivo, the combination effectively delayed the development of AML and prolonged survival.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"BACKGROUND: The frequency, risk factors, and outcomes for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (AL) admitted for induction therapy are unclear. METHODS: We studied 509 consecutive patients with AL admitted between 2006 and 2017 and conducted a prospective C difficile surveillance and ribotyping analysis in a subset of these. RESULTS: The incidence of CDI was 2.2/1,000 inpatient days during induction, and CDI was rare after discharge. CDI was highest in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. A hospitalization shortly before admission and administration of a greater number of antibiotics increased the risk for CDI. No single class of antibiotics conveyed an increased risk. All cases were successfully treated, and CDI was not associated with an increase in length of stay, costs, or mortality. In a subgroup analysis, 16% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and 4% with other leukemia types were colonized on admission. Colonization was associated with a higher risk of CDI. Ribotyping of available isolates showed 27 different strain types with 014/020 and 027 being the most frequent. CONCLUSIONS: The number of antibiotics administered are a major risk factor for CDI in patients with AL. However, CDI appears to have minimal clinical impact in this population.","['Intermountain Acute Leukemia Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT.

However, osteosclerotic lesions are more common in myeloproliferative disorders. We report the unusual case of a patient with myeloproliferative syndrome in whom the development of osteolytic lesions revealed transformation to acute leukemia. In 2007, this 82-year-old man with essential thrombocythemia since 1994 developed primary polycythemia with the JAK2 mutation V617F. In July 2017, he was evaluated for an osteolytic lesion in the right humerus with incipient fracturing. Bone marrow smear results provided only limited information, due to the myelofibrosis, showing 7% of blast cells with no plasmacytosis. No solid malignancies were identified by imaging studies. Examination of a right humeral biopsy specimen taken during internal fixation showed myeloproliferative syndrome with osteosclerosis and grade-3 myelofibrosis, as well as a malignant proliferation of large cells carrying the leukocyte cluster of differentiation antigens CD45, CD 43, CD4, and CD34. The diagnosis was transformation of the myeloproliferative syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia. The development of an osteolytic lesion during the course of myeloproliferative syndrome is an exceedingly rare event that should suggest acute leukemic transformation.","[""Service de geriatrie, CHU d'Angers, 4, rue Larrey, 49933 Angers cedex 9, France."", ""Service de geriatrie, CHU d'Angers, 4, rue Larrey, 49933 Angers cedex 9, France."", ""Service de rhumatologie, CHU d'Angers, 4, rue Larrey, 49933 Angers cedex 9, France; Groupe d'Eudes Remodelage Osseux et bioMateriaux LHEA UPRES EA 4658, CHU d'Angers, 4, rue Larrey, 49933 Angers cedex 9, France.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"Fludarabine with busulfan (FB) or melphalan (FM) are 2 more commonly used reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT).We present a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing these 2 RIC regimens. We searched electronic databases from inception through November 1, 2017 for literature searches to identify relevant studies. A DerSimonian random effects model was used to measure efficacy outcomes; hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Seven studies, including a total of 1955 patients, met criteria for inclusion, of which 6 were included in the overall pooled analysis because of repetition of some patients in 2 studies. Three studies were included in the subgroup analysis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 2 in the subgroup analysis of lymphoid malignancies. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were not statistically significantly different between the 2 RIC regimens in analysis of all studies. However, OS was better with FM in subgroup analysis of AML/MDS studies (HR, .83; 95% CI, .73 to .95). Nonrelapse mortality was lower with FB (HR, .64; 95% CI, .46 to .89), whereas relapse was lower with FM (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.06) in the analysis of all studies. This meta-analysis shows that FB and FM are associated with a similar OS in patients undergoing HCT. Relapse rates are lower with FM but at the cost of higher nonrelapse mortality.","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.

Its role in other aggressive lymphomas and in patients with simultaneous central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral involvement is unclear. METHODS: This is a retrospective outcome analysis in 76 patients with BL (n = 26), B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL; n = 3), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 31), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n = 6), transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (tB-NHL; n = 7), and T-cell NHL (T-NHL; n = 3) treated with the GMALL-B-ALL/NHL2002 protocol. RESULTS: 73.1% of scheduled chemotherapy cycles were administered. Treatment was discontinued in 38 patients (50.0%) due to progression (n = 14), toxicities (n = 11), scheduled treatment change (n = 6), and unknown reasons (n = 7). All BL/B-LBL patients were treated first-line, and at a median follow-up of 124.7 months, median progression-free survival was not reached. In DLBCL, median PFS was 68.4 months in first-line treated patients and 3.7 months in relapsed/refractory patients. CNS involvement was present in 10 non-BL/B-LBL cases and did not have a negative impact on survival in first-line treated patients but was fatal in all relapsed/refractory patients. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the activity of the GMALL-B-ALL/NHL2002 protocol in BL/B-LBL. It was also effective in first-line treated non-BL/B-LBL lymphomas with and without simultaneous CNS-/peripheral involvement, but ineffective in relapsed/refractory disease.","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4034-9472', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2230-3873']",20190120,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The response to treatment and survival of adult patients with AML are still variable and depend on multiple factors. Therefore, there have been many efforts to improve the response to treatment and survival rates by either increasing the cytarabine dose or adding a third agent to the standard induction chemotherapy regimen. Unfortunately, attempts to improve response and survival have been mostly unsuccessful. Recent clinical trials and retrospective studies explored the addition of cladribine to standard induction chemotherapy for AML. Some of these studies showed higher rates of complete remission, and one showed improved survival. In this review, we will discuss the antileukemic properties of cladribine and summarize the recent clinical data regarding its incorporation into the induction therapy for adult AML.","['Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplant, Markey Cancer Center, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, 800 Rose St, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA. ahqasrawi@gmail.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2411 Holmes St, Kansas City, MO, 64108, USA.', 'Walmart Pharmacy, 5150 Roe Blvd, Roeland Park, KS, 66205, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2411 Holmes St, Kansas City, MO, 64108, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2411 Holmes St, Kansas City, MO, 64108, USA.', 'NCI Community Oncology Research Program - Kansas City (NCORP-KC), 4121 W 83rd St #259, Prairie Village, Kansas, USA.', 'KIM Cancer and Blood Center, 11227 Lakeview Ave, Lenexa, KS, 66219, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2233-6539'],20181123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 23.,"Pegylated interferon-alpha (peg-IFNa) treatment induces molecular responses (MR) in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including partial MR (PMR) in 30-40% of patients. Here, we compared the efficacy of IFNa treatment in JAK2V617F- vs. calreticulin (CALR)-mutated cells and investigated the mechanisms of differential response. Retrospective analysis of MPN patients treated with peg-IFNa demonstrated that patients harboring the JAK2V617F mutation were more likely to achieve PMR than those with mutated CALR (p = 0.004), while there was no significant difference in hematological response. In vitro experiments confirmed an upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes in JAK2V617F-positive 32D cells as well as patient samples (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells) compared to their CALR-mutated counterparts, and higher IFNa doses were needed to achieve the same IFNa response in CALR- as in JAK2V617F-mutant 32D cells. Additionally, Janus-activated kinase-1 (JAK1) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) showed constitutive phosphorylation in JAK2V617F-mutated but not CALR-mutated cells, indicating priming towards an IFNa response. Moreover, IFN-induced growth arrest was counteracted by selective JAK1 inhibition but enhanced by JAK2 inhibition. In conclusion, our data suggest that, clinically, higher doses of IFNa are needed in CALR-mutated vs. JAK2V617F-positive patients and we suggest a model of JAK2V617F-JAK1/STAT1 crosstalk leading to a priming of JAK2V617F-positive cells to IFNa resulting in differential sensitivity.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, Joint Research Center for Computational Biomedicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, Joint Research Center for Computational Biomedicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research Aachen Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. skoschmieder@ukaachen.de.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-8697', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3764-8578', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4485-3120', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1011-8171']",20181123,['Leukemia. 2020 Apr;34(4):1210-1212.

Epub 2018 Nov 23.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations. T(4;14) MM overexpresses multiple myeloma SET domain-containing protein (MMSET). MMSET has three major isoforms: the full-length form MMSET II and the short isoforms REIIBP and MMSET I. Here we show that the short isoform MMSET I is an oncoprotein that promoted cell survival and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression array analysis indicated that MMSET I increased glyoxalase I (GLO1) expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with qPCR indicated that MMSET I bound upstream of the GLO1 transcription start site. Ectopic overexpression of MMSET I or its mutants showed MMSET I depended on its C terminus to regulate GLO1 expression. GLO1 knockdown (KD) induced apoptosis and reduced colony formation. MMSET I or GLO1 KD reduced the levels of anti-apoptosis factors such as MCL1 and BCL2. Ectopic overexpression of GLO1 resulted in the significant rescue of KMS11 cells from MMSET I KD-induced apoptosis and glycolysis inhibition. This suggested that GLO1 may be of functional importance target downstream of MMSET I. Cumulatively, our study suggests that MMSET I is an oncoprotein and potential therapeutic target for t(4;14) MM.","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117599, Singapore.', 'Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138668, Singapore.', 'Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138668, Singapore.', 'Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138668, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117599, Singapore. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119228, Singapore. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg.', 'National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore, 119228, Singapore. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg.']",,20181123,,,"['NMRC/OFYIRG/0010/2016/MOH | National Medical Research Council', '(NMRC)/International', 'STaR Investigatorship/MOH | National Medical Research Council', '(NMRC)/International', 'MOE2014-T3-1-006/Ministry of Education - Singapore (MOE)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 23.,"DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) approved for older AML patients are clinically tested in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). The mechanism of action of these drugs is still under debate. In colon cancer cells, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) can downregulate oncogenes and metabolic genes by reversing gene body DNA methylation, thus implicating gene body methylation as a novel drug target. We asked whether DAC-induced gene body demethylation in AML cells is also associated with gene repression, and whether the latter is enhanced by HDACi.Transcriptome analyses revealed that a combined treatment with DAC and the HDACi panobinostat or valproic acid affected significantly more transcripts than the sum of the genes regulated by either treatment alone, demonstrating a quantitative synergistic effect on genome-wide expression in U937 cells. This effect was particularly striking for downregulated genes. Integrative methylome and transcriptome analyses showed that a massive downregulation of genes, including oncogenes (e.g., MYC) and epigenetic modifiers (e.g., KDM2B, SUV39H1) often overexpressed in cancer, was associated predominantly with gene body DNA demethylation and changes in acH3K9/27. These findings have implications for the mechanism of action of combined epigenetic treatments, and for a better understanding of responses in trials where this approach is clinically tested.","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Genetic Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'DKTK, German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8460-0462', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2554-3952']",20181123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 23.,"Many acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) express high levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1, especially after therapy. To test the impact of these anti-apoptotic proteins on AML development and treatment, we used haemopoietic reconstitution to generate MLL-AF9 AMLs expressing BCL-2 or Mcl-1 transgenes. AMLs with elevated BCL-2 or MCL-1 had a higher proportion of mature myeloid cells but, like conventional MLL-AF9 AMLs, were readily transplantable. Short-term cell lines established from multiple primary AMLs of each genotype were tested in vitro for susceptibility to chemotherapeutics currently used for treating AML (daunorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine); the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib; CDK7/9 inhibitors; and BH3 mimetics, which bind and inhibit pro-survival proteins. The BH3 mimetics tested, alone and in combination with the other drugs, were: ABT-737 which, like its clinical counterpart navitoclax, targets BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-W; BCL-2-specific ABT-199 (venetoclax); BCL-XL-specific A-1331852; and S63845, a new MCL-1-specific BH3 mimetic. As single agents, daunorubicin and bortezomib had the greatest efficacy. Elevated MCL-1 or BCL-2 reduced sensitivity to daunorubicin but, surprisingly, not to bortezomib. MCL-1 markedly enhanced resistance to ABT-737 and ABT-199 but not S63845, and BCL-2 increased resistance to S63845 but not to ABT-737 or ABT-199. Notable synergies were achieved by combining BH3 mimetics with daunorubicin: S63845 increased the sensitivity of both MCL-1 and BCL-2 overexpressing MLL-AF9 AMLs, and ABT-737 aided in killing those overexpressing BCL-2. Synergy between daunorubicin and ABT-199 was also apparent in vivo, although not curative. Impressive synergistic responses were achieved for human MLL-fusion AML cell lines treated with daunorubicin plus either ABT-737, ABT-199 or S63845, and with ABT-199 plus S63845, with or without daunorubicin. Our data suggest that AML patients may benefit from combining conventional cytotoxic drugs with BH3 mimetics targeting BCL-2 or MCL-1 or, if tolerated, both these agents.","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Experimental Hematology Division, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia. cory@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia. cory@wehi.edu.au.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9690-0879', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6818-3451']",20181123,,,,,PMC6748137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maternal immune stress by bacterial infection simulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in an experiment is considered to be a powerful programming factor of fetal development. Studies of the molecular mechanisms controlling the formation and functioning of physiological systems are in the pilot stage. LPSs are the most potent natural inflammation factors. LPS-induced increases in fetal levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines can affect brain development and have long-term effects on behavior and neuroendocrine functions. The degradation of serotonergic neurons induced by LPS in the fetus is attributed to the increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) as well as to anxiety and depression in children. Dopamine deficiency causes dysthymia, learning disability, and Parkinson's disease. According to our data, an LPS-induced increase in the levels of IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) in maternal and fetal rats during early pregnancy disturbs the development and functioning of gonadotropin-releasing hormone production and reproductive systems. It is important to note the high responsiveness of epigenetic developmental mechanisms to many regulatory factors, which offers opportunities to correct the defects.","['Koltsov Institute of Developmental Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia. izvolskaya@hotmail.com.', 'Koltsov Institute of Developmental Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia. sarovav@mail.ru.', 'Koltsov Institute of Developmental Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia. l-a-zakharova@mail.ru.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4350-7042'],20181121,,,['0108-2018-0002/Government program of basic reserach'],,PMC6274672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of coptisine on allergic rhinitis has not been investigated. In this study, we report the effects and mechanisms of coptisine using monoclonal anti-2,4,6-dinitrophenyl-immunoglobulin (Ig) E/human serum albumin (DNP-IgE/HSA)-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3 cells) in vitro and an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis (AR) in mice. The results showed that coptisine markedly decreased the levels of beta-hexosaminidase, histamine, interleukin (IL)-4, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Coptisine also prevented morphological changes, such as restoring an elongated shape, inhibiting granule release on toluidine blue staining, and reorganizing inhibited filamentous actins (F-actin). Additionally, coptisine blocked the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (as known as protein kinase B(PKB)) in RBL-2H3 cell. Furthermore, the results showed that coptisine suppressed OVA-induced allergic rhinitis symptoms, such as nasal rubbing and OVA-specific IgE, and histamine, IL-4 and TNF-alpha levels in the serum of AR mice. These data suggested that coptisine should have inhibitory effects on the inflammatory responses of mast cells, and may be beneficial for the development of coptisine as a potential anti-allergic drug.","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China. fusl16@mails.jlu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China. nish16@mails.jlu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China. wangdn17@mails.jlu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China. hongtie@jlu.edu.cn.']",,20181121,,,,,PMC6278392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose is to determine the correlation between the observed CR/CRi rate after idarubicin (IDA) and cytarabine (CYT) 3 + 7 induction and the leukemic chemosensitivity measured by an ex vivo test of drug activity. Bone marrow samples from adult patients with newly diagnosed AML were included in this study. Whole bone marrow samples were incubated for 48 h in well plates containing IDA, CYT, or their combination. Pharmacological response parameters were estimated using population pharmacodynamic models. Patients attaining a CR/CRi with up to two induction cycles of 3 + 7 were classified as responders and the remaining as resistant. A total of 123 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were evaluable for correlation analyses. The strongest clinical predictors were the area under the curve of the concentration response curves of CYT and IDA. The overall accuracy achieved using MaxSpSe criteria to define positivity was 81%, predicting better responder (93%) than non-responder patients (60%). The ex vivo test provides better yet similar information than cytogenetics, but can be provided before treatment representing a valuable in-time addition. After validation in an external cohort, this novel ex vivo test could be useful to select AML patients for 3 + 7 regimen vs. alternative schedules.","['Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital de Madrid Norte Sanchinarro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario General de Castellon, Castellon, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Doctor Negrin, Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hospital General Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Lucus Augusti, Lugo, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen, Jaen, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Medicxact, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is an important regulatory machinery involved in proteostasis and cellular signaling. Proteins are ubiquitinated via the concerted action of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. Although most of the studies to date focus on the significance of E3 ubiquitin ligases in disease development and therapeutic treatment, recent discoveries suggest that E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes might also be potential drug targets. The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 O (UBE2O), an E3-independent E2 (i.e. an E2/E3 hybrid enzyme), can directly mediate the ubiquitination of many substrates. These include 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha2 (AMPKalpha2), tumor suppressor ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase BAP1, mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein, SMAD family member 6 (SMAD6), transcription factor c-Maf and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (ARNTL or BMAL1), and free ribosomal proteins, which are ubiquitinated in distinct ways, thereby associating UBE2O with a variety of biological functions. Furthermore, UBE2O is frequently amplified or mutated in multiple cancers, and its high expression is associated with low survival rate of gastric, lung, breast, and prostate cancer patients. However, the molecular mechanisms by which UBE2O contributes to tumor initiation and progression are not fully elucidated. This review focuses on emerging insights from genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology to explore the biological functions of UBE2O and its therapeutic potential.","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Preventive and Translational Medicine for Geriatric Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at El Paso, TX, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at El Paso, TX, USA.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Preventive and Translational Medicine for Geriatric Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Preventive and Translational Medicine for Geriatric Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.']",,20181204,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression level of miR-10b in clinical AML cases and cell lines was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The interaction between miR-10b and homeobox D10 (HOXD10) was confirmed by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and Luciferase assay. The effect of miR-10b on biological functions of AML cell line (HL60) was analyzed in vitro. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay and colony formation assay were used to detect the proliferation and colony formation ability of AML cells, respectively. Meanwhile, fl ow cytometry and TUNEL staining were applied to measure cell cycle and apoptosis of AML cells, respectively. RESULTS: miR-10b was significantly up-regulated in AML cases and cell lines. The potential target genes of miR-10b were analyzed by three public databases. Results showed that HOXD10 was a direct target of miR-10b. QRT-PCR, Western blotting and luciferase assay confirmed the regulatory effect of miR-10b on HOXD10. Overexpression of miR-10b accelerated the proliferation and colony formation ability of AML cells. Meanwhile, miR-10b overexpression decreased the percentage of AML cells in the G0/G1 phase when compared with S phase, and suppressed the apoptosis of AML cells. However, the addition of HOXD10 could reverse the effects of miR-10b. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-10b could regulate the proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle and apoptosis of AML cells through targeting HOXD10, indicating that miR-10b might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AML.","['Laboratory Medicine, Wendeng Orthopedics Hospital of Shandong Province, Wendeng, China. shixianhuiqing@163.com.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of lncRNAs in AML patients still remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the expression level of lncRNA LINC00899 (LINC00899) and its potential for diagnosis and prognosis in AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression levels of LINC00899 in bone marrow and serum obtained from AML patients and healthy controls were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of serum LINC00899. The association between serum LINC00899 expression and clinicopathological factors as well as the overall survival were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that the levels of serum LINC00899 were frequently upregulated in the bone marrow and serum of AML patients. Higher expression of serum LINC00899 was positively associated with FAB classification (p = 0.002) and cytogenetics (p = 0.005). Moreover, ROC curve analyses showed that serum LINC00899 could discriminate AML patients from healthy controls with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.807 (95% CI, 0.7262- 0.8752). In addition, the serum LINC00899 expression level was significantly reduced when the patients achieved complete remission. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high serum LINC00899 expression had a shorter overall survival compared with the low serum LINC00899 expression group (p = 0.0013). Finally, Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that high serum LINC00899 expression was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We firstly found that serum LINC00899 might be a potential and useful noninvasive biomarker for the early clinical detection and prognosis of AML.","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China. ss33ss13@126.com.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulatory T cells (Treg) is a T cell subgroup featured as immunosuppressive function. Existing CIK cultivation system may inevitably induce Treg. Forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) is an essential transcription factor for Treg function. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CIK on the leukemia cell HL-60. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work silenced Foxp3 expression on the basis of CIK induction, aiming to investigate its killing effect on HL-60 cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated and differentiated to CIK in vitro. CD3+CD56+ and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells were detected by flow cytometry. CIK cells were co-cultured with HL-60 cells under the effector-target ratio at 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1, respectively. The killing activity of CIK on HL-60 cells was determined by CCK-8 assay. RESULTS: The ratio of CD3+, CD3+CD8+, and CD3+CD56+ cells gradually increased during CIK induction. Foxp3 interference significantly reduced Treg cell ratio on the 7th day (p < 0.05). Treg cell ratio was significantly lower in Foxp3 interference group at 1.62% +/- 0.07% compared with control (p < 0.05). The killing activity of CIK on HL-60 cells enhanced following the increase of effector-target ratio. Interference of Foxp3 significantly elevated the killing activity of CIK on HL-60 cells with effector-target ratio dependence (p < 0.05). CIK can effectively suppress HL-60 cell growth. Treg significantly inhibited the anti-tumor effect of CIK. CONCLUSIONS: Interference of Foxp3 expression significantly declined Treg level and attenuated its suppression impact on CIK, thus enhancing the killing effect of CIK on HL-60 cells.","[""Department of Cardiovascular, Gaotang County People's Hospital of Shandong Province, LiaoCheng, Shandong, China. gdzadsqlnq@sina.com.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jan 16.,"The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has been shown to be highly effective in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and is approved for CLL treatment. Unfortunately, resistance and intolerance to ibrutinib has been observed in several studies, opening the door for more specific BTK inhibitors. CC-292 (spebrutinib) is a BTK inhibitor with increased specificity for BTK and less inhibition of other kinases. Our in vitro studies showed that CC-292 potently inhibited B-cell receptor signaling, activation, proliferation and chemotaxis of CLL cells. In in vivo studies using the adoptive transfer TCL1 mouse model of CLL, CC-292 reduced tumor load and normalized tumor-associated expansion of T cells and monocytes, while not affecting T cell function. Importantly, the combination of CC-292 and bendamustine impaired CLL cell proliferation in vivo and enhanced the control of CLL progression. Our results demonstrate that CC-292 is a specific BTK inhibitor with promising performance in combination with bendamustine in CLL. Further clinical trials are warranted to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of this combination regimen.","[""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7486-8484'],20190116,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,"Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl -1) is one of the most frequently amplified genes in cancer, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance. As a member of the Bcl-2 family it is involved in the control of the mitochondrial (intrinsic) cell death pathway. Alternative splicing of the (Mcl-1) gene results in the expression of two functionally distinct proteins, the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L (exon 2 included) and the pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S (exon 2 skipped). Our data shows that transfecting siRNAs that target hnRNP K and the hnRNP F/H family result in a switch in splicing towards the pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S. Specific binding sites for these and other Mcl-1 splicing factors were investigated and identified by RNA immunoprecipitation and through construction of a Mcl-1 minigene construct. Moreover, this study shows up to a 30 fold change in the levels of Mcl-1S can be achieved through double and triple knockdowns of the most significant RNA binding proteins involved in Mcl-1 splicing, as well as activation of the mitochondrial cell death pathway. Targeting the splicing process of Mcl-1 along with other apoptotic regulators provides an exciting new therapeutic target in cancer cells, and may provide a way to overcome therapy resistance.","['a Institute of Cellular Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences , Newcastle University , Newcastle upon Tyne , UK.', 'a Institute of Cellular Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences , Newcastle University , Newcastle upon Tyne , UK.']",,20181204,,,,,PMC6333436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 23.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a critical role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in MMP-9 secretion of BEAS-2B cells, a human bronchial epithelial cell line and U937 cells, a human myeloid leukaemia cell line, which could differentiate into macrophage, after LPS stimulation, and some details of involved signaling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MTT assay was used to measure cell viability. U937 cells were incubated for 48h with 100ng/ml PMA, and had a resting period of 24h with culture medium without PMA for differentiation of U937 cells into macrophages. For the experiments, U937 cells or BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with several inhibitors and then stimulated by LPS. Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and DNA binding activity assay were used for measuring the protein expression, RNA expression, cytokine production and DNA binding activity, respectively. RESULTS: We found LPS induced MMP-9 expression and secretion were completely blocked by stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase (SAPK/JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitors but not by p38 inhibitor. LPS-induced transactivation of AP-1 was also inhibited by JNK inhibitor SP600125 and ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that in BEAS-2B cells and U937 cells, LPS probably activates ERK1/2 pathway and JNK pathway, which in turn initiate AP-1 activity, and leading to MMP-9 expression. Thus the ERK1/2 inhibitor and JNK inhibitor may have potential clinical value in treating COPD.","['a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , PR China.', 'a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , PR China.', 'a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , PR China.', 'a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , PR China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3403-8464'],20181123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 23.,"IL-10-producing B cells (B10) are associated with autoimmune diseases, infection and tumours. MiR-15a/16 as a tumour-suppressive gene is down-regulated in several tumours, such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, pituitary adenomas and prostate carcinoma. Here, increased frequency of IL-10-producing CD19(+) Tim-1(+) cells was seen in both aged miR-15a/16(-/-) mice (15-18 months) with the onset of B cell leukaemia and young knockout mice (8-12 weeks) transplanted with hepatic cancer cells. CD19(+) Tim-1(+) cells down-regulated the function of effector CD4(+) CD25(low) T cells ex vivo dependent on IL-10 production, and adoptive transfer of CD19(+) Tim-1(+) cells promoted tumour growth in mice. IL-10 production by CD19(+) Tim-1(+) cells was involved with the STAT3 activation. Bioinformatics analysis shows that miR-16 targets the 3'-untranslating region (3'-UTR) of STAT3 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-16 in CD19(+) Tim-1(+) cells inhibited STAT3 transcription and its protein expression. Thus, the loss of miR-15a/16 promoted induction of regulatory CD19(+) Tim-1(+) cells in tumour microenvironment. These results confirmed that miR-15a/16 could be used in tumour therapy due to its inhibition of tumour and regulatory B cells.","['Department of Basic Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, Medical College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, P.R.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) offers potentially curative therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with Alemtuzumab reduces transplant-related mortality and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), but may be associated with increased risk of relapse. With the aim of studying the effect of GVHD and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) on relapse, we performed a retrospective study of 288 patients (57% non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 24% Hodgkin lymphoma and 19% chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; 58% were relapsed/refractory) who underwent RIC-Alemtuzumab-HSCT between 2000 and 2012. Median follow-up time for survivors was 64 months. Five-year overall survival, relapse incidence, GvHD/relapse-free survival and non-relapse mortality were 47%, 33%, 37% and 28% respectively. Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute and extensive chronic GvHD was 22% and 21% at 100 days and 5 years respectively. On multivariate analysis, presence of GvHD (P = 0.03) and unrelated donor type (P = 0.03) were protective of relapse. 62/288 patients received DLI for either mixed donor chimerism (prophylactic DLI, n = 37) or clinical relapse (therapeutic DLI, n = 25). Prophylactic and therapeutic DLI successfully converted the patient to full or stable mixed donor chimerism in 78% and 56% of patients respectively. These data demonstrate good long-term outcomes and support the concept of the graft-vs-lymphoma effect as a key protective factor against relapse following RIC-Alemtuzumab allo-HSCT for patients with mature lymphoid malignancies.","['Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia Celular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4028-3733', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0094-619X']",20181122,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

While allogeneic transplantation still remains the only potential curative treatment option, it can only be offered to a limited number of patients. For the majority, who are not transplant candidates, treatment strategies cover iron chelation, growth factors, lenalidomide, and hypomethylating agents to improve cytopenia and potentially delay disease progression. These limited options underpin the urgent need for more translational research-based clinical trials in well-defined subgroups of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Indeed, myelodysplastic syndromes are a moving target with maximum innovation in the understanding of the complex molecular pathways during the last decade. Compared with other hematological diseases such as myeloma, this has unfortunately not yet translated into approval of novel treatment options. Given the current developments in the field, we are optimistic that recent frustrations will be overcome shortly and this will pave the way for exciting opportunities, especially for patients not responding to first-line therapeutic options.","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.

The overall aim of this study was to explore HRQOL in children with cancer in two countries, Argentina and Sweden, which have different cultural contexts. The specific aims were: to determine HRQOL by gender, age, diagnosis, treatment modality, time since diagnosis, and parental education/employment across cultures. Further aims were to assess the child/parent relationship in HRQOL and the influence of demographic variables in psychosocial and physical HRQOL in each country. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 2014, including 58 children (24 females, 34 males) and 62 parents/guardians. The instrument, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL, generic, cancer and fatigue modules), and medical records were used. The response rate was 97%. RESULTS: The mean age of the children was 8.67 years (SD 5.1, range 2-18 years) and the mean time on treatment was 10.7 months (SD 8.7, range 1-30 months). The most common diagnosis was leukaemia (57%). In Argentina, in comparison with Sweden, a higher estimation of generic HRQOL was reported among adolescents (p = 0.022) and more cancer-related problems among school-age children (p < 0.0001). Children and parents in both countries confirmed the major problem with fatigue and multimodality therapy regimes, but lower levels of fatigue were reported in Argentina. Adolescents and children with solid tumours appeared as vulnerable groups. In Sweden, children whose mothers had post-secondary education reported less cancer-related problems (p = 0.031). Good relationships were found between child/parent reports in Argentina regarding the fatigue module (p = 0.034) and physical subscale (p = 0.014), and in Sweden regarding generic health (p = 0.004), including psychosocial (p = 0.006) and physical subscales (p = 0.042), and cancer (p = 0.001), and fatigue (p < 0.0001) modules. In Sweden, psychosocial health (OR 7.5; p = 0.007) and physical health (OR 6.2; p = 0.011) were positively influenced by being a school-age child. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is as a major problem across cultures. Still, being in school facilitates recovery. Good relationships in psychosocial HRQOL highlight professional challenges regarding severe issues and open communication, and the need of performing comparative studies of HRQOL of children with cancer from different cultural backgrounds.","['Department of Orthopaedics, Sodra Alvsborg Hospital, Bramhultsvagen 53, SE-501 82, Boras, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, SE- 416 85, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Instituto de Hematologia y Oncologia del Rosario, San Juan 2395 (2000), Rosario, Pcia Santa Fe, Argentina.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, SE- 416 85, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, SE- 416 85, Gothenburg, Sweden. margaretha.stenmarker@rjl.se.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Futurum - the academy for health and care, Region Jonkoping Council, SE-551 85, Jonkoping, Sweden. margaretha.stenmarker@rjl.se.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9631-5757'],20181017,,,,,PMC6192945,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the spectrum of illness caused by CMV is well-documented in immunocompromised patients, the clinical course and evolution of lung changes after initiation of antiviral therapy remain unclear. CASE REPORT We present the cases of 3 patients with leukemia who developed CMV pneumonia following cord blood transplantation and who presented with distinctive features on chest computed tomography (CT). In all patients, chest CT showed central peribronchial changes with severe lung volume loss. Furthermore, the patients were refractory to high-dose steroids, and the lung volume loss rapidly progressed, leading to death from respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS We observed central peribronchial changes with severe lung volume loss after the acute phase in 3 cases of CMV pneumonia. While our diagnosis was made on the basis of exclusion, it is important to bear in mind that lung involvement in CMV pneumonia may be refractory to various treatment modalities and can lead to a fatal clinical course.","['Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Health Professional Development Center, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respirology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.']",,20181123,,,,,PMC6266627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we report a novel, efficient, convergent synthesis of dibenzyl butyrolactone lignans utilizing the acyl-Claisen rearrangement to stereoselectively prepare a key intermediate. The reported synthetic route enables the modification of these lignans to give rise to 5-hydroxymethyl derivatives of these lignans. The biological activities of these analogues were assessed, with derivatives showing an excellent cytotoxic profile which resulted in programmed cell death of Jurkat T-leukemia cells with less than 2% of the incubated cells entering a necrotic cell death pathway.","['School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland, Aucklamd 1010, New Zealand. sdav134@aucklanduni.ac.nz.', 'School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland, Aucklamd 1010, New Zealand. lisa.pilkington@auckland.ac.nz.', 'School of Healthcare Science, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester M1 5GD, UK.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and thymoma are distinct primary mediastinal neoplasms that can have similar clinical presentations and overlapping histological features. Microscopic distinction is occasionally difficult because the immature lymphocytes associated with thymoma may resemble T-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma cells, morphologically and immunohistochemically. An accurate diagnosis assumes particular importance since the treatment approaches for these two entities differ considerably. Multimodality diagnostic approaches incorporating histological, flow cytometry immunophenotypic' and molecular approaches are required. In this article, we describe four patients, each presenting with a mediastinal tumour in different clinicopathological settings. A detailed report of each case will follow, illustrating the challenges involved in the diagnosis in patients with these mediastinal neoplasms.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Kuwait Cancer Center, Kuwait, Kuwait.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA njain@mdanderson.org jkhoury@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA njain@mdanderson.org jkhoury@mdanderson.org.']",,20181122,,,,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"BH3 mimetics are novel targeted drugs with remarkable specificity, potency and enormous potential to improve cancer therapy. However, acquired resistance is an emerging problem. We report the rapid development of resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells isolated from patients exposed to increasing doses of navitoclax (ABT-263), a BH3 mimetic. To mimic such rapid development of chemoresistance, we developed simple resistance models to three different BH3 mimetics, targeting BCL-2 (ABT-199), BCL-XL (A-1331852) or MCL-1 (A-1210477), in relevant hematologic cancer cell lines. In these models, resistance could not be attributed to either consistent changes in expression levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins or interactions among different pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. Using genetic silencing, pharmacological inhibition and metabolic supplementation, we found that targeting glutamine uptake and its downstream signaling pathways, namely glutaminolysis, reductive carboxylation, lipogenesis, cholesterogenesis and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling resulted in marked sensitization of the chemoresistant cells to BH3 mimetic-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings highlight the possibility of repurposing widely used drugs, such as statins, to target intermediary metabolism and improve the efficacy of BH3 mimetic therapy.","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, Leicester Cancer Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester Royal Infirmary, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK svar@liverpool.ac.uk.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK.']",,20181122,,,['MC_U132670597/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,PMC6518917,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"The aim of this study was to investigate long-term outcome following first-line therapy in consecutive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients in a well-defined geographic area: Sweden. All patients diagnosed with CLL (2007-2013) (n=3672) were identified from national registries, screening of patient files identified all (100%) treated first line (n=1053) and for those, an in-depth analysis was performed. End points were overall response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Median age was 71 years; 53% had Rai stage III-IV and 97% had performance status grade 0-2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in 57% of patients: 15% had del(17p). Chlorambucil + prednisone was used in 39% (5% also received rituximab). Fludarabine+cyclophosphamide+rituximab or fludarabine+cyclophosphamide was used in 43% and bendamustine + rituximab in 6%. Overall response rate was 64%; chlorambucil 43%, fludarabine+cyclophosphamide+rituximab 84%, fludarabine+cyclophosphamide 75% and bendamustine + rituximab 75%. Median PFS and OS was 24 and 58 months, respectively, both were significantly associated (multivariate analysis) with type of treatment, del(17p), performance status, gender, age and geographical region (OS only). Chlorambucil-treated patients had a median PFS and OS of only 9 and 33 months, respectively. Chlorambucil usage declined gradually throughout the study period, but one-third of patients still received chlorambucil + rituximab in 2013. Infections >/=grade III were significantly associated with treatment; chlorambucil 19% versus fludarabine+cyclophosphamide+rituximab 30%. Richter transformation occurred in 5.5% of the patients, equally distributed across therapies. This is the largest retrospective, real-world cohort of consecutive first-line treated CLL patients with a complete follow up.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"CD147 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with multiple functions in human healthy tissues and diseases, in particular in cancer. Overexpression of CD147 correlates with biological functions that promote tumor progression and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast to solid tumors, the role of CD147 has not been extensively studied in leukemia. Understanding whether CD147 represents a new hematologic target and whether its inhibitor AC-73 may be used in leukemia therapy may reveal an alternative treatment strategy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed CD147 expression and function in hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal cord blood, in several leukemic cell lines and in primary leukemic blasts obtained from patients with AML. We investigated the effects of AC-73, used alone or in combination with arabinosylcytosine (Ara-C) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), on leukemic cell proliferation. We demonstrated that CD147 overexpression promotes leukemic cell proliferation. We showed that AC-73 exhibits a potent growth inhibitory activity in leukemic cells, by inhibiting the ERK/STAT3 activation pathway and activating autophagy. We demonstrated that AC-73 exerts an anti-proliferative effect additive to chemotherapy by enhancing leukemic cell sensitivity to Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity or to ATO-induced autophagy. We also reported CD147 expression in the fraction of leukemic blasts expressing CD371, a marker of leukemic stem cells. Altogether, our study indicates CD147 as a novel potential target in the treatment of AML and AC-73 as an anti-proliferative drug and an inducer of autophagy in leukemic cells to use in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.","['National Center for Drug Research and Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome.', 'National Center for Drug Research and Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome.', 'National Center for Drug Research and Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome.', 'Core Facilities, Istituto Superiore di Sanita.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita.', 'National Center for Drug Research and Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome catherine.labbaye@iss.it.']",,20181122,,,,,PMC6518905,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"Asparaginase-associated pancreatitis is a life-threatening toxicity to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. To elucidate genetic predisposition and asparaginase-associated pancreatitis pathogenesis, ten trial groups contributed remission samples from patients aged 1.0-17.9 years treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia between 2000 and 2016. Cases (n=244) were defined by the presence of at least two of the following criteria: (i) abdominal pain; (ii) levels of pancreatic enzymes >/=3 x upper normal limit; and (iii) imaging compatible with pancreatitis. Controls (n=1320) completed intended asparaginase therapy, with 78% receiving >/=8 injections of pegylated-asparaginase, without developing asparaginase-associated pancreatitis. rs62228256 on 20q13.2 showed the strongest association with the development of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (odds ratio=3.75; P=5.2x10(-8)). Moreover, rs13228878 (OR=0.61; P=7.1x10(-6)) and rs10273639 (OR=0.62; P=1.1x10(-5)) on 7q34 showed significant association with the risk of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis. A Dana Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium cohort consisting of patients treated on protocols between 1987 and 2004 (controls=285, cases=33), and the Children's Oncology Group AALL0232 cohort (controls=2653, cases=76) were available as replication cohorts for the 20q13.2 and 7q34 variants, respectively. While rs62228256 was not validated as a risk factor (P=0.77), both rs13228878 (P=0.03) and rs10273639 (P=0.04) were. rs13228878 and rs10273639 are in high linkage disequilibrium (r(2)=0.94) and associated with elevated expression of the PRSS1 gene, which encodes for trypsinogen, and are known risk variants for alcohol-associated and sporadic pancreatitis in adults. Intra-pancreatic trypsinogen cleavage to proteolytic trypsin induces autodigestion and pancreatitis. In conclusion, this study finds a shared genetic predisposition between asparaginase-associated pancreatitis and non-asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, and targeting the trypsinogen activation pathway may enable identification of effective interventions for asparaginase-associated pancreatitis.","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center and Department of Pharmacology, University of Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St Anna Children's Hospital and Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria."", ""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah-Tikva, Israel and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Ospedale San Gerardo, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'University Medical Center Eppendorf, Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center and Department of Pharmacology, University of Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Maine Children's Cancer Program, Scarborough, ME, USA."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Department of Pediatrics, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague and Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'University Hospital Motol, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark Kjeld.Schmiegelow@regionh.dk.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,20181122,,,"['R00 ES023504/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 ES025052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6395330,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,['Ponte di Legno toxicity working group'],,,,,,,

However, the influence of contributing factors such as mouse strain, cell of origin and Cre recombinase copy number are unknown. In this study, we compared RBP-J deletion efficiency using one versus two copies of Cre recombinase. Further, we compared the incidence and timing of leukemia development in two unique strains of mice, C57BL/6 and 129/SV, as well as at different B-cell developmental stages. We found that animals expressing two copies of Cre recombinase developed B-cell leukemia at an earlier age and with more fulminant disease, compared with control animals and animals expressing one copy of Cre recombinase. In addition, we found a difference in leukemia incidence between C57BL/6 and 129/SV mouse strains. Whereas deletion of RBP-J in renin-expressing cells of C57BL/6 mice leads to the development of B-cell leukemia, 129/SV mice develop dermatitis with a reactive, myeloproliferative phenotype. The difference in phenotypes is explained, in part, by the differential expression of extra-renal renin; C57BL/6 mice have more renin-expressing cells within hematopoietic tissues. Finally, we found that deletion of RBP-J in Mb1- or CD19-expressing B lymphocytes does not result in leukemia development. Together, these studies establish that renin progenitors are vulnerable cells for neoplastic transformation and emphasize the importance of genetic background on the development of inflammatory and malignant conditions.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, MR4 Building, 409 Lane Road, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA bcb9e@virginia.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, MR4 Building, 409 Lane Road, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, MR4 Building, 409 Lane Road, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, MR4 Building, 409 Lane Road, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6007-7892'],20181218,,,"['K08 DK102914/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 DK096373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK091330/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066242/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6307899,['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],['(c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Sep 17.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the most common life-threatening diseases worldwide; many patients develop multidrug resistance after treatment with anticancer drugs. The main mechanism leading to multidrug resistance is the overexpression of ABC transporters in cancer cells. Chemosensitizers are needed to inhibit the activity of ABC transporters, resulting in higer intracellular concentration of anticancer drugs. Some secondary metabolites have been reported to be chemosensitizers by inhibiting ABC transporters. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), tannic acid, and curcumin were employed in this study. Different assays were used to detect whether they have the ability to inhibit P-gp activity and overcome multidrug resistance in cancer cells overexpressing P-gp. Hypothesis/Purpose: CEM/ADR 5000 and Caco-2 cell lines, which overexpress P-gp, are multidrug resistant cell lines. We first detected whether the combination of polyphenols (EGCG, tannic acid, curcumin) and doxorubicin, an anticancer drug, is synergistic or not. To further understand the potential mechanism, EGCG, tannic acid, and curcumin were tested to check whether they have the ability to inhibit P-gp activity. When P-gp activity is inhibited, the intracellular concentration of doxorubicin is higher, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. STUDY DESIGN: The P-gp overexpressing human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 and human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM/ADR 5000 were used in this study. Two-drug combinations (doxorubicin+polyphenol) and three-drug combinations (doxorubicin+polyphenol+digitonin) were tested to examine potential synergism. The potential mechanism leading to synergism would be the inhibition of P-gp activity. A Rhodamine 123 assay and Calcein-AM assay in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR 5000, respectively, were used to detect P-gp inhibition by EGCG, curcumin, and tannic acid. METHODS: MTT assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, polyphenols and digitonin alone, and then their combinations. Furthermore, Rhodamine 123 and Calcein-AM were used to detect the effects of polyphenols on the activity of P-gp. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that a combination of non-toxic concentrations of each polyphenol with doxorubicin synergistically sensitized Caco-2 and CEM/ADR 5000 cells. Furthermore, three-drug combinations (doxorubicin+polyphenol+digitonin) were much more effective. In addition, the activity of P-gp in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR 5000 cells was measured. Consistent with the combination results, tannic acid and curcumin decreased the activity of P-gp both in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR 5000. EGCG, which weakly affected the activity of P-gp in CEM/ADR 5000, only had an effect on P-gp under higher concentration in Caco-2 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results show that EGCG, curcumin, and tannic acid, when combined with doxorubicin, can exert synergism, mediated by a reduced activity of P-gp. This study suggests that polyphenols, by modulating the activity of P-gp, may be used as chemosensitisers.","['Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Epub 2018 Nov 2.,"Although dose intensi fi cation strategies achieve a favorable prognosis for pediatric patients of T-lmphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL/ALL), numerous side effects have been followed. Molecular targeted therapies will be needed to optimize the current treatment strategy for T-LBL/ALL. The aim of this study was to analyse expression and significance of CD47, PD1 and PDL1 in. T-LBL/ALL. We performed immunohistochemistry staining and real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) on FFPE tissues. Immunohistochemistry results showed that the high expression rate of CD47 protein was 46.4% (26/56) and the positive expression rate of PDL1 protein was 37.5% (21/56). PD1 expression was observed in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in approximately 20% of T-LBL/ALL patients, but not expressed on tumor cells of T-LBL/ALL. And the results of qRT-PCR showed that the relative expression levels of CD47, PDL1 and PD1 mRNA in 56 cases of T LBL/ALL were significantly higher than those in control group (6.915 vs 4.050, 12.255 vs 2.575, 37.990 vs 3.615), and the differences were all statistically significant (p all <0.05). Univariate analysis showed that age, CD47 protein, CD47 mRNA,PDL1 protein and PDL1 mRNA expression were closely correlated with prognosis (P all <0.05). We found that the overall one-year survival rates of patients with a high expression (>/=M) of CD47 and PDL1 mRNA were higher than in patients with low expression (<M). However, the overall one-year survival rate of patients with a high expression (>/=M) of CD47 and PDL1 protein were lower than in patients with low expression (<M). And patients with </=25 years old had a worse prognosis than with >25 years old. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the high expression of CD47 and PDL1 protein were independent prognostic factors (both p < 0.05). In a word, PD1/PDL1 and CD47 may be involved in the disease progression and prognosis of T-LBL/ALL, and detection and targeting of CD47 and PD1/PDL1 may provide a rational basis to for treatment of T-LBL/ALL.","['Department of Pathology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China.

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"Whether and when to recommend an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for a patient with leukemia is a treatment decision that rests on determining whether the transplant or non-transplant option carries the greatest probability of 3-5-year survival. While SCT confers a greater possibility of leukemia cure, the decision to transplant has to be made in the light of the high chance of treatment-related mortality (TRM) that follows the allograft. Here we identify that current estimates of a 20% 3-year TRM hold largely true for a variety of leukemias, diverse types of conditioning regimen, and varied donor-recipient compatibility across a wide age-range. While there is a wide spectrum of causes of death in the first few months after SCT, they usually stem from a limited set of immediate post-transplant complications, including those induced by the conditioning regimen, post-transplant endovascular damage, gut dysbiosis, graft-versus-host disease, and immunodeficiency causing viral reactivation. As we better understand and improve preventative treatments for these initiating events there is a real expectation that TRM will continue to fall to levels well below 10% within the next decade.","['Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Program, GW Cancer Center, George Washington University, Medical Faculty Associates, 2150 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20037, USA.

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"Germline syndromes in myeloid leukemias are being discovered increasingly in patients, and their identification is essential for proper medical management to yield positive health outcomes for patients and their families. There needs to be a greater appreciation of germline predisposition driving the development of hematologic malignancies within the field of myeloid malignancies. Characterization of the influence of germline mutations on the development of myeloid malignancies is ongoing by utilization of next generation sequencing data and prognostic panels. Here, we propose modifications to the utilization and analysis of genetic results, specifically to have a high index of clinical suspicion for germline predisposition, to use assays that are comprehensive for detection of these variants, and a few caveats to interpreting sequencing data. Presented are the benefits and shortcomings of prognostic panels and clinical examples of the utilization of the prognostic panel used within the Department of Pathology at The University of Chicago. The examples demonstrate that panels performed for prognostication on DNA derived from malignant cells are able to identify patients with germline syndromes, but they can lack coverage for genes that confer inherited susceptibility. Furthermore, the panels are often not designed to find duplication and deletion mutations, which calls for a need to improve assay design and bioinformatic approaches to interpret such variants using these data.","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Chicago, 5841 S.

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"Survival rates in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have markedly improved during the past decade. The one-size-fits-all-ages approach has been replaced with adaptation of pediatric-inspired treatment protocols for younger adults. Yet different treatment strategies for older patients are needed due to chemotherapy-related toxicities. A new era of immunotherapy has arrived, offering opportunities for targeted treatments for ALL subtypes. While CD20 targeting with rituximab has been demonstrated to improve survival when combined with chemotherapy, it has little activity as a single agent in ALL. In contrast, antibody targeting of CD19 and CD22 with blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin, respectively, has had remarkable single-agent activity in the relapsed setting. Studies are now underway to test these agents in combination with chemotherapy in the frontline setting. The goal of these studies is to improve event-free survival and overall survival by using these approaches in the frontline to eradicate minimal residual disease and, particularly in older adults with ALL, to reduce treatment-related toxicity by limiting the exposure to traditional multi-agent chemotherapy with its attendant toxicities. This review focuses on new immunotherapeutic treatment options and strategies for frontline treatment, including a brief discussion of the use of true immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, for relapsed B-cell ALL, the potential for targeting CD38 in T-cell ALL, and how these approaches are facilitating the next steps to improve survival for adult patients with ALL.","['Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory and Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, 900 E. 57th Street, 8th Floor Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory and Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, 900 E. 57th Street, 8th Floor Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

Epub 2018 Sep 20.,"Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) was associated with dismal survival without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Recent evidence has demonstrated that the combination of TKI and chemotherapy can result in a high rate of complete remission, thereby enabling more patients to proceed to allo-HSCT. However, with more studies reporting non-inferior outcomes with TKI and chemotherapy combination without allo-HSCT, the need for allo-HSCT in Ph+ ALL has become less certain. This review summarizes evidence that will address the relevance of allo-HSCT in Ph+ ALL.","['Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplant, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st Street South West, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Epub 2018 Sep 20.,"Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL), or BCR-ABL1-like ALL, is a high-risk subtype of B-cell precursor ALL characterized by a gene expression profile similar to Ph-positive ALL, a high frequency of IKZF1 alterations, and poor outcome. The prevalence of Ph-like ALL is common among all ages, ranging from 10% to 15% in children to over 25% in young adults. Patients with Ph-like ALL harbor a diverse range of genetic alterations that activate cytokine receptor and kinase signaling and can be targeted with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The majority of Ph-like ALL alterations are divided into two main groups based on activation of ABL-class or JAK-STAT alterations. Accordingly, preclinical studies and anecdotal reports suggest patients harboring ABL-class fusions are candidates for ABL1-inhibitors, whilst alterations activating the JAK-STAT pathway may be amenable to treatment with JAK inhibitors. Diagnostic screening approaches and precision medicine trials are now being developed and implemented to test the efficacy of targeted therapy with a backbone of chemotherapy, similar to the treatment of Ph-positive ALL.","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS342, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.

Epub 2018 Oct 23.,"Transformation of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) into secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) is defined by an arbitrary boundary of >/=20% bone marrow blasts but does not necessarily reflect a defined biological transition. The more obvious distinction lies between MDS patients that have an isolated bone marrow failure phenotype and those with excess blasts. Subtyping of MDS might be more accurately stratified into clonal cytopenias and oligoblastic leukemias, using the degree of dysplasia and blast percentage as risk features, respectively, rather than as diagnostic criteria. Transformation from MDS to sAML often involves clonal evolution or expansion of existing subclones that can be assessed by changes in variant allele frequencies of the somatic mutations that define them. There are a number of predictors for transformation that have been identified: these include mutations of genes in growth signaling pathways (NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, FLT3), mutations in genes more commonly observed in AML (NPM1, WT1, IDH2), certain cytogenetic abnormalities (monosomy 7, complex karyotype, loss of 17p). Gene expression profiles that divide MDS into two major categories identify a progenitor gene signature subtype associated with a high risk of AML transformation. Assessing for these genetic abnormalities may better identify MDS patients at greatest risk of transformation.","['UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, San Diego, CA, 92093, USA.

PURPOSE: Isolate and identify cytotoxic compounds from P. sepium and investigate the effects and mechanism of action on different cancer cell lines. METHODS: Extracts obtained with solvents of different polarities of the root bark of P. sepium were tested for their anti-proliferative effects. The most active extract was subjected to activity-guided fractionation using different chromatographic methods. The most active compound was further investigated on sarcoma cell lines regarding its effects concerning apoptosis, DNA damage and death receptor expression. RESULTS: We isolated the cardiac glycosides periplocin, glucosyl divostroside, periplogenin, periplocymarin and periplocoside M with periplocin exhibiting the lowest IC50 value against leukemia and liposarcoma cells. Liposarcomas are rare tumors within the heterogeneous group of soft tissue sarcomas and respond poorly to conventional treatments. Periplocin led to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by changing the expression of death receptors and inducing DNA double strand breaks in SW-872 cells. CONCLUSION: Periplocin displays a promising mechanism of action in sarcoma cells because altering the death receptor expression is an interesting target in sarcoma treatment especially to overcome TRAIL resistance.","['Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 5, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Graz, Universitaetsplatz 4/1, 8010 Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 5, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 5, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 5, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 5, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Biomedical Research, Medical University Graz, Roseggerweg 48, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Graz, Schubertstr. 1, 8010 Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Graz, Universitaetsplatz 4/1, 8010 Graz, Austria.

Abnormal expression of lncRNAs has also been linked to different human diseases including cancers, yet the regulatory mechanisms and functional effects of lncRNAs are still ambiguous, and the molecular details also need to be confirmed. Unlike protein-coding gene, it is much more challenging to unravel the roles of lncRNAs owing to their unique and complex features such as functional diversity and low conservation among species, which greatly hamper their experimental characterization. In this review, we summarize and discuss both conventional and advanced approaches for the identification and functional characterization of lncRNAs related to hematological malignancies. In particular, the utility and advancement of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system as gene-editing tools are envisioned to facilitate the molecular dissection of lncRNAs via different knock-in/out strategies. Besides experimental considerations specific to lncRNAs, the roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of leukemia are also highlighted in the review.

Oral targeted SACT are, however, associated with toxicities, which might result in reduced quality of life and non-adherence. To reduce treatment-related toxicity, the practice of non-standard dosing is increasing; however guidance to govern this practice is limited. A systematic review was conducted to identify evidence of, and outcomes from, non-standard dosing of oral SACT in oncology and malignant haematology. METHODS: A comprehensive search of 78 oral SACT was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE(R), EMBASE(R), Cochrane Library(c), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL(c)). Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and were critically appraised. Extracted data were tabulated to summarise key findings. Due to diversity of study designs and heterogeneity of reported outcomes, studies were categorised and evidence was synthesised in three main themes: dose interruption; dose reduction; and other dosing strategies. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were eligible for inclusion: four clinical trials, fifteen cohort studies and fifteen case reports. Evidence for non-standard dosing was reported for eleven oral SACT. Dose interruptions were the most commonly reported strategy (14 studies); nine studies reported dose reductions; and eleven reported other dosing strategies. Eight retrospective cohort studies reported dose interruption of sunitinib in renal cell carcinoma and showed either similar or improved responses and survival outcomes, and fewer or equivalent high grade toxicities, compared to the standard schedule. Four cohort studies retrospectively evaluated dose reductions of imatinib, gefitinib or erlotinib, for chronic myeloid leukaemia and non-small cell lung cancer, respectively. Other dosing strategies included alternate-day dosing. The quality of the evidence was limited by the small sample size in many studies, retrospective study designs, and lack of reported toxicity and/or QoL outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified limited evidence to support current non-standard dosing strategies, but some of findings, e.g. dose interruption of sunitinib, warrant further investigation in large-scale prospective clinical trials.","['Oxford Cancer and Haematology Centre & NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Old Road, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK. faouzi.djebbari@ouh.nhs.uk.', 'Oxford Cancer and Haematology Centre & Oxford Cancer Research Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Old Road, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK.', 'Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Marston Road, Oxford, OX3 0FL, UK.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9578-7632'],20181122,,,,,PMC6249819,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a multitude of approaches to design, perform, and report flow cytometric MRD. Together with the long-term experience needed, this makes flow cytometric MRD in AML nonstandardized and time-consuming. Areas covered: This paper briefly summarizes critical issues, like sample preparation and transport, markers and fluorochromes of choice, but in particular focuses on the main issues, which includes specificity and sensitivity, hereby providing a new model that may circumvent the main disadvantages of the present approaches. New approaches that may add to the value of flow cytometric MRD includes assessment of leukemia stem cells, MRD in peripheral blood, and approaches to use multidimensional image analysis. Expert commentary: MRD in AML requires standardization/harmonization on many aspects, for which the present paper offers possible guidelines.","['a Department of Hematology , VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , Netherlands.', 'a Department of Hematology , VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , Netherlands.', 'a Department of Hematology , VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , Netherlands.', 'a Department of Hematology , VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer is a rare but leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Established risk factors, accounting for <10% of incidence, have been identified primarily from case-control studies. However, recall, selection and other potential biases impact interpretations particularly, for modest associations. A consortium of pregnancy and birth cohorts (I4C) was established to utilise prospective, pre-diagnostic exposure assessments and biological samples. METHODS: Eligibility criteria, follow-up methods and identification of paediatric cancer cases are described for cohorts currently participating or planning future participation. Also described are exposure assessments, harmonisation methods, biological samples potentially available for I4C research, the role of the I4C data and biospecimen coordinating centres and statistical approaches used in the pooled analyses. RESULTS: Currently, six cohorts recruited over six decades (1950s-2000s) contribute data on 388 120 mother-child pairs. Nine new cohorts from seven countries are anticipated to contribute data on 627 500 additional projected mother-child pairs within 5 years. Harmonised data currently includes over 20 ""core"" variables, with notable variability in mother/child characteristics within and across cohorts, reflecting in part, secular changes in pregnancy and birth characteristics over the decades. CONCLUSIONS: The I4C is the first cohort consortium to have published findings on paediatric cancer using harmonised variables across six pregnancy/birth cohorts. Projected increases in sample size, expanding sources of exposure data (eg, linkages to environmental and administrative databases), incorporation of biological measures to clarify exposures and underlying molecular mechanisms and forthcoming joint efforts to complement case-control studies offer the potential for breakthroughs in paediatric cancer aetiologic research.","[""Population Epidemiology, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Population Epidemiology, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Braun School of Public Health, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Centre for Fetal Programming, Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Epigenetics Group, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', 'Epigenetics Group, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Centre for Fertility and Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Fertility and Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Centre for Fetal Programming, Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', ""Population Epidemiology, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Villejuif, France.', 'Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Villejuif, France.', 'Vanderbilt Institute for Global Health, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'College for Public Health and Social Justice, Saint Louis University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', ""Division of the Birth Cohort Study, Department of Woman and Child Health Care, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Institute of Environmental Medicine, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Boldrini Children's Center, Campinas, Brazil."", 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, Health Sciences, York University, York, UK.', ""Population Epidemiology, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Division of the Birth Cohort Study, Department of Woman and Child Health Care, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Nuffield Department of Women's and Reproductive Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."", 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5154-6658', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1248-229X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1687-5587']",20181122,,['Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2019 Mar;33(2):181.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Among different molecular candidates, there is growing data to support that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a significant role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HOXA-AS2 is significantly overexpressed in a variety of tumors and associated with anti-cancer drug resistance, however, little is known regarding the expression and function of HOXA-AS2 in the chemoresistance of AML. In this study, we aimed to determine the role and molecular mechanism of HOXA-AS2 in adriamycin-based chemotherapy resistance in AML cells. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect HOXA-AS2 expression in the BM samples and ADR cell lines, U/A and T/A cells. Furthermore, the effects of HOXA-AS2 silencing on cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed in vitro by CCK8 and flow cytometry, and on tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, bioinformatics online programs predicted and luciferase reporter assay were used to validate the association of HOXA-AS2 and miR-520c-3p in AML. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that HOXA-AS2 is significantly upregulated in BM samples from AML patients after treatment with adriamycin-based chemotherapy and in U/A and T/A cells. Knockdown of HOXA-AS2 inhibited ADR cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and promoted apoptosis. Bioinformatics online programs predicted that HOXA-AS2 sponge miR-520c-3p at 3'-UTR with complementary binding sites, which was validated using luciferase reporter assay and anti-Ago2 RIP assay. HOXA-AS2 could negatively regulate the expression of miR-520c-3p in ADR cells. S100A4 was predicted as a downstream target of miR-520c-3p, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HOXA-AS2 plays an important role in the resistance of AML cells to adriamycin. Thus, HOXA-AS2 may represent a therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to adriamycin-based chemotherapy in AML.","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou Academy of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Chinajiajun.l@163.com.']",,20181122,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Nov 19.,"The medicinal fungus Ganoderma, known in Chinese as Lingzhi or Reishi, traditionally has various medicinal uses and has been employed in cancer treatment in Asia for centuries. This study used ethanol-extracted Ganoderma tsugae (GT) and examined its antitumor activities on human chronic myeloid leukemia cells as well as its molecular mechanism of action. Treatment with GT (200-400mug/mL) significantly reduced cell viability and caused G2/M arrest in K562cells. In addition, GT induced mitochondrial and death receptor mediated apoptosis, correlated with DNA fragmentation, followed by cytochrome c release, caspase-3/8/9 activation, PARP cleavage, Fas activation, Bid cleavage, and Bax/Bcl-2 dysregulation. Cytoprotective autophagy was found to be induced by GT, as was revealed by increased LC3-II accumulation, Beclin-1/Bcl-2 dysregulation, acidic vesicular organelle formation, and p62/SQSTM1 activation. Notably, pretreatment of cells with the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and CQ enhanced GT-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species production in cells was not triggered by GT administration; equally, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine was found to be incapable of preventing apoptosis and autophagy induced by GT treatment. Finally, this study discovered that cytoprotective autophagy induced by GT was associated with EGFR and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade suppression.

Epub 2019 Jan 7.,"OBJECTIVE: Relapse following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is still linked to a poor prognosis. Mainly, donor`s T-cells mediate the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is an inhibitory molecule which down-regulates T-cell activation. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CTLA-4 may have an effect on immune response. METHODS: Eighty-eight children with acute leukemia and their donors were genotyped of CTLA-4 gene for rs231775. We searched for an association of CTLA-4 SNP with relapse and survival after allogeneic HSCT. RESULTS: We identified a significantly reduced relapse rate in children who received a transplant from a donor with the CTLA-4 genotypes AG or GG in comparison with genotype AA of rs231775 (19% vs 40%, P = 0.026). In addition, we observed a significant difference in event-free survival (EFS) depending on the donor s genotype. The EFS was 70% or 46% if the patient was transplanted from a donor with CTLA-4 genotype AG/GG or AA, respectively (P = 0.025). In multivariate analysis, CTLA-4 genotype was an independent risk factor for relapse rate (P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that CTLA-4 polymorphism rs231775 is relevant for relapse and survival after allogeneic HSCT in childhood and should be further investigated in clinical trials.","['Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine Il, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.']",,20190107,,,['Jose Carreras DGHO Promotionsstipendium/Jose Carreras Leukamie Stiftung'],,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In recent years, advances in leukemia research encompass the discovery of novel targets in acute myeloid leukemia drug resistance, epigenetic crosstalk in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) leukemogenesis, genetic mechanisms of aggressive NK-cell leukemia, as well as the critical role of key epigenetic regulator in acute myeloid malignancy. Remarkably, researchers revealed that the histone modifying gene SETD2 as a new tumor suppressor and therapeutic target in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, low-dose chemotherapy as a frontline regiment in treating pediatric acute myeloid leukemia can substantially reduce the toxic side effects and treatment costs without impairing efficacy. Although advances in cancer genomics have greatly increased our understanding of the molecular characteristics in tumor biology, recent studies suggest that Darwinian evolution of intratumor heterogeneity represents a major challenge to develop therapeutic strategies to improve disease control. Researchers also dissected the distinct evolutionary dynamics under different chemotherapy regimens and the corresponding applications in the evaluation of treatment outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was the characterization of the biological activity of novel benzofurans (influence on apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinases and on the cell cycle). Cellular protein(s) targeted by test benzofurans and mechanism of action were identified. METHODS: The methods utilized in the study were chemical synthesis, fluorescence assays, flow cytometry, gene expression by DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR, western blotting, cytotoxicity assays, pull-down assay, mass spectroscopy, in vitro polymerization of tubulin, molecular docking. RESULTS: 1,1'-[3-(bromomethyl)-5,6- dimethoxy-1-benzofuran-2,7-diyldiethanone (1) and methyl 4-bromo-6- (dibromoacetyl)-5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-carboxylate (2) induced apoptosis in K562 and MOLT-4 cells. The profiling of gene expression revealed that 1 and 2 increased the expression of proapoptotic genes involved in both receptor (TNFRSF 10A, TNFRSF 10B, CASP8) and mitochondrial (BAX, BID, NOXA, APAF1) pathways of apoptosis. Test benzo[b]furans activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase in K562 cells. Tubulin was identified as a protein target for benzo[b]furans in pull-down experiments with biotinylated 2. Test benzo[b]furans inhibited polymerization of tubulin monomers in vitro, decreased the level of cellular microtubules and arrested cells in a G2/M phase. Molecular docking suggests that benzo[b]furans 1 and 2 bind to tubulin via colchicine binding pocket and the complex is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions. CONCLUSION: Novel benzo[b]furans with anti-microtubule activity were identified. They induce apoptosis in cancer cells and cause G2/M cell cycle arrest. Biological activity of 1 and 2 makes them potential lead compounds for development as anticancer drugs.","['Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Medical University of Warsaw, 3 Oczki Str., 02-007 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Genetic Diagnostics and Nutrigenomics, Chair of Clinical Biochemistry, The Jagiellonian University, Medical College, 15 Kopernika Str., 31- 501 Krakow, Poland.', 'Department for Genetic Research and Nutrigenomics, The Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology Jagiellonian University, 7 Gronostajowa Str., 30-387 Krakow, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: THP-1 cells (a human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monocytic leukemia patient) were induced to differentiate THP-1 macrophages by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and were injected with 0 (blank control), 0.5, or 1.0 mug.mL(-)(1) Pg-LPS. The THP-1 cells were then grouped in accordance with incubation time, and each group was incubated for 4, 6, 12, or 24 h. The expression of the TREM-1 mRNA in macrophages was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the expression of TREM-1 protein was detected by Western blot; the site where TREM-1 protein expression was observed in macrophages was detected by immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of soluble sTREM-1 and TNF-alpha in cell culture medium was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Compared with the blank control group, the expression of TREM-1 mRNA, TREM-1 protein, and sTREM-1 in Pg-LPS-stimulated macrophages was significantly upregulated (P<0.05). The expression of TREM-1 mRNA, TREM-1 protein, and sTREM-1 in the supernatant of cell culture was higher in the 1.0 mug.mL(-)(1) Pg-LPS group than in the 0.5 mug.mL(-)(1) group; this expression was statistically significant since the 6, 4, and 4 h time point (P<0.05). Cell immunofluorescence staining showed that TREM-1 protein was positive when the THP-1 macrophages was stimulated by Pg-LPS (1.0 mug.mL(-)(1)) for 24 h, and the staining sites of TREM-1 were mainly located in the cell membrane of the macrophages (P<0.05). The expression level of TNF-alpha increased in groups stimulated by Pg-LPS, and the expression level of TNF-alpha was significantly higher in 1.0 mug.mL(-)(1) Pg-LPS stimulated groups than in 0.5 mug.mL(-)(1) Pg-LPS-stimulated groups since the 6 h time point (P<0.05). The expressions of TREM-1 mRNA, TREM-1 protein, and sTREM-1 in 0.5 mug.mL(-)(1) Pg-LPS-stimulated macrophages were positively correlated with one another (r=1, P<0.05), but no statistically significant correlation was found in the expression of TNF-alpha. The positive correlation between sTREM-1 and TNF-alpha expressions was detected when macrophages were stimulated by 1.0 mug.mL(-)(1) Pg-LPS (r=1, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of TREM-1 mRNA, TREM-1 protein, and sTREM-1 in the culture supernatant in Pg-LPS-stimulated macrophages was significantly upregulated on the basis of the concentration of Pg-LPS; moreover, their upregulation was positively correlated with one another. The expression of TNF-alpha in the supernatant of cell culture was also upregulated and was positively correlated with the expression of sTREM-1 at the group of high Pg-LPS concentration (1.0 mug.mL(-)(1)). Results reveal that TREM-1, which has been realized as a proinflammatory receptor protein, can promote the development of periodontitis by regulating the expression of TNF-alpha in macrophages.","['State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Dept. of Periodontology, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Dept. of Stomatology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Dept. of Periodontology, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Dept. of Periodontology, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Dept. of Periodontology, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",,,,,,,PMC7041144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As mediators of intercellular communication, they are involved in multiple physiological processes, but they are also associated with the pathogenesis of human malignancies including leukemia. Isolation of exosomes enables the characterization of their role in microenvironment modulation as well as their participation in disease pathology. A variety of strategies and techniques exists to purify exosomes from many biological fluids (e.g., blood, urine, and saliva). Here, we describe the efficient production of large quantities of exosomes from leukemic cell lines by using CELLine bioreactors based on two-compartment technology, as well as their isolation and purification by combining differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation through a density gradient (17% OptiPrep() cushion). Thus, exosomes are appropriately prepared for characterization by western blotting to detect exosome markers or imaging flow cytometry (ImageStream), and for downstream analyses such as the internalization in microenvironmental cells by confocal imaging or flow cytometry, methods which are also described in this chapter.","['Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'National Cytometry Platform, Department of Infection and Immunity, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg. jerome.paggetti@lih.lu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"PURPOSE: The fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene on chromosome 16q12.2 shows an intimate association with obesity and body mass index. Recently, research into the FTO gene and its expression product has attracted widespread interest due to the identification of FTO as an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase. FTO primarily regulates the m6A levels of downstream targets via their 3' untranslated regions. FTO not only plays a critical role in obesity-related diseases but also is involved in the occurrence, development and prognosis of many types of cancer, such as acute myeloid leukaemia, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Currently, studies indicate that FTO is a crucial component of m6A modification, it regulates cancer stem cell function, and promotes the growth, self-renewal and metastasis of cancer cells. In this review, we summarized and analysed the data regarding the structural features and biological functions of FTO as well as its association with different cancers and possible molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the related literatures regarding FTO and its demethylation activity in many pathologic and physiological processes, especially in cancer-related diseases based on PubMed databases in this article. RESULTS: Mounting evidence indicated that FTO plays a critical role in occurrence, progression and treatment of various cancers, even acting as a cancer oncogene in acute myeloid leukaemia, research on which is no longer restricted to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. CONCLUSION: Considering FTO's critical role in many diseases, FTO may become a new promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases in the near future, especially for specific types of cancers, such as acute myeloid leukaemia, glioblastoma and breast cancer.","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. tdubin@jnu.edu.cn.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3429-2008'],20181121,,,"['31201028/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81872893/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '21617462/Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities', '201707010099/Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission', ""82618257/Provincial Undergraduates' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training"", 'Programs', 'A2017574/Medical Scientific Research Foundation of Guangdong Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"Pteridines are bicyclic heterocyclic compounds with a pyrazino[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus that have shown a wide range of therapeutic utilities. Concretely, 4-aminopteridine derivatives have demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, and some of them, such as methotrexate, are profusely used in medical practice. We have recently synthesized and tested the biological activity of a novel series of 4-amino-2-aryl-6,9-dichlorobenzo[g]pteridines, finding that they present anti-inflammatory properties, as they were able to inhibit in vitro the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6. Now, we have evaluated the anti-tumor potential of these compounds on HL-60 and K562 leukemia cell lines. Cells growing at exponential rate were exposed to decreasing doses of each compound, from 50 to 0.39 muM, for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell viability was tested by MTT assay and cell death fashion determined by annexin V/propidium iodide assay. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined in differentiated macrophage-like HL-60 cells and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to evaluate the potential side effects on quiescent tumor cells and normal cells, respectively. Among the series, compounds 1a, 1b, 1g, 1j, and 1k showed anti-proliferative activity. Compounds 1j and 1k were active against both HL-60 and K562 cells, with a lower IC50 against HL-60 cells. Compounds 1a, 1b, and 1g had a great cytotoxic activity against HL-60, but they were far less potent against K562 cells. None had side effects in differentiated tumor cells or in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that some compounds of this series of 4-amino-2-aryl-6,9-dichlorobenzo[g]pteridines have anti-cancer properties in vitro.","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular (B) e Inmunologia, School of Medicine, IMIB and Regional Campus of International Excellence ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", Universidad de Murcia, 30100, Murcia, Spain. ajruiz@um.es.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular (B) e Inmunologia, School of Medicine, IMIB and Regional Campus of International Excellence ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", Universidad de Murcia, 30100, Murcia, Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica, Universidad de Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, 30100, Murcia, Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Fisica, Universidad de Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, 30100, Murcia, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular (B) e Inmunologia, School of Medicine, IMIB and Regional Campus of International Excellence ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", Universidad de Murcia, 30100, Murcia, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular (B) e Inmunologia, School of Medicine, IMIB and Regional Campus of International Excellence ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", Universidad de Murcia, 30100, Murcia, Spain. pigarcia@um.es.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6913-0610'],20181121,,,"['19249/PI/14/Fundacion Seneca/International', 'EJ-2014-A-95803/Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y', 'Tecnica/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given limited research funding, allocating resources in alignment with societal burden is essential. However, evidence shows that such alignment does not typically occur. The objective of the present study was to provide an updated overview of site-specific cancer research investment in Canada and to explore potential discrepancies between the site-specific burden and the level of research investment. Methods: The 10 cancer sites with the highest mortality in 2015-which included brain, female breast, colorectal, leukemia, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, and uterus-were selected for the analysis. Information about site-specific research investment and cancer burden (raw incidence and mortality) was obtained from the Canadian Cancer Research Survey and Statistics Canada's cansim (the Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System) respectively. The ratio of site-specific research investment to site-specific burden was used as an indicator of overfunding (ratio > 1) or underfunding (ratio < 1). Results: The 3 cancer sites with the highest research investments were leukemia, prostate, and breast, which together represented 51.3% of 2015 cancer research funding. Conversely, the 3 cancer sites with the lowest investments were uterus, pancreas, and ovary, which together represented 7.8% of 2015 research funding. Relative to site-specific cancer burden, the lung, uterus, and colorectal sites were consistently the most underfunded. Conclusions: Observed discrepancies between cancer burden and research investment indicate that some cancer sites (such as lung, colorectal, and uterus) seem to be underfunded when site-specific incidence and mortality are taken into consideration.","['Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Toronto, ON.', 'Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Toronto, ON.', 'Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Toronto, ON.', 'Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Toronto, ON.', 'Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Toronto, ON.', 'Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Toronto, ON.']",,20181031,,,,,PMC6209562,"[""CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES We have read and understood Current Oncology's"", 'policy on disclosing conflicts of interest, and we declare that we have none.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated epigenetic regulation of HOTAIR and its target microRNA, miR-143, in advanced CML. Patients and methods: We first isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells from 70 patients with different phases of CML and from healthy donors as normal control; we also cultured K562 and KCL22 cells, treated with demethylation drug; MTT assay, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), Western blot, luciferase assay, RNA pull-down assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were performed. Result: As measured by qPCR, HOTAIR expression in K562 cells, KCL22 cells, and samples from cases of advanced-stage CML increased with levels of several DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylates, including DNMT1, DNMT3A, HDAC1, EZH2, and LSD1, and miR-143 levels were decreased and HOTAIR levels were increased. Treatment with 5-azacytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, decreased DNMT1, DNMT3A, HDAC1, EZH2, LSD1 mRNA, protein levels, and HOTAIR mRNA levels but increased miR-143 levels. HOTAIR knockdown and miR-143 overexpression both inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in KCL22 and K562 cells through the PI3K/AKT pathway. RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, and RIP assays showed that HOTAIR interacted with EZH2 and LSD1. A dual-luciferase assay demonstrated that HOTAIR interacted with miR-143. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the key epigenetic interactions of HOTAIR related to CML progression and suggest HOTAIR as a potential therapeutic target for advanced CML. Furthermore, our results support the use of demethylation drugs as a CML treatment strategy.","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, People's Republic of China, luojm315@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, People's Republic of China, luojm315@163.com.""]",,20181105,,,,,PMC6225916,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies investigating the impact of autoimmune diseases and infections on leukemogenesis have revealed conflicting results. If inflammation increases the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use may decrease the risk of leukemia. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of 3,053 patients with AML diagnosed between 2000 and 2013, who were registered in the Danish National Acute Leukemia Registry, and 30,530 population controls matched on sex and age. We identified prescriptions through the Danish National Health Service Prescription Database. We used conditional logistic regression analysis to compute ORs associating AML with NSAID use overall, in patients with inflammatory diseases, and for specific AML subtypes (de novo AML, AML related to previous hematological disease, ie, secondary AML [sAML], or therapy-related AML [tAML; exposed to previous cytotoxic therapy]). Results: Overall, NSAID use was not associated with a lower risk of AML (OR 1.1, 95% CI=1.0-1.2), de novo AML (OR 1.0, 95% CI=0.9-1.1), and sAML/tAML (OR 1.3, 95% CI=1.1-1.5). In addition, in patients with known inflammatory diseases, NSAIDs did not affect AML risk (OR 0.9, 95% CI=0.5-1.6). Number of prescriptions, type of NSAID, age, or sex did not influence the results. Conclusion: In line with our recent findings that showed no association between autoimmune diseases and infections and de novo AML, NSAID use was not found to reduce the risk of AML.","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, lenoestg@rm.dk.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, lenoestg@rm.dk.', 'Department of Medicine, Holstebro Regional Hospital, Holstebro, Denmark, lenoestg@rm.dk.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, lenoestg@rm.dk.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, lenoestg@rm.dk.', 'Diagnostic Center, Silkeborg Regional Hospital, Silkeborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Herlev University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Roskilde University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.']",,20181029,,,,,PMC6214335,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although abnormal expression of PANDAR has been well investigated in solid tumors, it was rarely studied in hematologic diseases. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the PANDAR expression level and its clinical significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Materials and methods: For detecting the expression level of PANDAR in 119 AML patients and 26 controls, real-time quantitative PCR was used in this study. The prognostic values were evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression analyses, and logistic regression analysis. Results: PANDAR was significantly overexpressed in AML and might be a promising biomarker which could distinguish AML from normal samples (P<0.001). Patients with high expression of PANDAR (PANDAR (high)) were older and showed higher bone marrow blasts than patients in PANDAR (low) group (P=0.029 and 0.032, respectively). Significant differences between these groups were also detected regarding risk group and karyotype finding (P=0.009 and 0.041, respectively). Importantly, PANDAR (high) patients presented a significant lower complete remission rate compared to PANDAR (low) patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that PANDAR (high) patients had shorter overall survival compared to PANDAR (low) patients observing the whole AML cohort, and also in the non-M3 group of patients (P<0.001 and P=0.005, respectively). Multivariate analysis of Cox and logistic regression analysis confirmed that high PANDAR expression was an independent unfavorable risk factor for overall survival and complete remission in both observed patient groups. Conclusion: These results revealed that PANDAR was overexpressed in AML, and that higher PANDAR expression was associated with poor clinical outcome. Our study therefore suggests that PANDAR expression is a promising biomarker for prognostic prediction for AML.","[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, yaodongming1990@163.com."", ""The Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, qianjun0007@hotmail.com, yaodongming1990@163.com.""]",,20181029,,,,,PMC6214337,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism remains elusive in renal system. Thus, in the present study, the regulatory mechanisms of CD-induced apoptosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells were investigated. Materials and methods: Cell proliferation was evaluated by colony formation assay and cell cycle analyses. Protein expressions of focal adhesion (FA) related complexes were examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses. Cell migration and invasion capabilities of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells were determined by wound healing and Transwell assays. Results: CD inhibited cell colony formations, induced cell arrest at G2/M phase, and increased subG1 cell population both in 786-O and A-498. During CD treatment, the ""rounded-up"" cells were observed. The immune-staining of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), vinculin, and paxillin displayed disassembly of the FA. Moreover, disruption of actin stress fibers was noted after CD treatment. Consistent with the findings, the expressions of pSrc, pFAK, FAK, vinculin, vimentin, and paxillin were all downregulated by CD. In addition, CD attenuated cell migration and invasion activities accompanied by the reductions of pNF-kappaB, matrix metallo-proteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 as well as vascular endothelial growth factor expressions. Conclusion: CD induced cell cycle arrest, FA complex disassembly, and the inactivation of migratory-related signaling pathways to induce apoptosis in ccRCC cells.","['Department of Urology, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, yungchia@kmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, yungchia@kmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, yungchia@kmu.edu.tw.']",,20181031,,,,,PMC6217210,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far, treatment approaches have been limited, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate chemotherapy. In this study, we report an effective treatment for such patients. Materials and methods: A 52-year-old man diagnosed with Ph-negative B-precursor ALL went into remission after inductive treatment. Unfortunately, when he subsequently relapsed, severe complications drove him to refuse intensive chemotherapy. Instead, he received a cycle of dendritic cells-cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIK) before chemotherapy. Result: The patient tolerated rituximab in combination with a vincristine, daunorubicin, l-asparaginase, and prednisone regimen without complications, and was in remission after DC-CIK infusion. After consolidation chemotherapy, including rituximab followed by eight cycles of DC-CIK, the patient has been free of leukemia for 2 years since the relapse. Conclusion: This case of relapsed ALL was successfully treated with DC-CIK combined with a rituximab regimen.","['Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China, househuang@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China, househuang@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China, househuang@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China, househuang@zju.edu.cn.']",,20181029,,,,,PMC6214580,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: Our results showed that Arminin 1a-C formed an alpha-helical structure and efficaciously suppressed the viability of leukemia cell lines whether or not they were multidrug resistant or sensitive, and there were no obvious differences between these cell lines. Arminin 1a-C exhibited distinct selectivity between noncancerous and cancerous cell lines. Arminin 1a-C interfered with K562/adriamycin (ADM) cell (a kind of multidrug-resistant leukemia cell line) proliferation in a very rapid manner and formed pores in its cell membrane, making it difficult to develop resistance against Arminin 1a-C.

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"It is now well established that tumours undergo changes in cellular metabolism(1). As this can reveal tumour cell vulnerabilities and because many tumours exhibit enhanced glucose uptake(2), we have been interested in how tumour cells respond to different forms of sugar. Here we report that the monosaccharide mannose causes growth retardation in several tumour types in vitro, and enhances cell death in response to major forms of chemotherapy. We then show that these effects also occur in vivo in mice following the oral administration of mannose, without significantly affecting the weight and health of the animals. Mechanistically, mannose is taken up by the same transporter(s) as glucose(3) but accumulates as mannose-6-phosphate in cells, and this impairs the further metabolism of glucose in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway and glycan synthesis. As a result, the administration of mannose in combination with conventional chemotherapy affects levels of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, leading to sensitization to cell death. Finally we show that susceptibility to mannose is dependent on the levels of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI). Cells with low levels of PMI are sensitive to mannose, whereas cells with high levels are resistant, but can be made sensitive by RNA-interference-mediated depletion of the enzyme. In addition, we use tissue microarrays to show that PMI levels also vary greatly between different patients and different tumour types, indicating that PMI levels could be used as a biomarker to direct the successful administration of mannose. We consider that the administration of mannose could be a simple, safe and selective therapy in the treatment of cancer, and could be applicable to multiple tumour types.","['Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Division of Genetics and Cell Biology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK. k.ryan@beatson.gla.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. k.ryan@beatson.gla.ac.uk.']",,20181121,,,"['16-1194/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'G0501974/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0601891/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using three different lectins that specifically recognize this structure, we establish that nucleolin (NCL), a protein implicated in cancer, contains 9-O-Ac-Sia. Surprisingly, antibodies against the glycolipid 9-O-Ac-Sia GD3 also detected 9-O-Ac-Sia NCL. NCL is present on the surface of pre-B ALL cells as a sialoglycoprotein that is partly 9-O-acetylated and conversely, 9-O-Ac-Sia-containing structures other than NCL are present on these cells as well. Interestingly, NCL and the 9-O-Ac-Sia signal had less co-localization on normal pre-B cells. We also investigated regulation of NCL on the cell surface and found that sialidase treatment increased the percentage of cells positive for cell surface NCL, suggesting that sialylation of NCL promotes internalization. Treatment of pre-B ALL cells with the chemotherapy drug vincristine also increased the percentage of cells with surface NCL and correlated with increased 9-O-Ac-Sia expression.

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"Mouse strains with specific deficiency of given hematopoietic lineages provide invaluable tools for understanding blood cell function in health and disease. Whereas neutrophils are dominant leukocytes in humans and mice, there are no widely useful genetic models of neutrophil deficiency in mice. In this study, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of the Mcl-1 antiapoptotic protein in Lyz2 (Cre/Cre) Mcl1 (flox/flox) (Mcl1 (DeltaMyelo)) mice leads to dramatic reduction of circulating and tissue neutrophil counts without affecting circulating lymphocyte, monocyte, or eosinophil numbers. Surprisingly, Mcl1 (DeltaMyelo) mice appeared normally, and their survival was mostly normal both under specific pathogen-free and conventional housing conditions. Mcl1 (DeltaMyelo) mice were also able to breed in homozygous form, making them highly useful for in vivo experimental studies. The functional relevance of neutropenia was confirmed by the complete protection of Mcl1 (DeltaMyelo) mice from arthritis development in the K/BxN serum-transfer model and from skin inflammation in an autoantibody-induced mouse model of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Mcl1 (DeltaMyelo) mice were also highly susceptible to systemic Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans infection, due to defective clearance of the invading pathogens. Although neutrophil-specific deletion of Mcl-1 in MRP8-CreMcl1 (flox/flox) (Mcl1 (DeltaPMN)) mice also led to severe neutropenia, those mice showed an overt wasting phenotype and strongly reduced survival and breeding, limiting their use as an experimental model of neutrophil deficiency. Taken together, our results with the Mcl1 (DeltaMyelo) mice indicate that severe neutropenia does not abrogate the viability and fertility of mice, and they provide a useful genetic mouse model for the analysis of the role of neutrophils in health and disease.","['Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Szeged, 6726 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Computer Science, Corvinus University of Budapest, 1093 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Szeged, 6726 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, 1117 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, 1117 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Office of Supported Research Groups of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 1051 Budapest, Hungary; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Szeged, 6726 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, 1094 Budapest, Hungary; mocsai.attila@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8009-139X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6839-964X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7493-9569', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6854-4301', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2224-0836']",20181121,,,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '087782/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,PMC6287103,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.'],,,['EMS80131'],,,,,,,,,

However, the growth promotion effects of metabolic reprogramming can be due to moonlighting functions of metabolic enzymes as well as the redirection of flux through particular pathways. To identify metabolic enzymes that might have potential moonlighting functions in oncogenesis, we have examined recent screens of the yeast GFP strain collection for metabolic enzymes that have been implicated in cancer metabolism with an unusual subcellular localization. Asparagine synthetase forms filaments in yeast in response to nutrient limitation and is part of a pathway that is a chemotherapy target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Interestingly, while yeast asparagine synthetase forms cytoplasmic filaments in response to nutrient stress, human asparagine synthetase is associated with the centrosomes and mitotic spindles. This localization is disrupted by both nocodazole and asparaginase treatments. This failure to localize occurs even though asparagine synthetase is highly upregulated in response to asparaginase treatment. Together, these results argue that human asparagine synthetase undergoes regulated recruitment to the mitotic spindles and that it may have acquired a second role in mitosis similar to other metabolic enzymes that contribute to metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells.","['Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, 25/25 Phuttamonthon 4 Road, Salaya, Phuttamonthon, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand chalongrat.nor@mahidol.edu.', 'Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive (MC 0347), La Jolla, CA 92093-0347, USA.', 'Center of Excellence for Medical Genomics, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7774-4281'],20181214,,,,,PMC6310878,['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],['(c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is a new pillar in cancer therapeutics; however, its application is limited by the associated toxicities. These include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Although the IL-6R antagonist tocilizumab is approved for treatment of CRS, there is no approved treatment of neurotoxicity associated with CD19-targeted CAR-T (CART19) cell therapy. Recent data suggest that monocytes and macrophages contribute to the development of CRS and neurotoxicity after CAR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we investigated neutralizing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a potential strategy to manage CART19 cell-associated toxicities. In this study, we show that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab does not inhibit CART19 cell function in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, CART19 cell proliferation was enhanced and durable control of leukemic disease was maintained better in patient-derived xenografts after GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab. In a patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft model of CRS and neuroinflammation (NI), GM-CSF neutralization resulted in a reduction of myeloid and T cell infiltration in the central nervous system and a significant reduction in NI and prevention of CRS. Finally, we generated GM-CSF-deficient CART19 cells through CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of GM-CSF during CAR-T cell manufacturing. These GM-CSF(k/o) CAR-T cells maintained normal functions and had enhanced antitumor activity in vivo, as well as improved overall survival, compared with CART19 cells. Together, these studies illuminate a novel approach to abrogate NI and CRS through GM-CSF neutralization, which may potentially enhance CAR-T cell function. Phase 2 studies with lenzilumab in combination with CART19 cell therapy are planned.","['Mayo Clinic Medical Scientist Training Program, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Humanigen, Burlingame, CA.', 'Humanigen, Burlingame, CA.', 'Humanigen, Burlingame, CA.', 'Humanigen, Burlingame, CA.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Department of Immunology.', 'Division of Hematology, and.']",,20181121,,,"['K12 CA090628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002379/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS103212/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6376281,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cases, the disease may initially be misdiagnosed as reactive arthritis, osteomyelitis, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis delaying appropriate diagnosis and management. Even if leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of nighttime pain are reported to be the most important predictive factors for a pediatric leukemia, blood examinations can sometimes be subtle or within normal limits, and this represents a further diagnostic difficulty. Radiological findings of leukemic bone involvement are described in patients with musculoskeletal symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and often appear before hematologic anomalies, but they are not specific for the disease. However, they could be helpful to get the right diagnosis if integrated with other features; thus, it is important knowing them, and it is mandatory for the multidisciplinary comparison to talk about dubious cases even in an emergency setting. We describe 4 patients visited in the emergency department for musculoskeletal complaints and having radiological lesions and a final diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in whom the onset of the manifestations could mimic orthopedic/rheumatologic diseases.","[""From the Emergency Pediatric Department, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS."", ""From the Emergency Pediatric Department, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Child Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome.', 'Departments of Radiology.', ""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""From the Emergency Pediatric Department, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS.""]",,,,,,,,['Disclosure: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],"['Copyright (c) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, we analysed CLL patients aged >/=80 years using data from seven phase III clinical trials of the German CLL Study Group. Among 3552 participants, 152 were >/=80 years old at initiation of first-line study treatment. Median age was 82 years (range 80-90). Concomitant diseases were present in 99% of the patients, with a median cumulative illness rating scale score of 8 (0-18). Chemoimmunotherapy with chlorambucil-obinutuzumab (CLB-OB) or chlorambucil-rituximab (CLB-R) was administered to 61 (40%) and 56 (37%) patients. The remaining patients received CLB (n = 19) or fludarabine (F, n = 10), F/cyclophosphamide (FC, n = 1), FC/rituximab (FCR, n = 2) or bendamustine/rituximab (BR, n = 3). Rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and infections were 35% and 13%. Overall response rate was 77% with 13% complete remissions. Median progression-free survival and treatment-free survival were 17.2 and 32.3 months, respectively. Median overall survival was 48.3 months; adverse events (22%) and progressive CLL (16.4%) were the most frequent causes of death. These findings suggest that anti-leukaemic treatment including chemoimmunotherapy is feasible and efficacious in >/=80-year-old CLL patients. However, this group of patients lives for a shorter time than age-matched controls of the general population.","['Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology, Immunology, Palliative Care, Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, German CLL Study Group, Hospital Munich-Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology, Immunology, Palliative Care, Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, German CLL Study Group, Hospital Munich-Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cologne Cluster of Excellence in Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-associated Disease (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Centre of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Oncogeriatric Unit, Department of Geriatric Medicine, St. Marien Hospital, Cologne, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9895-0570'],20181121,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 14.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has a poor prognosis derived from its genetic heterogeneity, which translates to a high chemoresistance. Recently, our workgroup designed thrombospondin-1-derived CD47 agonist peptides and demonstrated their ability to induce cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Encouraged by these promising results, we evaluated cell death induced by PKHB1 (the first-described serum-stable CD47-agonist peptide) on CEM and MOLT-4 human cell lines (T-ALL) and on one T-murine tumor lymphoblast cell-line (L5178Y-R), also assessing caspase and calcium dependency and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, we evaluated selectivity for cancer cell lines by analyzing cell death and viability of human and murine non-tumor cells after CD47 activation. In vivo, we determined that PKHB1-treatment in mice bearing the L5178Y-R cell line increased leukocyte cell count in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs while recruiting leukocytes to the tumor site. To analyze whether CD47 activation induced immunogenic cell death (ICD), we evaluated damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) exposure (calreticulin, CRT) and release (ATP, heat shock proteins 70 and 90, high-mobility group box 1, CRT). Furthermore, we gave prophylactic antitumor vaccination, determining immunological memory. Our data indicate that PKHB1 induces caspase-independent and calcium-dependent cell death in leukemic cells while sparing non-tumor murine and human cells. Moreover, our results show that PKHB1 can induce ICD in leukemic cells as it induces CRT exposure and DAMP release in vitro, and prophylactic vaccinations inhibit tumor establishment in vivo.

Epub 2018 Nov 20.,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess a short-duration JPRESS protocol for detection of overlapping metabolite biomarkers and its application to paediatric brain tumours at 3 Tesla. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The short-duration protocol (6 min) was optimised and compared for spectral quality to a high-resolution (38 min) JPRESS protocol in a phantom and five healthy volunteers. The 6-min JPRESS was acquired from four paediatric brain tumours and compared with short-TE PRESS. RESULTS: Metabolite identification between the 6- and 38-min protocols was comparable in phantom and volunteer data. For metabolites with Cramer-Rao lower bounds > 50%, interpretation of JPRESS increased confidence in assignment of lactate, myo-Inositol and scyllo-Inositol. JPRESS also showed promise for the detection of glycine and taurine in paediatric brain tumours when compared to short-TE MRS. CONCLUSION: A 6-min JPRESS protocol is well tolerated in paediatric brain tumour patients. Visual inspection of a 6-min JPRESS spectrum enables identification of a range of metabolite biomarkers of clinical interest.","['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', ""Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', ""Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', ""Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK."", 'Institute of Digital Healthcare, WMG, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.', ""Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK."", 'Centre for Human Brain Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK. a.peet@bham.ac.uk.', ""Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK. a.peet@bham.ac.uk."", 'Clinical Research Block, Institute of Child Health, Whittall Street, Birmingham, B4 6NH, UK. a.peet@bham.ac.uk.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1783-412X'],20181120,,,"['G0601327/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', ""BCHRF287/Birmingham Children's Hospital Research Foundation"", '13-0053/National Institute for Health Research', 'NIHR-RP-02-12-019/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'C8232/A25261/Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre Paediatric Network', ""C7809/A10342/CR UK and EPSRC Cancer Imaging Programme at the Children's cancer"", 'and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) in association with the MRC and Department of Health', '(England)', 'PIIF-GA-2012-332278/EU Marie Cure: International Incoming Fellowship', '10342/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,PMC6424926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Body: By combining the target-specificity of antibodies to the effector capabilities of T cells, CARs have yielded high remission rates for many late staged and relapsed/refractory (r/r) hematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Despite toxicities of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, recent studies have uncovered their underlying mechanisms and devised effective therapies to manage and possibly prevent them. In 2017, CAR T cell therapy became a reality for the general public despite the high costs, when Novartis's Kymriah, became the first product to receive FDA approval for pediatric r/r B cell ALL with Gilead's Yescarta following several months later. Although effective in hematological malignancies, CAR response has been limited in solid tumors largely attributed to the heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment along tumor defense mechanisms, such as antigenic escape. Conclusion: Despite the current challenges of CAR T therapy, this technology is still in its infancy and its promise will continue to grow as scientists continue to develop novel approaches to enhance its efficacy. As its prevalence continues to increase, institutions and pharmaceuticals worldwide are investing in this technology in hopes of driving therapeutic innovation, while providing greater access to their respective populations through clinical trials.","['Penn State College of Medicine, 61A University Manor East, Hershey, PA USA.0000 0004 0543 9901grid.240473.6']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9331-1857'],20181114,,,,,PMC6236896,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When present in the promoter of some oncogenes, G4 structures can affect gene regulation and, hence, represent a possible therapeutic target. In this study, RNA-Seq was used to explore the effect of a G4-binding anthraquinone derivative, named AQ1, on the whole-transcriptome profiles of two common cell models for the study of KIT pathways; the human mast cell leukemia (HMC1.2) and the canine mast cell tumor (C2). The highest non-cytotoxic dose of AQ1 (2 microM) resulted in 5441 and 1201 differentially expressed genes in the HMC1.2 and C2 cells, respectively. In both cell lines, major pathways such as cell cycle progression, KIT- and MYC-related pathways were negatively enriched in the AQ1-treated group, while other pathways such as p53, apoptosis and hypoxia-related were positively enriched. These findings suggest that AQ1 treatment induces a similar functional response in the human and canine cell models, and provide news insights into using dogs as a reliable translational model for studying G4-binding compounds.","['Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padua, Legnaro, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padua, Legnaro, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padua, Legnaro, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padua, Legnaro, Padua, Italy. mauro.dacasto@unipd.it.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy. claudia.sissi@unipd.it.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9713-1415'],20181120,,,"['DOR1798331/Universit&amp;#x00E0; degli Studi di Padova (University of', 'Padova)/International', 'CPDA147272/Universit&amp;#x00E0; degli Studi di Padova (University of', 'Padova)/International']",,PMC6244004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasingly, these biological insights are pointing the way toward novel therapeutic approaches. Using representative clinical case presentations, we review the key clinical, pathologic, and epidemiologic features of infant leukemia, including the high frequency of KMT2A gene rearrangements. We describe the current approach to risk-stratified treatment of infant leukemia in the major international cooperative groups. We highlight recent discoveries that elucidate the molecular biology of infant leukemia and suggest novel targeted therapeutic strategies, including modulation of aberrant epigenetic programs, inhibition of signaling pathways, and immunotherapeutics. Finally, we underscore the need for increased global collaboration to translate these discoveries into improved outcomes.","['Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Centro M.

Epub 2018 Oct 26.,"PURPOSE: ME-401 is a novel selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase p110delta, an enzyme often found overexpressed and overactive in B-cell malignancies. The current study was performed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending oral doses of ME-401 in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This analysis was an open-label, nonrandomized study in healthy male volunteers. Three sequential groups were dosed. Each group received single doses of ME-401 on two occasions; the doses tested ranged from 10 to 150 mg. Blood was drawn at various time points to analyze plasma concentrations of ME-401 and inhibition of basophil activation, a marker of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase p110delta inhibition. FINDINGS: Fifteen subjects received a single dose of ME-401 on two occasions. Three adverse events that were considered possibly related to the study drug were reported: one event of pain, one event of headache, and one event of upper abdominal pain. ME-401 exhibited dose proportionality up to 60 mg, and supra-proportional increases in exposure were observed above doses of 60 mg. In addition, there was a dose-proportional increase in the inhibition of basophil activation up to 60 mg. Mean t1/2 ranged from 9.36 to 29.23 hours across the dose range. A 60 mg dose of ME-401 approached 90% inhibition of basophil activation, and thereafter no further increase to the percent inhibition of basophil activation was observed for higher doses. Once-daily dosing of 60 mg ME-401 was forecasted to result in trough plasma levels exceeding the concentration needed for 90% inhibition of basophil activation. IMPLICATIONS: This first-in-human study showed that ME-401 was well tolerated after single doses up to 150 mg. Pharmacologic activity was confirmed after administration of single ascending oral doses of 10 to 150 mg. ME-401 60 mg, administered once daily, was selected as the starting dose for patient studies.

New drugs such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax have achieved great success in treating relapsed and refractory (R/R) CLL. In addition, with the development of immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells (CAR-T) therapy, a novel adoptive immune treatment, has also become more and more important in treating R/R CLL. It combines the advantages of T cells and B cells via ex vivo gene transfer technology and is able to bind targets recognized by specific antibodies without antigen presentation, thus breaking the restriction of major histocompatibility complex. So far, there have been lots of studies exploring the application of CAR-T therapy in CLL. In this review, we describe the structure of chimeric antigen receptor, the preclinical, and clinical results of CAR-T therapy against CLL, along with its adverse events and advances in efficacy.","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@126.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@126.com.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9931-4055'],20181120,,,,,PMC6247712,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory rheumatological condition affecting older people which, prior to effective treatment, causes severe disability. Our understanding of associated comorbidities in PMR is based only on case reports or series and small cohort studies. The objective of this study is to review systematically the existing literature on the comorbidities associated with PMR. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched for original observational research from inception to November 2016. Papers containing the words 'Polymyalgia Rheumatica' OR 'Giant Cell Arteritis' OR the terms 'PMR' OR 'GCA' were included. Article titles were reviewed based on pre-defined criteria by two reviewers. Following selection for inclusion, studies were quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool and data were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 17,329 papers were reviewed and 41 were incorporated in this review, including three published after the search took place. Wide variations were found in study design, comorbidities reported and populations studied. Positive associations were found between PMR diagnosis and stroke, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, diverticular disease and hypothyroidism. Two studies reported a positive association between PMR and overall malignancy rate. Seven studies reported an association between PMR and specific types of cancer, such as leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloproliferative disease and specified solid tumours, although nine studies found either no or negative association between cancer and PMR. CONCLUSION: Quantification of the prevalence of comorbidities in PMR is important to accurately plan service provision and enable identification of cases of PMR which may be more difficult to treat. This review highlights that research into comorbidities in PMR is, overall, methodologically inadequate and does not comprehensively cover all comorbidities. Future studies should consider a range of comorbidities in patients with a validated diagnosis of PMR in representative populations.","['Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Primary Care Sciences, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, UK. r.partington@keele.ac.uk.', 'Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Primary Care Sciences, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, UK.', 'Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Primary Care Sciences, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, UK.', 'Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Primary Care Sciences, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, UK.', 'Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Primary Care Sciences, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, UK.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7362-0257'],20181120,,,['RP_2014-04-026/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,PMC6247740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the treatment of choice. However, this can only be considered after complete remission 2 (CR2) is achieved. Therefore, bridging treatment is urgently needed. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present study, we report a relapsed adult B-cell ALL case that achieved CR2 after treatment with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cell (CAR-T) therapy. After subsequent allo-HSCT, the patient acquired 21 months of disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: The present results confirm that both CAR-T and allo-HSCT are effective for treating refractory or relapsed B-ALL. However, a novel sequential treatment strategy with these two therapeutic methods may achieve longer disease-free survival time.","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, Hebei, China.', 'Hebei Senlangbio Technology Co., LTD, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China. zhxjhbmu@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Hebei Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China. wfxhebmu@163.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3365-4428'],20181120,,,['H2018206035/Nature Science Foundations of Hebei.China'],,PMC6245806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: One-hundred and sixty patients starting IgRT for HM-associated SID (myeloma: 54 cases, chronic lymphoid leukemia: 54, aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma: 19, indolent non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma: 29, and Hodgkin disease: 4. entered an observational, prospective, longitudinal study and were followed-up for 8.7 +/- 4.0 months. Seventeen patients died (five within the context of sepsis). Compared to baseline, IgRT increased serum immunoglobulin levels by 3.4 +/- 2.4 g/L and decreased frequency and severity of infections. Treatment was discontinued in 9% of patients, stopped for futility in 31%, temporally interrupted in 8%, suspended during summertime in 14% and pursued without interruption in 38% of patients.

Please clarify which one is to be followed.]) rat model for Asherman syndrome (AS). DESIGN: Basic research on treatment of AS utilizing an optimized rat model. SETTING: University research laboratories. ANIMAL(S): Sprague Dawley rat model in which AS was induced in accordance to an optimized protocol. INTERVENTION(S): Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were harvested from the rat's bone marrow and labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the second passage of BMSCs. The fifth passage of GFP-labeled BMSCs was injected systemically through the tail vein in the optimized AS rat model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We examined the reproliferation of the endometrial lining and the expression of markers for endometrium and endometrial receptivity. The localization of engrafted GFP-labeled BMSCs was determined by a laser scanning confocal microscope and a fluorescence microscope. The number of pregnant rats and implanted embryos in each uterus was recorded to evaluate the function of endometrium. RESULT(S): We had demonstrated that in the in vivo experiments on our rat model for AS, the group which received BMSC injection had significantly improved reproductive outcomes-70% of these rats conceived, whereas none of the rats in the control group got pregnant ( P < .01, chi(2) test). The mean number of embryos undergoing implantation was 14 +/- 1.24 in the sham group and 7 +/- 5.70 in the BMSC group (Levene test, P = .001). There was no significant difference between the groups from the time of coitus to conception. To further determine how BMSC injection could have resulted in the improved reproductive outcomes in rats with AS, we employed immunohistochemical techniques to examine the endometrium of these treated rats. On hematoxylin-eosin staining, we noted the reproliferation of all layers of the endometrium and with Masson staining, we noted significant reduction in fibrosis in the damaged endometrium of rats treated with BMSCs. Counterstaining for GFP and cytokeratin-positive cells was noted in the endometrial lining of treated rats, which might suggest the action of BMSCs in regenerating the damaged endometrial lining. The expression of the endometrial receptivity marker, Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in this regenerated endometrial lining could have resulted in the improved reproductive outcomes observed in the AS rat model treated with BMSCs. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were likely to play an important role in the reconstruction of the injured endometrium and improvement of reproductive outcomes in the optimized AS rat model.","['1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, National University Health Systems, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Lufen Gao and Zhongwei Huang are considered joint co-first authors for this study.', '2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, National University Health Systems, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Lufen Gao and Zhongwei Huang are considered joint co-first authors for this study.', '3 Department of Orthopaedics, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Nanfang Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '4 School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '4 School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '5 Institute of Clinical Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', ""6 College of Clinical Medicine, Guadong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",,20181120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 20.,"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Voriconazole (VCZ) and posaconazole (PCZ) remain the most widely used antifungals for the prophylaxis and treatment of IFD. However, VCZ and PCZ are liable for drug-drug interactions and show a pharmacokinetic variability that requires therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Isavuconazole (IVZ) is a newest generation triazole antifungal approved for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in adult patients and for the treatment of invasive mucormycosis in adult patients for whom treatment with amphotericin B is inappropriate. In clinical trials, IVZ showed linear pharmacokinetics and little or no evidence for interactions with other drugs. There is only modest evidence on IVZ pharmacokinetics and TDM in real-life settings. Here, we report on IVZ pharmacokinetics in a young adult with Ph chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed a ""probable"" IA during induction chemotherapy. The patient was initially treated with VCZ, but she developed a severe hepatic toxicity that was associated to the high plasma levels of VCZ. Therefore, VCZ was discontinued and the patient was switched to IVZ. After a loading dose of IVZ, the patient remained on IVZ for 5 months while also receiving standard maintenance chemotherapy for ALL. At day 65 after the start of IVZ, the patient experienced a significant hepatic toxicity; however, no change in IVZ plasma concentrations was observed in the face of a concomitant administration of many other drugs (cancer drugs, antiemetics, other anti-infectives). Hepatic toxicity resolved after discontinuing maintenance chemotherapy but not IVZ. These results show that (i) IVZ plasma concentrations remained stable throughout and were not affected by concomitant ALL therapy, and (ii) there was no relation between IVZ plasma concentration and hepatic toxicity. Thus, in clinical practice IVZ may not require TDM.","['Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Medicine, Center for Integrated Research and Unit of Drug Sciences, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for Integrated Research and Unit of Drug Sciences, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Unit, University Hospital Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Unit, University Hospital Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy, p.menna@unicampus.it.']",,20181120,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 S.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) are rare BCR-ABL1 fusion gene-negative myeloid neoplasms with a predominance of neutrophils. Since no standard therapeutic strategy currently exists for these diseases, we retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for aCML and CNL. Data from 14 aCML and 5 CNL patients as their diagnoses were collected using a nationwide survey. Allo-HSCT was performed between 2003 and 2014. Preconditioning regimens included myeloablative (n = 15), reduced-intensity (n = 3), and non-myeloablative (n = 1) regimens. Transplanted stem cells were obtained from HLA-matched related donors (n = 5) and alternative donors (n = 14). Neutrophil engraftment was successfully achieved in 17 patients. One-year overall survival rates (OS) were 54.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.8 to 76.7%) and 40.0% (95% CI, 5.2 to 75.3%) in patients with aCML and CNL, respectively. Among aCML patients, 1-year OS were 76.2% (95% CI, 33.2 to 93.5%) and 20.0% (95% CI, 0.8 to 58.2%) in patients with <5% myeloblasts (n = 9) and >/=5% myeloblasts (n = 5) in peripheral blood before allo-HSCT, respectively. These results suggest that allo-HSCT achieves long-term survival in patients with aCML and CNL. Better pre-transplant management is required to improve the outcomes of aCML patients with >/=5% blasts in peripheral blood.","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.

Epub 2018 Nov 17.,"Cortactin is a cytoskeletal-remodeling adaptor protein, playing an oncogenic role in solid tumors. Little is known on cortactin expression in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (B-NHLs). The present study aimed to characterize cortactin expression in B-NHLs and to assess its role in the differential diagnosis of such entities. Cortactin protein expression was first assessed by immunohistochemistry in a series of 131 B-NHLs, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 17), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n = 16), follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 25), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL; n = 30), hairy cell leukemia (HCL; n = 10), splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphomas (SDRPBL; n = 3), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 30) cases. Cortactin was expressed in 14 of 17 CLLs, 10 of 10 HCLs, and 22 of 30 DLBCLs. MCLs, SDRPBLs, most FLs, and MZLs were cortactin negative. The immunohistochemical results were in keeping with in silico gene expression data. In CLL, cortactin positivity did correlate with LEF1 and CD200 expression, and the combined positivity for >/=2 markers strongly predicted CLL diagnosis. Such preliminary data suggested a role for cortactin in the differential diagnosis between CLL and MCL. This hypothesis was confirmed in a large validation set of 112 CLLs (n = 55) and MCLs (n = 57), which also disclosed rare cortactin-expressing MCLs. The immunohistochemical and gene expression results were sustained by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis on CLL and MCL cell lines. In conclusion, cortactin is mainly expressed in subsets of CLL and DLBCL and in HCL. Cortactin may represent a novel marker for the differential diagnosis between CLL and MCL.","['General Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, 35121 Italy.

Epub 2018 Nov 19.,"Targeted therapy with small molecules directed at essential survival pathways in leukemia represents a major advance, including the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K) p110delta inhibitor idelalisib. Here, we found that genetic inactivation of p110delta (p110deltaD910A/D910A) in the Emu-TCL1 murine chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) model impaired B cell receptor signaling and B cell migration, and significantly delayed leukemia pathogenesis. Regardless of TCL1 expression, p110delta inactivation led to rectal prolapse in mice resembling autoimmune colitis in patients receiving idelalisib. Moreover, we showed that p110delta inactivation in the microenvironment protected against CLL and acute myeloid leukemia. After receiving higher numbers of TCL1 leukemia cells, half of p110deltaD910A/D910A mice spontaneously recovered from high disease burden and resisted leukemia rechallenge. Despite disease resistance, p110deltaD910A/D910A mice exhibited compromised CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response, and depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells restored leukemia. Interestingly, p110deltaD910A/D910A mice showed significantly impaired Treg expansion that associated with disease clearance. Reconstitution of p110deltaD910A/D910A mice with p110deltaWT/WT Tregs reversed leukemia resistance. Our findings suggest that p110delta inhibitors may have direct antileukemic and indirect immune-activating effects, further supporting that p110delta blockade may have a broader immune-modulatory role in types of leukemia that are not sensitive to p110delta inhibition.","['Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Program, and.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Janssen Research and Development LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.']",,20181119,,,"['R01 CA159296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA225070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6307940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, treatment approaches to induce complete donor chimerism and MRD negativity can lead to complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and marrow aplasia. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive characterization of the molecular remission status after transplantation. Methods We analyzed 764 samples from 70 patients after HSCT for the simultaneous measurement of chimerism and molecular targets used for MRD testing with a digital PCR (dPCR) platform. Results Mixed chimerism (MC) was detected in 219 samples from 37 patients. The mean percentage of host derived DNA in these clinical samples was 4.3%. Molecular relapse with a positive MRD marker and/or increased WT1 expression was observed in 15 patients. In addition to WT1 overexpression, other MRD positive markers were: NPM1 (Type A, B, K), DNMT3A (R882H), MLL-PTD, IDH1 (R132H) and KRAS (G12S). Increasing MC was observed in 15 patients. This group of patients showed either a positive MRD marker, increased WT1 expression or both. Next, we analyzed whether MC or the molecular target for MRD was first detected.

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,"Genetic mutations in the phosphatase PTPN11 (SHP2) are associated with childhood leukemias. These mutations cause hyperactivation of SHP2 due to the disruption of the autoinhibitory conformation. By targeting the activation-associated protein conformational change, we have identified an SHP2 inhibitor ( E)-1-(1-(5-(3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)acryloyl)-2-ethoxy-4-hydroxybenzyl)-1,2,5,6-tet rahydropyridin-3-yl)-1 H-benzo[ d]imidazol-2(3 H)-one (LY6, 1) using computer-aided drug design database screening combined with cell-based assays. This compound inhibited SHP2 with an IC50 value of 9.8 muM, 7-fold more selective for SHP2 than the highly related SHP1. Fluorescence titration, thermal shift, and microscale thermophoresis quantitative binding assays confirmed its direct binding to SHP2. This compound was further verified to effectively inhibit SHP2-mediated cell signaling and proliferation. Furthermore, mouse and patient leukemia cells with PTPN11 activating mutations were more sensitive to this inhibitor than wild-type cells. This small molecule SHP2 inhibitor has a potential to serve as a lead compound for further optimization studies to develop novel anti-SHP2 therapeutic agents.","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , Georgia 30322 , United States."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center , Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio 44106 , United States.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , Georgia 30322 , United States."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center , Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio 44106 , United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center , Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio 44106 , United States.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , Georgia 30322 , United States."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center , Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio 44106 , United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , Georgia 30322 , United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology , University of California, San Francisco , San Francisco , California 94122 , United States.', 'School of Pharmacy , Anhui Medical University , Hefei 230032 , China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , Georgia 30322 , United States.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , Georgia 30322 , United States."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center , Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio 44106 , United States.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4256-8652'],20181205,,,['R21 HD087760/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6467801,,,,,['NIHMS1012602'],,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the best transplant strategy, we retrospectively compared autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT), related (MSD), and fully matched unrelated (MUD) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). We identified 256 adult patients including 125 auto-SCT, 72 MSD, and 59 MUD. The 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 62% in auto-SCT, 69% in MUD, and 81% in MSD (P = .02 for MSD vs others). The 2-year overall survival (OS) was not different among auto-SCT, MUD, and MSD, reaching 83% (P = .88). The 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 2.5% in auto-SCT and 7.5% in allo-SCT (P = .04). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (RI) was higher after auto-SCT (30%) than after MUD (22%) and MSD (12%, P = .01). In multivariate analysis, MSD versus auto-SCT but not MUD versus auto-SCT was associated with lower RI (P < .01 and P = .13, respectively) and better LFS (P = .01 and P = .31, respectively). Age correlated with higher NRM (P < .01). Allo-SCT using MSD appears as a reasonable transplant option for young patients with iNPM1m AML in CR1. Auto-SCT was followed by worse RI and LFS, but similar OS to both allo-SCT modalities.","['Section of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli Calmette, Marseille, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli Calmette, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Hopital Jean Minjoz, Service d'Hematologie, Besancon, France."", 'CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-leveque, Pessac, France.', 'University of Milan, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'CHRU, Service des Maladies du Sang, Angers, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli Calmette, Marseille, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1897-0227', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6204-977X']",20181210,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we aimed to study the role and mechanism of Dex in cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and apoptosis. First, I/R injury models were established. Six groups were assigned after different treatments: sham, I/R, I/R+Dex, I/R+2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) (HIF-1alpha inhibitor), I/R+CoCl 2 (HIF-1alpha activator), and I/R+Dex+CoCl 2 groups. Neurological function, cerebral infarction volume, survival, and apoptosis of brain cells were then analyzed. Besides, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of HIF-1alpha, BCL-2[B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2] adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL2[B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2] associated X (Bax), and cleaved-caspase3 proteins in brain tissues. I/R rats showed cerebral infarction, increased neurological function score, number of terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and HIF-1alpha-positive cells as well as decreased neurons. Inhibition of HIF-1alpha can reduce the apoptosis induced by I/R, and overexpression of HIF-1alpha can aggravate apoptosis in brain tissue of I/R rats.

A semisynthetic HHT has been approved for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In addition to antileukemic activity, HT and HHT are reported to possess potent antiviral activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of HT and HHT on replication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in vitro. HT and HHT, but not their biologically inactive parental alkaloid cephalotaxine (CET), significantly inhibited replication of recombinant VZV-pOka luciferase. Furthermore, HT and HHT, but not CET, strongly induced down-regulation of VZV lytic genes and exerted potent antiviral effects against a VZV clinical isolate. The collective data support the utility of HT and HHT as effective antiviral candidates for treatment of VZV-associated diseases.","['Department of Life Science, Gachon University, Seongnam, 13120, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Gachon University, Seongnam, 13120, Republic of Korea. songyj@gachon.ac.kr.']",,20181119,,,,,PMC7090801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 20.,"PURPOSE: Veliparib is an oral inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme. Combination of veliparib and temozolomide was well-tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity in older patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or AML arising from pre-existing myeloid malignancies. We aimed to perform quantitative assessments of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of veliparib in this patient population to inform future trial design. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using Phoenix((R)) NLME with pharmacokinetic data obtained from 37 subjects after oral administration of veliparib in a Phase I study with and without temozolomide. Effect of covariates (age, sex, BMI, creatinine clearance (CLCR), and co-administration of temozolomide) on the pharmacokinetics of veliparib were evaluated, as well as impact of veliparib exposure on mucositis (dose-limiting toxicity), objective response rate (ORR), and overall survival. RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order elimination and a first-order absorption with lag-time adequately described veliparib pharmacokinetics. CLCR and body weight were clinically significant covariates for veliparib disposition. The proportion of subjects with all grade mucositis increased with veliparib exposure (AUC). However, no trend in ORR and overall survival was observed with increasing exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Veliparib with temozolomide presents a promising combination for older patients with myeloid leukemias. An exposure-safety relationship was established for this combination. Further clinical investigations aimed at elucidating the veliparib exposure-efficacy/safety relationship and optimizing dosing recommendations for maximizing benefit-risk in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies should study veliparib doses ranging up to 120 mg in combination with temozolomide.","['Center for Translational Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Translational Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Translational Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA. mgopalakrishnan@rx.umaryland.edu.', 'The Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Investigational Drug Branch, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Investigational Drug Branch, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Center for Translational Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. beumerj@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2881-9870'],20181120,,,"['UM1 CA186716/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA070095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA099168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001079/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186690/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA047904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6404524,,,,,['NIHMS1010213'],,['ETCTN-6745 study team'],,,,,,,

This applies in particular to cancer initiation, where model constraints have precluded investigations of immunosurveillance and immunoediting during the multistep progression into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we used a mouse model where the chimeric transcription factor MLL-ENL can be conditionally activated in vivo as a leukemic ""first-hit,"" which is followed by spontaneous transformation into AML. We observed similar disease kinetics regardless of whether AML developed in WT or immunocompromised hosts, despite more permissive preleukemic environments in the latter. When assessing transformed AML cells from either primary immunocompetent or immunocompromised hosts, AML cells from all sources could be targets of endogenous immunity. Our data argue against immunoediting in response to selective pressure from endogenous immunity as a universal primary transformation event in AML.","['Division of Molecular Hematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Centre, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8761-4237'],20180710,,,,,PMC6238415,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in next generation sequencing have revealed molecular landscape of AML, presenting us with many molecular abnormalities. The individual prognostic information derived from a specific mutation could be modified by other molecular lesions. Therefore, the genomic complexity in AML poses a huge challenge to successful translation into more accurate risk stratification and targeted therapy.

Epub 2018 Nov 19.,"Ibrutinib plus venetoclax is a highly effective combination in mantle cell lymphoma. However, strategies to enable the evaluation of therapeutic response are required. Our prospective analyses of patients within the AIM study revealed genomic profiles that clearly dichotomized responders and nonresponders. Mutations in ATM were present in most patients who achieved a complete response, while chromosome 9p21.1-p24.3 loss and/or mutations in components of the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodeling complex were present in all patients with primary resistance and two-thirds of patients with relapsed disease. Circulating tumor DNA analysis revealed that these alterations could be dynamically monitored, providing concurrent information on treatment response and tumor evolution. Functional modeling demonstrated that compromise of the SWI-SNF complex facilitated transcriptional upregulation of BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) providing a selective advantage against ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Together these data highlight important insights into the molecular basis of therapeutic response and provide a model for real-time assessment of innovative targeted therapies.","['Peter MacCallum

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of silencing the leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein1 (LRG1) gene, which was found to regulate tumor proliferation and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plasmid interference technique was used to silence the LRG1 gene in the KASUMI-1 cell line. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to test the effect of transduction on cell viability. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were applied to detect the expression levels of proteins and mRNA, respectively. RESULTS KASUMI-1 cells with the CD34(+)CD38(-) phenotype were sorted by flow cytometry. After transfection of the siLRG1 plasmid, the level of LRG1 expression was downregulated and cell viability was reduced. Silencing of LRG1 gene blocked KASUMI-1 cells in G0/G1 phase and promoted apoptosis. Further experiments found that LRG1 gene silencing significantly downregulated cell cycle-associated proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins, while upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins. Downregulation of LRG1 gene expression also inhibits signal transduction of the JAK-STAT pathway. CONCLUSIONS LRG1 gene silencing regulates the expression of cyclin and apoptosis-related proteins to reduce cell viability and promote apoptosis, probably through inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway.","[""Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland).""]",,20181120,,,,,PMC6256841,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absence of minimal residual disease (MRD) following induction chemotherapy is associated with an excellent prognosis.

We analyzed 104 paired samples of NPM1 (mut) AML patients with relapse and identified 14/104 that relapsed with NPM1 (wt) AML. Blood counts at diagnosis differed significantly between patients with NPM1 (mut) and NPM1 (wt) relapse (median white blood cell count, 30 vs 3 x 10(9)/L, P = .008; platelet count, 66 vs 128 x 10(9)/l, P = .018). NPM1 (mut) relapse occurred significantly earlier than NPM1 (wt) relapse (14 vs 43 months, P = .004). At diagnosis, FLT3-ITD were more frequent in patients with NPM1 (mut) relapse (P = .029), whereas DNMT3A mutations were more frequent in patients with NPM1 (wt) relapse (P = .035). Sequencing analysis of paired samples at diagnosis, molecular remission, and NPM1 (wt) relapse identified cooccurring mutations that persist from diagnosis throughout remission and at relapse, suggestive of a preexisting clonal hematopoiesis.

In 121 WM patients treated between 1993 and 2016, we analyzed the prognostic role during the clinical course of the initial International Prognostic Scoring System for WM (IPSSWM). Then, we assessed onset of response, progression, and second treatment initiation coded as time-dependent covariates. High-risk IPSSWM was an adverse prognostic factor for survival after first treatment initiation (SAFTI). Nevertheless, the corresponding Dxy concordance index obtained in multiple landmark analyses decreased from 0.24 to 0.08 during the first 6 years, in accordance with a departure from the proportional hazard assumption. By contrast with onset of response (whatever its level), onset of progression and initiation of second-line treatment retained prognostic value for SAFTI (P = .02 and P = .006, respectively). These findings were confirmed in cause-specific Cox models for deaths related to WM, but not for unrelated deaths. Time to progression after first-line treatment and time to initiation of second-line treatment had no prognostic value for survival after these 2 events. These results were confirmed in an independent series of 119 patients homogeneously treated with chemoimmunotherapy. Finally, after second-line and third-line treatment, onset of progression had significant prognostic value for subsequent risk of related death only. Thus, taking initial IPSSWM and delayed response to treatment into account, only onset of progression and second treatment initiation provided additional prognostic information for SAFTI. Therefore, progression-free survival or time to next treatment may be satisfactory surrogate end points of SAFTI in WM.","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Schaffner, Lens, France."", ""Department of Biostatistics, Equipe d'accueil 2694-Sante publique: epidemiologie et qualite des soins, University of Lille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France."", ""Department of Biostatistics, Equipe d'accueil 2694-Sante publique: epidemiologie et qualite des soins, University of Lille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Institut Universitaire Cancerologie Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France; and."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Schaffner, Lens, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Schaffner, Lens, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Institut Universitaire Cancerologie Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France; and."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Schaffner, Lens, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Schaffner, Lens, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France."", ""Department of Biostatistics, Equipe d'accueil 2694-Sante publique: epidemiologie et qualite des soins, University of Lille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Schaffner, Lens, France."", ""Department of Biostatistics, Equipe d'accueil 2694-Sante publique: epidemiologie et qualite des soins, University of Lille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.""]",,,,,,,PMC6258926,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,['French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO) CLL group'],,,,,,,

Caring for children with ALL is challenging for parents. A mobile health (mHealth) supportive care intervention was developed to meet parents' needs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the potential effectiveness of this mHealth supportive care intervention on emotional distress, social support, care burden, uncertainty in illness, quality of life, and knowledge. METHODS: We conducted a quasi-experimental pre- and postdesign study from June 2015 to January 2016. In total, 101 parents were enrolled in the study, with 50 in the observation group and 51 in the intervention group. Parents in the observation group received the standard health education and were observed for 3 months. Parents in the intervention group received the mHealth supportive care intervention, in addition to the standard health education. The intervention consisted of 2 parts-an Android smartphone app ""Care Assistant (CA)"" and a WeChat Official Account. The CA with 8 modules (Personal Information, Treatment Tracking, Family Care, Financial and Social Assistance, Knowledge Center, Self- Assessment Questionnaires, Interactive Platform, and Reminders) was the main intervention tool, whereas the WeChat Official Account was supplementary to update information and realize interaction between parents and health care providers. Data of parents' social support, anxiety, depression, care burden, uncertainty in illness, quality of life, their existing knowledge of ALL and care, and knowledge need were collected before and after the 3-month study period in both groups. For the intervention group, parents' experience of receiving the intervention was also collected through individual interviews. RESULTS: Overall, 43 parents in the observation group and 49 in the intervention group completed the study. Results found that the intervention reduced parents' anxiety (Dint(Post-Pre)=-7.0 [SD 13.1], Dobs(Post-Pre)=-0.4 [SD 15.8], t90=-2.200, P=.03) and uncertainty in illness (Dint(Post-Pre)=-25.0 [SD 8.2], Dobs(Post-Pre)=-19.8 [SD 10.1], t90=-2.761, P=.01), improved parents' social function (Dint(Post-Pre)=9.0 [SD 32.8], Dobs(Post-Pre)=-7.5 [SD 30.3], t90=2.494, P=.01), increased parents' knowledge of ALL and care (Dint(Post-Pre)=28.4 [SD 12.4], Dobs(Post-Pre)=17.2 [SD 11.9], t90=4.407, P<.001), and decreased their need for knowledge (Dint(Post-Pre)=-9.9 [SD 11.6], Dobs(Post-Pre)=-1.9 [SD 6.4], t90=-4.112, P<.001). Qualitative results showed that parents were satisfied with the intervention and their role in the caregiving process. CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth intervention in supporting parents of children with ALL is effective. This study is informative for other future studies on providing mHealth supportive care for parents of children with cancer.","['School of Nursing, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Faculty of Nursing, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Nursing, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai, China."", 'School of Nursing, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Nursing, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Infectious Disease, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'United States Census Bureau, Washington, DC, United States.', 'School of Nursing, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1028-177X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0683-8715', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7643-4364', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1306-4893', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2197-3875', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1209-8004', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3381-9405', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3575-3913', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7182-9356', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8480-2569']",20181119,,['JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Feb 20;7(2):e13159.

Epub 2018 Nov 17.,"Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, has been well documented to act directly on immune cells and malignant cells. Activated T cells are one of the best characterized targets of calcitriol, with effects including decreasing inflammatory cytokine output and promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine production. However, the effects of calcitriol on natural killer (NK) cells are less clear. Reports suggest that only immature NK cell populations are affected by calcitriol treatment resulting in impaired cytotoxic function and cytokine production, while mature NK cells may have little or no response. NK cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (NK-LGLL) is a rare leukemia with CD3-CD16+CD56+NK cell clonal expansion. The current standard treatments are immunosuppressant therapies, which are not curative. The Janus kinase (JAK) - signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is hyperactivated in LGLL and is one pathway of interest in new drug target investigations. We previously demonstrated the ability of calcitriol to decrease STAT1 tyrosine 701 (p-STAT1) and STAT3 tyrosine 705 (p-STAT3) phosphorylation as well as inflammatory cytokine output of T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia cells, but did not determine the effects of calcitriol on NK-LGLL. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether NKL cells, a model of NK-LGLL, and NK-LGLL patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are susceptible to treatment with calcitriol or seocalcitol (EB1089), a potent analog of calcitriol. NKL cells are dependent on interleukin (IL)-2 for survival and we show here for the first time that treatment with IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 through 6. Both calcitriol and EB1089 caused significant upregulation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). IL-2 induction of p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 phosphorylation was significantly decreased after calcitriol or EB1089 treatment. Additionally, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) extracellular output was significantly decreased at 100nMEB1089 and intracellular IL-10 was decreased with either calcitriol or EB1089 treatment. We treated NK-LGLL patient PBMCs with calcitriol or EB1089 and found decreased p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 while VDR increased, which matched the NKL cell line data. We then measured 75 serum cytokines in NK-LGLL patients (n=8) vs. age- and sex-matched normal healthy donors (n=8), which is the first serum cytokine study for this LGLL subtype. We identified 15 cytokines, including IL-10 and Flt-3L, which were significantly different between normal donors and NK-LGLL patients. Overall, our results suggest that activating the vitamin D pathway could be a mechanism to decrease STAT1 and 3 activation and inflammatory cytokine output in NK-LGLL patients.","['University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap) is a tick-transmitted obligate intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of the granulocytic anaplasmosis in various species of domestic animals and in humans. During intracellular development Ap transforms from a dense-cored cell form into a reticulate cell form and vice versa. For isolation of intracellular bacteria, a range of different purification methods is used. However, unlike other Gram-negative bacteria Ap is considered to be sensitive to mechanical stress and osmolarity changes. An updated semi-purification method using rock tumbler grit is introduced here to increase the outcome of bacteria and to facilitate the procedure of host cell lysis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the structural integrity and infectivity of Ap after lysis of the host cells using rock tumbler grit and to compare the outcome to that of the frequently used method, syringe lysis. Human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines (HL-60) were infected with Ap and following host cell-free bacteria were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. The outcome of the different purification methods was compared using live/dead-staining based on immunofluorescence to count the number of viable bacteria and real-time PCR to compare the amount of DNA. Subsequently the isolated bacteria were tested to infect naive cell cultures. We observed that both Ap dense-cored cells and reticulate cells are preserved intact after the application of rock tumbler grit. The number of viable, host cell-free bacteria was higher by factor 1.7-2.4 compared to the syringe lysis protocol. Quantitative analysis based on real-time PCR showed an increase of bacterial DNA up to 1.6-2.9 times higher using the rock tumbler grit protocol. Bacteria released from the same number of infected host cells were used for new infections. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cultures confirmed that the number of Ap organisms recovered by using the rock tumbler grit protocol resulted in higher infection rates than the number of Ap organisms recovered by using syringe lysis protocol. Our observations indicate that the rock tumbler grit protocol can be applied as a safe, robust and convenient method to recover Ap compared to syringe lysis.","['Institute for Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Department of Veterinary Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, LMU Munich, Veterinaerstr. 13, 80539, Munich, Germany.

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"Globally, vaccines are used to prevent and control the menace of infectious diseases in livestock with some reported to be inadvertently contaminated with extraneous agents (EAs). With the aim of screening and characterizing for some selected EAs, 44 live viral poultry vaccines were randomly selected based on availability. The vaccines comprised 14 manufacturers in 10 different countries including Nigeria were screened by Polymerase Chain Reaction. In 9% (4/44) of the vaccines, contamination with only avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroup J (ALV-J) was recorded. Other exogenous ALV subgroups, chicken infectious anemia and infectious laryngotracheitis viruses were absent. The EAs was found in infectious bursal disease (n=1), Fowlpox (n=2) and Mareks disease (n=1) vaccines. Phylogenetic analysis of the ALV-J env gene showed clustering with contemporary group I and II. The result underscores the importance of screening vaccines to avoid the introduction and spread of EAs that could pose a threat to poultry production.","['National Veterinary Research Institute, PMB 01, Vom, Nigeria.

METHODS: Flow cytometry were used to assess the in vitro effect of compound kushen injection (CKI). Quantitative proteomics were used to analyse the mechanism. The AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model were used to evaluate the in vivo effect of CKI. RESULTS: We found that intracellular ROS levels in AML cells were decreased, the antioxidant capacity were increased when treated with CKI. CKI inhibited the proliferation of AML cells and enhanced the cytotoxicity of AML cells, which has few toxic effects on haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and T cells. At the single-cell level, individual AML cells died gradually by CKI treatment on optofluidic chips. CKI promoted apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at G1/G0 phase in U937 cells. Furthermore, higher peroxiredoxin-3 (Prdx3) expression levels were identified in CKI-treated U937 cells through quantitative proteomics detection. Mechanically, the expression of Prdx3 and peroxiredoxin-2 (Prdx2) was up-regulated in CKI-treated AML cells, while thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) was reduced. Laser confocal microscopy showed that the proteins Prdx2 could be Interacted with Trx1 by CKI treatment. In vivo, the survival was longer and the disease was partially alleviated by decreased CD45+ immunophenotyping in peripheral blood in the CKI-treated group in the AML PDX model. CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidant CKI possess better clinical application against AML through the Prdxs/ROS/Trx1 signalling pathway.","['Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-Structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei, China.', ""Department of Clinical Haematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004, Shaanxi, China."", 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-Structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei Province, China. zhoufuling@whu.edu.cn.']",,20181119,,,"['cxpy20160001/Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University Science, Technology and', 'Innovation Seed Fund', 'cxpy20160012/Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University Science, Technology and', 'Innovation Seed Fund', '81770179/the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) programme']",,PMC6245615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary and 3D structure analysis has been utilised in order to discover indications of antigenic pressure. The latter has been mostly based on the 3D models of the clonotypic B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) amino acid sequences. Therefore, their accuracy is directly dependent on the quality of the model construction algorithms and the specific methods used to compare the ensuing models. Thus far, reliable and robust methods that can group the IG 3D models based on their structural characteristics are missing. RESULTS: Here we propose a novel method for clustering a set of proteins based on their 3D structure focusing on 3D structures of BcR IG from a large series of patients with CLL. The method combines techniques from the areas of bioinformatics, 3D object recognition and machine learning. The clustering procedure is based on the extraction of 3D descriptors, encoding various properties of the local and global geometrical structure of the proteins. The descriptors are extracted from aligned pairs of proteins. A combination of individual 3D descriptors is also used as an additional method. The comparison of the automatically generated clusters to manual annotation by experts shows an increased accuracy when using the 3D descriptors compared to plain bioinformatics-based comparison. The accuracy is increased even more when using the combination of 3D descriptors. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results verify that the use of 3D descriptors commonly used for 3D object recognition can be effectively applied to distinguishing structural differences of proteins. The proposed approach can be applied to provide hints for the existence of structural groups in a large set of unannotated BcR IG protein files in both CLL and, by logical extension, other contexts where it is relevant to characterize BcR IG structural similarity. The method does not present any limitations in application and can be extended to other types of proteins.","['Information Technologies Institute, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, 6th km Harilaou-Thermi Road, Thessaloniki, Greece. epolyc@iti.gr.', 'Information Technologies Institute, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, 6th km Harilaou-Thermi Road, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, 6th km Harilaou-Thermi Road, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Technical University of Denmark,Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Masaryk University, Central European Institute of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

Epub 2018 Nov 19.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is one of the most fatal hematological malignancies. APL during pregnancy is a rare comorbidity and can lead to adverse outcomes, such as maternal and/or fetal death, without timely and appropriate management. Medical management for APL during pregnancy remains challenging. We reported 2 patients with no regular prenatal visits who were diagnosed with APL during pregnancy. One presented with typical hematological abnormalities related to infection, while the other presented with intracranial hemorrhage, which is rare. Although supportive measures and chemotherapy were administered after APL was diagnosed, these two patients had completely different outcomes. The pregnancy outcomes of APL patients depend greatly on the timely diagnosis and appropriate management of the disease. Physicians should pay more attention to APL during pregnancy and thus may save more maternal and fetal lives. Further study of the management of APL during pregnancy is warranted.

Epub 2018 Nov 19.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are largely responsible for tumor relapse and metastatic behavior. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) was recently reported to be a biomarker for gastrointestinal CSCs and involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression. B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1) is a crucial regulator of CSC self-renewal, malignant transformation and EMT, and a previous study from our group showed that Bmi-1 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer progression and participates in EMT. However, it remains unclear whether DCLK1 is involved in pancreatic cancer or whether DCLK1 is associated with the altered level of Bmi-1 expression. METHODS: The correlation of DCLK1 expression and clinical features of pancreatic cancer was analyzed in 210 paraffin-embedded archived pancreatic cancer specimens by immunohistochemical analysis. The biological effects of DCLK1 siRNA on cells were investigated by examining cell proliferation using a cell counting kit and cell colony assays, cell migration by wound healing assay and cell invasion by Transwell invasion assay. We further investigated the effect of therapeutic siRNA targeting DCLK1 on pancreatic cancer cell growth in vivo. Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which DCLK1 upregulates Bmi-1 expression was explored using real-time PCR, western blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: DCLK1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and is related to metastasis and prognosis. Knockdown of DCLK1 markedly suppressed cell growth in vitro and in vivo and also inhibited the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that DCLK1 silencing could inhibit EMT in cancer cells via downregulation of Bmi-1 and the mesenchymal markers Snail and Vimentin and upregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Moreover, high DCLK1 expression in human pancreatic cancer samples was associated with a mesenchymal phenotype and increased cell proliferation. Further co-immunoprecipitation indicated that DCLK1 did not interact with Bmi-1 directly. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that upregulation of DCLK1 may contribute to pancreatic cancer metastasis and poor prognosis by increasing Bmi-1 expression indirectly. The findings indicate that inhibiting DCLK1 expression might be a novel strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy.","['Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, 452 Hospital of PLA, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology and High Altitude Pathology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The Second Hospital Affiliated Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.', 'Department of Cadre Ward, 452 Hospital of PLA, Chengdu, China.', 'Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Gulliver Preparatory School, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathophysiology and High Altitude Pathology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, 452 Hospital of PLA, Chengdu, China.', 'Institute of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, Chinawhuaizhi@gmail.com.']",,20181119,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Nov 3.,"Although recent advances in chemotherapy have markedly improved outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), infantile ALL with MLL gene rearrangements (MLL+ALL) is refractory to chemotherapy. We have shown that specific cytokines FLT3 ligand and TGFbeta1 both of which are produced from bone marrow stromal cells synergistically induced MLL+ALL cells into chemo-resistant quiescence, and that treatment of MLL+ALL cells with inhibitors against FLT3 and/or TGFbeta1 receptor partially but significantly converts them toward chemo-sensitive. In the present study, we showed that MLL+ALL cells expressed CXCR4 and CXCR7, both receptors for the same chemokine stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), but their biological events were differentially regulated by the SDF-1/CXCR4 and SDF-1/CXCR7 axes and particularly exerted an opposite effect for determining chemo-sensitivity of MLL+ALL cells; enhancement via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis vs. suppression via the SDF-1/CXCR7 axis. Because cytosine-arabinoside-induced apoptosis of MLL+ALL cells was inhibited by pretreatment with the CXCR4 inhibitor but rather accelerated by pretreatment with the CXCR7 inhibitor, an application of the CXCR7 inhibitor may become a good treatment option in future for MLL+ALL patients. MLL+ALL has a unique gene profile distinguishable from other types of ALL and AML, and should be investigated separately in responses to biological active agents including chemokine inhibitors.","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.

Epub 2018 Nov 17.,"In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment induces granulocytic differentiation and maturation. MicroRNAs play pivotal roles in formation of the leukemic phenotype. Previously, microRNA-382-5p (miR-382-5p) was upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(15;17). In the present study, we found that miR-382-5p expression was elevated with ATRA-induced differentiation of APL. To investigate the potential functional role of miR-382-5p in APL differentiation, an APL cell line was transfected with miR-382-5p mimics, inhibitors, or negative control (NC). The results showed in APL cell line NB4 that miR-382-5p downregulation upon ATRA treatment was a key event in the drug response. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-382-5p targeted the ATRA-regulated tumor suppressor gene PTEN through direct binding to its 3' UTR. Enforced expression of miR-382-5p or specific PTEN inhibitors inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation via regulation of the cell cycle regulator cyclinD1. Conversely, PTEN overexpression promoted differentiation and enhanced sensitivity of NB4 cell line to physiological levels of ATRA. Finally, we found that PTEN overexpression restored PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Taken together, these results demonstrated that up-regulated miR-382-5p in NB4 cell line inhibited granulocytic differentiation through the miR-382-5p/PTEN axis, uncovering PTEN as a critical element in the granulocytic differentiation program induced by ATRA in APL.","['Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.

Importantly, the presence of peroxidase enhances its biological efficiency. We have now evaluated a panel of cancer cell lines with bromelain in presence or absence of peroxidase to identify that the combination has higher apoptosis inducing potential in all those cell lines. Bromelain plus peroxidase (BM-PR) inhibited acute myeloid (K562) cell proliferation and altered the morphological features. Incidence of apoptosis was established by using annexin V exposure and this was confirmed that the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase in a concentration-dependent manner. BM-PR increased the intracellular ROS level and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential, as detected using dichlorofluores cin diacetate (DCFDA). It also regulated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins like Bax, Bcl2, caspase-3 and cytochrome besides causing up-regulation of p53 as determined by western blot analysis. These results suggest that BM-PR from pineapple induces apoptosis better than only bromelain in acute myeloid leukemia cells possibly via mitochondria dependent pathway.","['Immunology Microbiology Lab, Department of Human Physiology, Tripura University, Suryamaninagar, 799102 Agartala, Tripura, India.', 'Research Institute in Oncology & Hematology, Cancer Care Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3E OV9, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Wexner Medical Center,The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.

Furthermore, these polysaccharides inhibited the early step of HCV infection but had no inhibitory effects on HTLV-1 replication. To further examine the specificity of these polysaccharides in viral infections, we used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 infection.

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"Galectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins and these have very high affinity for beta-galactoside containing glycoproteins and glycolipids. Amongst sixteen types of galectin, the role of galectin 1, 3, 9 and 12 is defined in the development and progression of different types of leukemia including acute myeloid leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, adult T cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. There are multiple mechanisms through which these galectins may affect tumor proliferation. These may include increased production of tumor resistance conferring proteins such as multidrug resistance (MDR-1) and myeloid cell leukemia (MCL-1). Moreover, galectin-9 may act on Tim-3 receptors present on the circulating CD8(+) T cells to impair immune system function and the latter provide an ideal environment for the proliferation of leukemic cells. The present review describes the role and mechanisms involved in galectin-mediated development and progression of different types of leukemia.","['The Department of Anesthesia, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, China.

Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and severe photosensitivity related to mogamulizumab have been reported. This study investigated whether severe radiation-induced dermatitis occurred in patients undergoing radiotherapy after the administration of mogamulizumab for adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 46 courses of radiotherapy administered to 15 consecutive patients with adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (acute, n = 7; lymphoma, n = 7; smouldering, n = 1) who received mogamulizumab before or during radiotherapy at three institutions between 2012 and 2017. Results: During 43 of the 46 radiotherapy courses, patients developed Grade </=1 radiation-induced dermatitis. No patient developed Grade >/=3 radiation-induced dermatitis. No patient was prescribed ointments as prophylactic treatment for radiation-induced dermatitis. Development of radiation-induced dermatitis was not significantly associated with the number of days since the administration of mogamulizumab prior to radiotherapy (P = 0.85), frequency of administration of mogamulizumab before/during radiotherapy (P = 0.33), administration of mogamulizumab during radiotherapy (P = 0.41) or types of lesions in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma cases (cutaneous vs. non-cutaneous, P = 0.74). Development of radiation-induced dermatitis was significantly related to the total cutaneous dose (mean, 31.9 Gy [95% confidence interval: 26.6-37.1 Gy] vs. 19.7 Gy [95% confidence interval: 16.2-23.2 Gy], P = 0.0004) and total prescribed dose (mean, 31.5 Gy [95% confidence interval: 26.2-36.8 Gy] vs. 18.5 Gy [95% confidence interval: 15.0-22.0 Gy], P = 0.0002).

Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase and a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, has been shown to play a role in GvHD pathology. Although not yet clear, one proposed mechanism is through selective tri-methylation of lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3) that marks the promoter region of multiple pro-apoptotic genes, leading to repression of these genes in allo-reactive T cells. We found that selective pharmacologic inhibition of H3K27me3 with EPZ6438 or GSK126 did not prevent murine GvHD. This suggests the GvHD mitigating properties of DZNep are independent from H3K27me3 inhibition. Furthermore, while pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 by DZNep has been shown to be effective in abrogating mouse GvHD, we found that DZNep was not effective in preventing GvHD in a human T cell xenograft mouse model. Although EZH2 is an attractive target to harness donor allo-reactive T cells in the post-transplant setting to modulate GvHD and the anti-leukemia effect, our results suggest that more selective and effective ways to inhibit EZH2 in human T cells are required.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6026-1347'],20181119,,,"['P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6242356,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred and thirty six de novo AML patients were consecutively enrolled and then underwent conventional induction chemotherapy. Bone marrow samples were obtained from all AML patients and controls. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to detect lncRNA TUG1 expression. KG-1 cells were transfected by TUG1 inhibitor (TUG1 (-)) and blank inhibitor (NC (-)) plasmids. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK8 and AV/PI assays, and apoptotic markers expressions were detected by Western blot assay. RESULTS: LncRNA TUG1 expression was higher in AML patients compared to controls, and it was positively correlated with white blood cell counts as well as poor risk stratification. Additionally, elevated lncRNA TUG1 expression was observed in non-complete remission (non-CR) patients compared to CR patients, and it was correlated with shorter event-free survival and overall survival in AML patients. In the in vitro experiments, lncRNA TUG1 expression was upregulated in AML cell lines compared to control cells, and cell proliferation ability was reduced, but cell apoptosis rate was promoted in TUG1 (-) group compared to NC (-) group at 72 hours after transfection in KG-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA TUG1 predicts advanced disease conditions and poor prognosis in AML patients, and its knockout decreases proliferation and increases apoptosis of AML cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical data including age, treatment modalities and duration of use in the myeloproliferative phase, latency to leukemic transformation (LT), characteristics of leukemia, chemotherapy administration, and survival after LT were examined. Furthermore, factors associated with leukemia transformation were analyzed. RESULTS: Over a 13-year period, nine patients had LT in 192 Ph-negative MPNs. Among these patients, two patients had polycythemia vera (PV), three patients had essential thrombocythemia (ET), and four patients had myelofibrosis (MF). The median age at MPN diagnosis was 51 years old (range: 42-69 years old), and the median age upon reaching LT was 57 years old (range: 46-72 years old). Furthermore, the median latency to LT was 72.8 months (range: 7-144 months). Five patients had cytogenetic abnormalities (62.5%), with abnormalities in chromosomes -5, +8 and -7 being common. Eight patients underwent the JAK2 V617F gene test when diagnosed with MPN. The prognosis of patients with LT was poor, and the average survival time was 6.7 months. This was not correlated with the treatment. CONCLUSION: LT in Ph-negative MPNs is rare, and has poor prognosis, which has been consistently reported in a number of studies, However, this needs to be further confirmed through larger studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is attributable to mutations in G6PT1, the gene for the glucose-6-phosphate transporter responsible for transport of glucose into the endoplasmic reticulum. Neutropenia in GSD Ib is now frequently treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). We formed a cooperative group to review outcomes of the long-term treatment of GSD Ib patients treated with G-CSF. RECENT FINDINGS: The study enrolled 103 patients (48 men and 55 women), including 47 currently adult patients. All of these patients were treated with G-CSF, starting at a median age of 3.8 years (range 0.04-33.9 years) with a median dose of 3.0 mcg/kg/day (range 0.01-93.1 mcg/kg/day) for a median of 10.3 years (range 0.01-29.3 years). Neutrophils increased in response to G-CSF in all patients (median values before G-CSF 0.2 x 10/l, on G-CSF 1.20 x 10/l). Treatment increased spleen size (before G-CSF, 47%, on treatment on G-CSF 76%), and splenomegaly was the dose-limiting adverse effect of treatment (pain and early satiety). Clinical observations and records attest to reduce frequency of infectious events and the severity of inflammatory bowel symptoms, but fever and recurrent infections remain a significant problem. In the cohort of patients followed carefully through the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry, four patients have developed myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia and we are aware of four other cases, (altogether seven on G-CSF, one never treated with G-CSF). Liver transplantation in five patients did not correct neutropenia. Four patients had hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; two adults and two children were transplanted; one adult and one child survived. SUMMARY: GSD Ib is a complex disorder of glucose metabolism causing severe chronic neutropenia. G-CSF is effective to raise blood neutrophil counts and reduce fevers and infections in most patients. In conjunction with other therapies (salicylates, mesalamine sulfasalazine and prednisone), G-CSF ameliorates inflammatory bowel symptoms, but doses must be limited because it increases spleen size associated with abdominal pain.","['Division of GIM, Department of Medicine, University of Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of GIM, Department of Medicine, University of Washington.', 'Division of GIM, Department of Medicine, University of Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry, Seattle, Washington.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Glycogen Storage Disease Program, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Glycogen Storage Disease Program, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut, USA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation/Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Hematopoiesis, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Molecular Hematopoiesis, University Children's Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Glycogen Storage Disease Program, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut, USA.""]",,,,,['R24 AI049393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7000169,,,,,['NIHMS1548665'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 18.,"BACKGROUND: While it is known that CD123 is normally strongly expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and completely absent on nucleated red blood cells, detailed information regarding CD123 expression in acute leukemia is scarce and, if available, hard to compare due to different methodologies. METHODS: CD123 expression was evaluated using standardized EuroFlow immunophenotyping in 139 pediatric AML, 316 adult AML, 193 pediatric BCP-ALL, 69 adult BCP-ALL, 101 pediatric T-ALL, and 28 adult T-ALL patients. Paired diagnosis-relapse samples were available for 57 AML and 19 BCP-ALL patients. Leukemic stem cell (LSC) data was available for 32 pediatric AML patients. CD123 expression was evaluated based on mean fluorescence intensity, median fluorescence intensity, and percentage CD123 positive cells. RESULTS: EuroFlow panels were stable over time and between laboratories. CD123 was expressed in the majority of AML and BCP-ALL patients, but absent in most T-ALL patients. Within AML, CD123 expression was lower in erythroid/megakaryocytic leukemia, higher in NPM1 mutated and FLT3-ITD mutated leukemia, and comparable between LSC and leukemic blasts. Within BCP-ALL, CD123 expression was higher in patients with (high) hyperdiploid karyotypes and the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Interestingly, CD123 expression was increased in BCP-ALL relapses while highly variable in AML relapses (compared to CD123 expression at diagnosis). CONCLUSIONS: Authors evaluated CD123 expression in a large cohort of acute leukemia patients, based on standardized and reproducible methodology. Our results may facilitate stratification of patients most likely to respond to CD123 targeted therapies and serve as reference for CD123 expression (in health and disease). (c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Dec 31.,"Continuous processing for the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) gains more and more importance. Several solutions exist for all the necessary production steps, leading to the possibility to build fully continuous processes. Low pH viral inactivation is a part of the standard platform process for mAb production. Consequently, Klutz et al. introduced the coiled flow inverter (CFI) as a tool for continuous low pH viral inactivation. Besides theoretical calculations of viral reduction, no viral clearance study has been presented so far. In addition, the validation of continuous viral clearance is often neglected in the already existing studies for continuous processing. This study shows in detail the development and execution of a virus study for continuous low pH viral inactivation inside a CFI. The concept presented is also valid for adaptation to other continuous viral clearance steps. The development of this concept includes the technical rationale for an experimental setup, a valid spiking procedure, and finally a sampling method. The experimental results shown represent a viral study using xenotropic murine leukemia virus as a model virus. Two different protein A (ProtA) chromatography setups with varying pH levels were tested. In addition, one of these setups was tested against a batch experiment utilizing the same process material. The results show that sufficient low pH viral inactivation (decadic logarithm reduction value >4) was achieved in all experiments. Complete viral inactivation took place within the first 14.5 min for both continuous studies and the batch study, hence showing similar results. This study therefore represents a successful virus study concept and experiment for a continuous viral inactivation step.

Epub 2018 Nov 19.,"We report the case of an 88-year-old Japanese man with erythrodermic involvement of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). He had a history of pharyngeal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma successfully treated with polychemotherapy including cyclophosphamide and epirubicin, 6 years before the current illness. He presented with numerous reddish, coalescing, flat-topped papules on the trunk and extremities, sparing the skin folds of the abdomen, the features of which mimicked those of papuloerythroderma. Immunohistochemistry showed perivascular and epidermotropic infiltration of CD3(+) CD4(+) T cells in the cutaneous lesion. However, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the skin infiltrating T cells were negative for surface CD4, and that CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) cells made up 92% of the T-cell fraction of peripheral blood. The circulating atypical T cells had a round or oval nucleus and prominent nucleoli, and the deletion of chromosomes 6q, 13 and 17. These cytological profiles were consistent with those of T-PLL and distinct from those of Sezary cells. The same T-cell clone was detected in the cutaneous lesion and peripheral blood, but the expression of CD62L was absent in the skin infiltrates and present in the circulating cells. No specific mutation was detected in STAT3 or STAT5B. Although low-dose oral etoposide had a beneficial effect on the skin rash, a fatal crisis of marked leukocytosis (169 x 10(3) /muL) occurred 19 months after the illness onset. CD62L-leukemic cells of T-PLL may infiltrate the skin to form papuloerythroderma-like cutaneous lesions.","['Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support of Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support of Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support of Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6457-0307', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4192-5707', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-065X']",20181119,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 Japanese Dermatological Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 18.,"The aim of our study was to determine regions of loss of heterozygosity, copy number variation analysis, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Brazilian patients with cystinuria. A linkage study was performed using DNA samples from six patients with cystinuria and six healthy individuals. Genotyping was done with the Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). For validation, SNPs were genotyped using a TaqMan((R)) SNP Genotyping Assay Kit. The homozygote polymorphic genotype of SNP rs17383719 in the gene PBX1 was more frequent (P = 0.015) in cystinuric patients. The presence of the polymorphic allele for this SNP increased the chance of cystinuria by 3.0-fold (P = 0.036). Pre-B-cell leukaemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) was overexpressed 3.3-fold in patients with cystinuria. However, when we compared the gene expression findings with the genotyping, patients with a polymorphic homozygote genotype had underexpression of PBX1, while patients with a heterozygote or wild-type homozygote genotype had overexpression of PBX1. There is a 3-fold increase in the risk of the development of cystinuria among individuals with this particular SNP in the PBX1 gene. We postulate that the presence of this SNP alters the expression of PBX1, thus affecting the renal absorption of cystine and other amino acids, predisposing to nephrolithiasis.","['Laboratory of Medical Investigation (LIM55), Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endourology and Stone Disease Section, Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medical Investigation (LIM55), Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endourology and Stone Disease Section, Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endourology and Stone Disease Section, Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medical Investigation (LIM55), Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medical Investigation (LIM55), Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endourology and Stone Disease Section, Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endourology and Stone Disease Section, Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endourology and Stone Disease Section, Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medical Investigation (LIM55), Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medical Investigation (LIM55), Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endourology and Stone Disease Section, Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3564-3597', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4505-8508']",20181118,,,,,PMC6349145,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Nov 18.,"Asparaginase is essential in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treatment, however hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) hampers anti-neoplastic efficacy. Patients with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity have been shown to possess zero asparaginase enzyme activity. Using this measurement to define the phenotype, we investigated genetic predisposition to PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). From July 2008 to March 2016, 1494 children were treated on the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol. Cases were defined by clinical hypersensitivity and no enzyme activity, controls had enzyme activity >/= 100 iu/l and no hypersensitivity symptoms. PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity was reported in 13.8% (206/1494) of patients. Fifty-nine cases and 772 controls fulfilled GWAS inclusion criteria. The CNOT3 variant rs73062673 on 19q13.42, was associated with PEG-asparaginase allergy (P = 4.68 x 10(-8) ). We further identified two signals on chromosome 6 in relation to HLA-DQA1 (P = 9.37 x 10(-6) ) and TAP2 (P = 1.59 x 10(-5) ). This study associated variants in CNOT3 and in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity, suggesting that not only genetic variations in the HLA region, but also regulation of these genes are of importance in the biology of this toxicity. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the importance of using asparaginase enzyme activity measurements to identify PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity.","['Child and Adolescent Health, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Bio- and Health Informatics, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', ""Department of Women's and Children's health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's health, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Child and Adolescent Health, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and Turku University, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', ""Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia."", ""Clinic of Children's Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Child and Adolescent Health, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2695-8391', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2695-7244', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7444-7652', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9350-1538']",20181118,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,['Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology Oncology (NOPHO) group'],,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jan 16.,"Protein A chromatography is an effective capture step to separate Fc-containing biopharmaceuticals from cell culture impurities but is generally not effective for virus removal, which tends to vary among different products. Previous findings have pointed to the differences in feedstocks to protein A, composed of the products and other cell culture-related impurities. To separate the effect of the feedstock components on virus removal, and understand why certain monoclonal antibody (mAb) products have low virus log reduction values (LRVs) across protein A chromatography, we investigated the partitioning of three types of viruses on Eshmuno(R) A columns. Using pure mAbs, we found that low LRVs were correlated with the presence of the particular mAb product itself, causing altered partitioning patterns. Three virus types were tested, and the trend in partitioning was the same for retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs) expressed in the cell substrate, and its model virus xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMuLV), whereas slightly different for murine minute virus. These results were extended from previous observation described by Bach and Connell-Crowley (2015) studying XMuLV partitioning on MabSelect SuRe columns, providing further evidence using additional types of viruses and resin. Other product-specific cell culture impurities in harvested cell culture fluid played a lesser role in causing low LRVs. In addition, using high throughput screening (HTS) methods and Eshmuno(R) A resin plates, we identified excipients with ionic and hydrophobic properties that could potentially alleviate the mAb-induced LRV reduction, indicating that both ionic and hydrophobic interactions were involved. More excipients of such nature or combinations, once optimized, can potentially be used as load and/or wash additives to improve virus removal by protein A. We have demonstrated that HTS is a valuable tool for this type of screening, whether to gain deeper understanding of a mechanism, or to provide guidance during the optimization of protein A process with improved virus removal.","['Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bedford, Massachusetts.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'EMD Millipore Corporation, Burlington, Massachusetts.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0293-4475'],20190116,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Demographic and clinical data of CLL patients diagnosed at our institution between 1989 and 2013 were collected. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the role of PLR in the duration of watchful waiting, postdiagnosis survival and postchemotherapy survival. Results: The data of 100 patients with CLL were reviewed for this study. The PLR correlated only to watchful waiting in the univariable analysis (Hazard ratio = 0.48 [0.32-0.73]; p = 0.018). In the multivariable analysis, the duration of watchful waiting was determined by Binet staging and lymphocyte count (p < 0.001). The postdiagnosis survival was determined by age (p = 0.002) and lymphocyte count (p = 0.010). Conclusion: The PLR did not seem to act as a prognostic biomarker for CLL.","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.']",,20181005,,,,,PMC6234458,"['Financial & competing interests disclosure The authors have no relevant', 'affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a', 'financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials', 'discussed in the manuscript.

Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the WT1 gene are described in 10-15% of normal-karyotype AML (NK-AML) in pediatric and adult patients. Similar WT1 mutations have been reported in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). WT1 mutations have been independently associated with treatment failure and poor prognosis in NK-AML. Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) commonly co-occur with WT1-mutant AML, suggesting a cooperative role in leukemogenesis. The functional role of WT1 mutations in hematologic malignancies appears to be complex and is not yet fully elucidated. Here, we describe the hematologic phenotype of a knock-in mouse model of a Wt1 mutation (R394W), described in cases of human leukemia. We show that Wt1 (+/R394W) mice develop MDS which becomes 100% penetrant in a transplant model, exhibit an aberrant expansion of myeloid progenitor cells, and demonstrate enhanced self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. We crossbred Wt1 (+/R394W) mice with knock-in Flt3 (+/ITD) mice, and show that mice with both mutations (Flt3 (+/ITD)/Wt1 (+/R394W)) develop a transplantable MDS/MPN, with more aggressive features compared to either single mutant mouse model.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics/Cancer Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Current affiliation: Departments of Pediatrics and Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",,20181019,,,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6219680,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST V.H. has ownership interest in Codified Genomics, LLC.

Increased glucose and lipid metabolism as well as mitochondrial activity have been shown in solid tumors but also in leukemic cells. As tumor cells are able to escape the blockade of one metabolic pathway by a compensatory increase in other pathways, treatment strategies simultaneously targeting metabolism at different sites are currently developed. However, the number of clinically applicable anti-metabolic drugs is still limited. Here, we analyzed the impact of the anti-diabetic drug metformin alone or in combination with two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) diclofenac and diflunisal on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary patient blasts. Diclofenac but not diflunisal reduced lactate secretion in different AML cell lines (THP-1, U937, and KG-1) and both drugs increased respiration at low concentrations. Despite these metabolic effects, both NSAIDs showed a limited effect on tumor cell proliferation and viability up to a concentration of 0.2 mM. In higher concentrations of 0.4-0.8 mM diflunisal alone exerted a clear effect on proliferation of AML cell lines and blocked respiration. Single treatment with the anti-diabetic drug metformin blocked mitochondrial respiration, but proliferation and viability were not affected. However, combining all three drugs exerted a strong cytostatic and cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells. Comparable to the results obtained with THP-1 cells, the combination of all three drugs significantly reduced proliferation of primary leukemic blasts and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, NSAIDs supported the effect of low dose chemotherapy with cytarabine and reduced proliferation of primary AML blasts. Taken together we show that low concentrations of metformin and the two NSAIDs diclofenac and diflunisal exert a synergistic inhibitory effect on AML proliferation and induce apoptosis most likely by blocking tumor cell metabolism. Our results underline the feasibility of applying anti-metabolic drugs for AML therapy.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology (RCI), Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology (RCI), Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology (RCI), Regensburg, Germany.']",,20181102,,,,,PMC6224440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, prophylactic measures, including intrathecal (IT) methotrexate, reduce the incidence of CNS relapse in these patients considerably. Unfortunately, IT methotrexate can cause several neurologic complications, including transverse myelopathy; ie, the development of isolated spinal cord dysfunction over hours or days following the IT infusion of methotrexate, but in the absence of a compressive lesion. Transverse myelopathy following IT methotrexate is a well-established clinical phenomenon, but the histologic features have been described only very rarely. We report the autopsy findings from a 31-year-old man with a history of T-cell ALL who received prophylactic IT methotrexate in anticipation of a bone marrow transplant. Microscopic examination showed transverse necrosis of the thoracic cord, with massive infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates.

This in vitro system provides an invaluable model to dissect the emergence of hematopoiesis in humans. However, the study of hematopoiesis specification is hampered by a lack of consensus in the timing of hemogenic endothelium analysis and the full hematopoietic potential of this population. Here, our data reveal a sharp decline in the hemogenic potential of endothelium populations isolated over the course of hESC differentiation. Furthermore, by tracking the dynamic expression of CD31 and CD235a at the onset of hematopoiesis, we identified three populations of hematopoietic progenitors, representing primitive and definitive subsets that all emerge from the earliest specified hemogenic endothelium. Our data establish that hemogenic endothelium populations endowed with primitive and definitive hematopoietic potential are specified simultaneously from the mesoderm in differentiating hESCs.","['Developmental Haematopoiesis Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Developmental Haematopoiesis Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Stem Cell Biology Group, CRUK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Institucio Catalana Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Biology Group, CRUK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.

Epub 2018 Nov 17.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the life experiences and processes that occur as adolescent and young adult leukemia survivors return to social life using grounded theory. METHOD: This study comprised 14 adolescents and young adults who visited a hospital for follow-up care after treatment of leukemia. We used in-depth interviews to examine the participants' experiences in returning to social life. The semistructured questionnaire examined ""good and bad experiences in returning to social life,"" ""sources of happiness and stress,"" and ""strategies for managing stressful events."" RESULTS: We extracted 6 categories and 21 concepts from the interviews. We grouped the 6 categories into a core category and three phases: ""catching up with others,"" ""discovering myself,"" and ""planning my future."" A core category shown through all phases was ""fear of recurrence."" The ""catching up with others"" phase included themes of ""feeling different from others"" and ""wanting to be like others."" The ""discovering myself"" phase included ""completing one thing at a time"" and ""recognizing myself as special."" The ""planning my future"" phase included ""looking for things I can do."" CONCLUSIONS: Self-esteem was an important issue for adolescent leukemia survivors; negative illness perception affected self-esteem in both adolescents and young adults. It is important for health care providers to develop programs to help adolescent and young adult leukemia survivors to perceive their disease experiences more positively and to take part in social life, including school life.","['1 Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea.', '2 The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1909-4038'],20181117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 17.,"A conditioning regimen with fludarabine and myeloablative dose of busulfan (FLU/BU4) has been commonly used in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). However, there are two major problems with this regimen: insufficient anti-leukemic effect, especially in advanced cases, and slow time to complete donor-type chimerism, especially T-cell chimerism. To overcome these issues, we designed a combination regimen with FLU (150 mg/m(2)), intravenous BU (12.8 mg/kg), and melphalan (100 mg/m(2)) (FLU/BU4/MEL) and conducted retrospective analyses of treatment outcomes at our institute. Forty-two patients with myeloid malignancies received allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation or peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (allo-BMT/PBSCT) with FLU/BU4/MEL regimen. The median age of patients was 46.5 years (20-63 years). Thirteen patients (31%) did not achieve complete hematological remission at transplantation. All patients examined achieved complete whole and T-cell chimerism within 1 month after allo-HCT. The 4-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 66.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 49.4-78.3%] and 59.5% (95% CI 43.2-72.6%) in all patients, and 49.4% (95% CI 19.7-73.6%) and 38.5% (95% CI 14.1-62.8%) in patients who were not in remission. In conclusion, FLU/BU4/MEL showed curative potential, even in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies, accompanied by achievement of rapid complete chimerism after allo-BMT/PBSCT.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan. uedat@bldon.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Osaka University Hospital, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-Oka, Suita, 565-0871, Japan.']",,20181117,,,['12908149/Otsuka Pharmaceutical'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"The mammary gland (MG) is a unique organ responsible for milk synthesis, secretion, and involution to prepare the gland for subsequent lactation. The mammary epithelial cells (MECs), which are the milk synthesizing units of the MG, proliferate, differentiate, undergo apoptosis and regenerate following a cyclic pathway of lactation - involution - lactation, fine-tuning these molecular events through hormones, growth factors and other regulatory molecules. The developmental stages of the MG are embryonic, prepubertal, pubertal, pregnancy, lactation and involution, with major developmental processes occurring after puberty. The involution stage includes interesting physiological processes such as MEC apoptosis, matrix remodeling, and the generation of cells regaining the shape of a virgin MG. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is the established master regulator of this process and aberrant expression of STAT3 leads to subnormal involution and may induce neoplasia. Several studies have reported on the molecular mechanism of MG involution with substantial knowledge being gained about this process; however, a deep understanding of this phenomenon has yet to be attained. This review focuses deeply on the molecular details of post-lactational regression, the signaling pathways involved in the lactation-involution cycle, and the latest developments in STAT3-associated MG neoplasia. Deep insight into the involution process will pave the way towards understanding the biology, apoptosis, and oncogenesis of the MG.","['Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal 132001, India; Department of Biotechnology, School of Bioengineering and Biosciences, Lovely Professional University (LPU), Phagwara 144411, Punjab, India.', 'Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal 132001, India.', 'Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal 132001, India.', 'Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal 132001, India.

Nevertheless, its role and mechanism in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been reported. To identify the genes that may participate in the development of APL, we analyzed data from an APL cDNA microarray (GSE12662) in the NCBI database, and found that ACTL6A was up-regulated in APL patients. Subsequently, we investigated the function and mechanisms of ACTL6A in myeloid cell development. The expression of ACTL6A was gradually decreased during granulocytic differentiation in all-trans retinoic acid-treated NB4 and HL-60 cells, and phorbol myristate acetate-treated HL-60 cells. We also found that knockdown of ACTL6A promoted differentiation in NB4 and HL-60 cells, and decreased the levels of Sox2 and Notch1. Mechanistically, ACTL6A interacted with and was co-localized with Sox2 and p53. Meanwhile, CBL0137, an activator of p53, decreased the expression of ACTL6A and promoted differentiation in NB4 and HL-60 cells. These findings suggest that the inhibition of ACTL6A promotes differentiation via the Sox2 and Notch1 signaling pathways. Furthermore, the differentiation promoted by inhibiting ACTL6A could be regulated by p53 via its physical interaction with ACTL6A.","['Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.

Epub 2018 Oct 29.,"LSD1 is implicated in a number of malignancies and has emerged as an exciting target. As part of our sustained efforts to develop novel reversible LSD1 inhibitors for epigenetic therapy of cancers, in this study, we reported a series of stilbene derivatives and evaluated their LSD1 inhibitory activities, obtaining several compounds as potent LSD1 inhibitors with IC50 values in submicromolar range. Enzyme kinetics studies and SPR assay suggested that compound 8c, the most active LSD1 inhibitor (IC50=283nM), potently inhibited LSD1 in a reversible and FAD competitive manner. Consistent with the kinetics data, molecular docking showed that compound 8c can be well docked into the FAD binding site of LSD1. Flow cytometry analysis showed that compound 8c was capable of up-regulating the expression of the surrogate cellular biomarker CD86 in THP-1 human leukemia cells, suggesting the ability to block LSD1 activity in cells. Compound 8c showed good inhibition against THP-1 and MOLM-13 cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 8.34muM, respectively. Moreover, compound 8c significantly inhibited colony formation of THP-1 cells dose dependently.","['School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan 453003, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan 453003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology, Ministry of Education of China, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R & D and Preclinical Safety, Institute of Drug Discovery and Development, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan 453003, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan 453003, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shangqiu Normal University, Shangqiu, Henan 476000, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology, Ministry of Education of China, Co-innovation Center of Henan Province for New Drug R & D and Preclinical Safety, Institute of Drug Discovery and Development, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"The concurrent presence of JAK2 V617F, monocytosis, and bone marrow fibrosis can be observed in both chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). It can be challenging to distinguish CMML with JAK2 mutation and fibrosis from other myeloid neoplasms, particularly PMF. To identify key features that may help distinguish these 2 entities, we retrospectively studied 21 cases diagnosed as ""CMML"" with JAK2 V617F and bone marrow fibrosis that were identified from a cohort of 610 cases of CMML diagnosed in 2006 to 2016. Upon further review, we confirmed the diagnosis of CMML in 7 cases, 11 cases were reclassified as PMF, and 3 cases had features intermediate between CMML and PMF (gray zone). These 11 cases of PMF with monocytosis featured a higher JAK2 V617F allelic burden (median, 43%; range, 20%-62%) and atypical pleomorphic megakaryocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei. Complete blood count showed more pronounced myeloid left shift. In contrast, 7 CMML cases had significantly lower JAK2 V617F allelic burden (median, 17%; range, 5%-36%; P < .0001) and dysplastic megakaryocytes along with variable degree of dysplasia in other lineages. The median survival of PMF and CMML patients was 32 and 40 months, respectively. We conclude that besides morphology of megakaryocytes and other features, JAK2 V617F allelic burden can help differentiate CMML from PMF with monocytosis. SRSF2 and RAS mutations are observed in both disease categories. Rare gray-zone cases exist with hybrid features.","['Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, The University of Texas Health Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Epub 2019 Jan 15.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) stereotyped subsets #6 and #8 include cases expressing unmutated B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) (U-CLL). Subset #6 (IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20) is less aggressive compared to subset #8 (IGHV4-39/IGKV1(D)-39) which has the highest risk for Richter's transformation among all CLL. The underlying reasons for this divergent clinical behavior are not fully elucidated. To gain insight into this issue, here we focused on epigenomic signatures and their links with gene expression, particularly investigating genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in subsets #6 and #8 as well as other U-CLL cases not expressing stereotyped BcR IG. We found that subset #8 showed a distinctive DNA methylation profile compared to all other U-CLL cases, including subset #6. Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression revealed significant correlation for several genes, particularly highlighting a relevant role for the TP63 gene which was hypomethylated and overexpressed in subset #8. This observation was validated by quantitative PCR, which also revealed TP63 mRNA overexpression in additional nonsubset U-CLL cases. BcR stimulation had distinct effects on p63 protein expression, particularly leading to induction in subset #8, accompanied by increased CLL cell survival. This pro-survival effect was also supported by siRNA-mediated downregulation of p63 expression resulting in increased apoptosis. In conclusion, we report that DNA methylation profiles may vary even among CLL patients with similar somatic hypermutation status, supporting a compartmentalized approach to dissecting CLL biology. Furthermore, we highlight p63 as a novel prosurvival factor in CLL, thus identifying another piece of the complex puzzle of clinical aggressiveness.","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty of the Masaryk University, Brno, Czech republic.', 'Department of Immunotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Lund University, Sweden.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Departamento de Fundamentos Clinicos, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Department of Immunotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland and Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"BACKGROUND: Acute leukemias (AL) with a Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement (MLLr) represent a group of leukemic entities conferring intermediate to adverse prognoses. Multiple chromatin-associated proteins have been shown to play essential roles during the genesis of MLLr AL. Some chromatin-associated proteins function as negative regulators of MLLr AL whereas others are required for leukemic initiation or maintenance - the latter group constituting potential therapeutic targets. Most of the identified proteins have been functionally analyzed using experimental models with human/murine normal cells transformed by MLL-AF9 or other MLL fusion products, which may recapitulate most but not all aspects of human AML, such as immune system interactions - features of which the importance is rapidly emerging. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we review chromatin-associated proteins fundamental to MLLr AL development, highlighting those with targeting potential by small molecule inhibitors. In particular, we focus on synthetic targeting of multiple chromatin-associated proteins, a strategy that shows superior therapeutic efficacy and offers hope for overcoming drug resistance.","[""Laboratory for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong Province, 261053, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Bioscience and Technology, Weifang Medical University, #21406 Basic Laboratory Building, 7166 Baotongxi Street, Weifang, Shandong Province, 261053, People's Republic of China."", 'Institute of Pathology, University Medicine Rostock, Strempelstrasse 14, 18055, Rostock, Germany. bjoern.schneider@med.uni-rostock.de.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0282-7330'],20181116,,,"['81370628/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81570157/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'ZR2015CL023/Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese', 'Scholars', 'J16LL54/Shandong Province Higher Educational Science and Technology Program']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the predictive value of MFC MRD is affected by technical challenges, interpretive complexities, and inadequate standardization, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we critically review the methodological principles of the MFC MRD assay and discuss clinical implications of MRD. RECENT FINDINGS: Key components of MFC MRD assays to be discussed include the principles of MFC, panel selection, analysis approaches, level of quantifiable MRD and calculation, reporting, and areas of improvements. Key components of clinical implications include context-dependent detection threshold and the integral role of MRD assessment by MFC in the era of ever-expanding molecular testing. With advancements in technology and standardization, MFC along with molecular assays will continue to play an important role in MRD assessment to evaluate treatment response and risk stratification.","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, BioCenter EB3.234, 2330 Inwood Road, Dallas, TX, 75390-9317, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, BioCenter EB3.234, 2330 Inwood Road, Dallas, TX, 75390-9317, USA. weina.chen@utsouthwestern.edu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the development and introduction of novel therapeutics to treat relapsed pediatric leukemia is urgently needed. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has been shown to be effective against adult hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, but is frequently associated with the development of resistance. Carfilzomib is a next-generation proteasome inhibitor that has shown promising results against refractory adult hematological malignancies. OBJECTIVE: Carfilzomib has been extensively studied in adult hematological malignancies, providing the rationale for evaluating proof-of-concept activity of carfilzomib in pediatric leukemia. METHODS: The effects of carfilzomib on pediatric leukemia cell lines and primary pediatric leukemia patient samples were investigated in vitro using the alamar blue cytotoxicity assay, western blotting, and a proteasome activity assay. Synergy with commonly used anticancer drugs was determined by calculation of combination indices. RESULTS: In vitro preclinical data show pharmacologically relevant concentrations of carfilzomib are cytotoxic to pediatric leukemia cell lines and primary pediatric leukemia cells. Target modulation studies validate the effective inhibition of the proteasome and induction of apoptosis. We also identify agents that have effective synergy with carfilzomib in these cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide pre-clinical information that can be incorporated into future early-phase clinical trials for the assessment of carfilzomib as a treatment for children with refractory hematological malignancies.","[""POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary and the Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail NW, Calgary, Alberta, T3B 6A8, Canada."", ""POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary and the Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail NW, Calgary, Alberta, T3B 6A8, Canada."", ""POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary and the Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail NW, Calgary, Alberta, T3B 6A8, Canada."", ""POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary and the Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail NW, Calgary, Alberta, T3B 6A8, Canada."", ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ""POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary and the Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail NW, Calgary, Alberta, T3B 6A8, Canada. a.narendran@ucalgary.ca.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"The aetiology of childhood cancers remains largely unknown. Space-time clustering of cases might imply an aetiological role of infections. We aimed to review the evidence of space-time clustering of specific childhood cancers. We searched Medline and Embase for population-based studies that covered a pre-defined study area, included cases under 20 years of age and were published before July 2016. We extracted all space-time clustering tests and calculated the proportion of positive tests per diagnostic group. In a pooled analysis, we performed a Knox test of the number of pairs of cases close to each other in time and space pooled across studies. 70 studies met our eligibility criteria, 32 of which reported Knox tests. For leukaemia, the proportion of positive tests was higher than expected by chance at both time of diagnosis (26%) and birth (11%). The pooled analysis showed strong evidence of clustering at diagnosis for children aged 0-5 years for a spatial and temporal lag of 5 km and 6 months, respectively (p < 0.001). The evidence was mixed for lymphoma and tumours of the central nervous system. The current study suggests that leukaemia cases cluster in space-time due to an aetiological factor affecting children under 5 years of age. The observed pattern of clustering of young children close to time of diagnosis is compatible with Greaves' delayed-infections-hypothesis.","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland. ben.spycher@ispm.unibe.ch.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5273-1954', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1430-5695']",20181116,,,"['3049-08-2012/Krebsliga Schweiz', '3515-08-2014/Krebsliga Schweiz', '4012-08-2016/Krebsliga Schweiz', '320030_176218/Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen', 'Forschung', 'PZ00P3_147987/Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen', 'Forschung']",,PMC6326085,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 17.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. Although the cure rate of ALL has greatly improved, a considerable number of patients suffer from relapse of leukemia. Therefore, ALL remains the leading cause of death from cancer during childhood. To improve the cure rate of these patients, precisely detecting patients with high risk of relapse and incorporating new targeted therapies are urgently needed. This study investigated inexpensive, rapid, next-generation sequencing of more than 150 cancer-related genes for matched diagnostic, remission, and relapse samples of 17 patients (3 months to 15 years old) with relapsed ALL. In this analysis, we identified 16 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion/deletion variants and 19 copy number variants (CNVs) at diagnosis and 28 SNVs and insertion/deletion variants and 22 CNVs at relapse. With these genetic alterations, we could detect several B cell precursor ALL patients with high-risk gene alterations who were not stratified into the highest-risk group (5/8, 62.5%). We also detected potentially actionable genetic variants in about half of the patients (8/17, 47.1%). Among them, we found that one patient harbored germline TP53 mutation as a secondary finding. This inexpensive, rapid method can be immediately applied as clinical sequencing and could lead to better management of these patients and potential improvement in the survival rate in childhood ALL.","['Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of BioBank, BioRepository/BioMarker Analysis Center, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization, Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan. pajj236e@okayama-u.ac.jp.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5207-3779'],20181117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New challenges appear as we consider life after the disease, including professional challenges and the social reintegration of patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of chronic myeloid leukemia on employment within 2 years after diagnosis. This prospective, observational study included patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia and treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Two populations were defined as patients who reported modifications in their professional activity during the study (Acti-Pro+) and patients who did not report a modification (Acti-Pro-). Cancer survivors received a self-assessment questionnaire. The primary endpoint was to determine the professional status of patients. One hundred patients completed the questionnaire. Sixty-six patients out of 100 reported professional activity within 2 years after their diagnosis. During the 2 years after the diagnosis, 65.2% (95% confidence interval (CI), 53.7-76.7) of patients faced modifications in their professional activity due to chronic myeloid leukemia or adverse effects of drug treatments (group Acti-Pro+); in contrast, 34.8% of patients did not report any impact on their occupational activity (group Acti-Pro-). Among modifications to work organization, a change in the number of working hours was the most represented. Other modifications comprised changes in status or work pace. A majority of chronic myeloid leukemia patients face professional consequences of their disease and treatments. Our findings suggest that adverse drug reactions are a major factor affecting the occurrence of work modifications in this context.","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Occupational Diseases, Toulouse University Hospital, Batiment Turiaf, Place du Dr Baylac, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Universite Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM UMR1027 (The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research), Universite Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Toulouse University Hospital, IUCT-O, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Occupational Diseases, Toulouse University Hospital, Batiment Turiaf, Place du Dr Baylac, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France.', 'INSERM UMR1027 (The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research), Universite Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM UMR1027 (The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research), Universite Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Toulouse University Hospital, IUCT-O, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Toulouse University Hospital, IUCT-O, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Occupational Diseases, Toulouse University Hospital, Batiment Turiaf, Place du Dr Baylac, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France. herin.f@chu-toulouse.fr.', 'INSERM UMR1027 (The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research), Universite Toulouse III, Toulouse, France. herin.f@chu-toulouse.fr.']",,20181117,,,['ANR-11-PHUC-001/Agence Nationale de la Recherche'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"Bosutinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (2GTKI) approved at 400 mg once daily (QD) as first-line therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and at 500 mg QD in patients who are resistant to or intolerant of prior therapy. In clinical practice, bosutinib is often given to patients who have failed imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib (i.e., as fourth-line treatment), despite the limited data on its clinical benefit in this setting. We have retrospectively evaluated the results of bosutinib in a series of 62 CML patients who have failed to prior treatment with all three, imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. Median time on TKI treatment before bosutinib start was 105 (9-163) months, and median duration on bosutinib was 9 months (1-30). Overall, probabilities to achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were 25% and 24% respectively. After a median follow-up period of 14 months, the event-free survival and progression-free survival were 68 and 85%, respectively. Sixty-four percent of patients in CCyR at the time of bosutinib start were able to achieve MMR. In contrast, patients without CCyR, probabilities to obtain CCyR and MMR were 25% and 14%. Bosutinib was well tolerated in this heavily pretreated patients' cohort. Pleural effusions and diarrhea were the most frequent grade II-IV side effects, leading to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients. Bosutinib is an effective treatment option for patients who have failed previous 2GTKIs due to intolerance.

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"A finely tuned balance of self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation, and survival governs the pool size and regenerative capacity of blood-forming hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here, we report that protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) is a critical regulator of adult HSPC number and function that couples the proliferative and metabolic activities of HSPCs. PKCdelta-deficient mice showed a pronounced increase in HSPC numbers, increased competence in reconstituting lethally irradiated recipients, enhanced long-term competitive advantage in serial transplantation studies, and an augmented HSPC recovery during stress. PKCdelta-deficient HSPCs also showed accelerated proliferation and reduced apoptosis, but did not exhaust in serial transplant assays or induce leukemia. Using inducible knockout and transplantation models, we further found that PKCdelta acts in a hematopoietic cell-intrinsic manner to restrict HSPC number and bone marrow regenerative function. Mechanistically, PKCdelta regulates HSPC energy metabolism and coordinately governs multiple regulators within signaling pathways implicated in HSPC homeostasis. Together, these data identify PKCdelta as a critical regulator of HSPC signaling and metabolism that acts to limit HSPC expansion in response to physiological and regenerative demands.","['Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA rao.tata@unibas.ch amy_wagers@harvard.edu.', 'Section on Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Section on Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Section on Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Section on Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Section on Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Section on Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Section on Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Section on Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Section on Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA rao.tata@unibas.ch amy_wagers@harvard.edu.', 'Section on Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9928-5944', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4367-5043', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7583-9228', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0066-0485']",20181116,,,"['R01 HL088582/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK033201/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'PN2 EY018244/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK036836/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD004345/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL135287/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK103215/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK067536/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK031036/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6293338,,['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in science challenge the timely adoption of evidence-based care in community settings. To bridge the gap between what is possible and what is practiced, we researched approaches to developing an artificial intelligence (AI) application that can provide real-time patient-specific decision support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Oncology Expert Advisor (OEA) was designed to simulate peer-to-peer consultation with three core functions: patient history summarization, treatment options recommendation, and management advisory. Machine-learning algorithms were trained to construct a dynamic summary of patients cancer history and to suggest approved therapy or investigative trial options. All patient data used were retrospectively accrued. Ground truth was established for approximately 1,000 unique patients. The full Medline database of more than 23 million published abstracts was used as the literature corpus. RESULTS: OEA's accuracies of searching disparate sources within electronic medical records to extract complex clinical concepts from unstructured text documents varied, with F1 scores of 90%-96% for non-time-dependent concepts (e.g., diagnosis) and F1 scores of 63%-65% for time-dependent concepts (e.g., therapy history timeline). Based on constructed patient profiles, OEA suggests approved therapy options linked to supporting evidence (99.9% recall; 88% precision), and screens for eligible clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (97.9% recall; 96.9% precision). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated technical feasibility of an AI-powered application to construct longitudinal patient profiles in context and to suggest evidence-based treatment and trial options. Our experience highlighted the necessity of collaboration across clinical and AI domains, and the requirement of clinical expertise throughout the process, from design to training to testing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital advisors such as the Oncology Expert Advisor have the potential to augment the capacity and update the knowledge base of practicing oncologists. By constructing dynamic patient profiles from disparate data sources and organizing and vetting vast literature for relevance to a specific patient, such AI applications could empower oncologists to consider all therapy options based on the latest scientific evidence for their patients, and help them spend less time on information ""hunting and gathering"" and more time with the patients. However, realization of this will require not only AI technology maturation but also active participation and leadership by clincial experts.","['Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'IBM Watson, New York New York, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic & Cardiovascular Surgery, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic & Cardiovascular Surgery, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'IBM Watson, New York New York, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA lchin@utsystem.edu.']",,20181116,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6656515,"['Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest may be found at the end of this', 'article.']",['(c) AlphaMed Press 2018.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (rhLIF) to the degenerated NP cells cultured in vitro was found to stimulate the synthesis of ECM, and rhLIF could activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, coculture with PD98059, a signal inhibitor of ERK1/2, blocked the effect of rhLIF on the synthesis of ECM. To furtherly clarify the role of LIF, we carried out animal experiments and found that rhLIF treatment could successfully delay the degree of degeneration of the intervertebral disc in a rabbit model; but with the addition of PD98059, the function of rhLIF for degeneration protection disappeared. In summary, this study demonstrates that LIF plays a role in promoting ECM synthesis in the degenerated NP cells as a protective role in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), which is related to the activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway.","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Rd., Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Rd., Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Rd., Chongqing, 400016, China.', ""Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Ninth People's Hospital of Chongqing, No.69, Jialing Village, Beibei District, Chongqing, 400799, China.

METHODS: Various DLBCL and MCL cells were exposed to HHT and bortezomib alone or together after which apoptosis and signaling pathway perturbations were monitored by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Xenograft mouse models were used to assess tumor growth and animal survival. RESULTS: HHT and bortezomib co-administration synergistically induced apoptosis in GC-, ABC- and double-hit DLBCL cells. Similar interactions were observed in MCL cells and in primary lymphoma cells. HHT/bortezomib co-administration diminished binding of MCL-1 to both BAK and NOXA. Knock-down of NOXA significantly diminished lethality whereas MCL-1 knock-down or ectopic NOXA expression increased cell death. Notably, HHT/bortezomib lethality was dramatically reduced in BAK knockout or knockdown cells. Finally, HHT/bortezomib co-administration significantly improved survival compared to single agents in GC- and ABC- xenograft models while exhibiting little toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that HHT and bortezomib cooperate to kill DLBCL and MCL cells through a process involving MCL-1 down-regulation, NOXA up-regulation, and BAK activation. They also suggest that a strategy combining HHT with bortezomib warrants attention in DLBCL and MCL.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Room 229 Goodwin Research Building, 401 College Street, Richmond, VA, 23229, USA.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Room 229 Goodwin Research Building, 401 College Street, Richmond, VA, 23229, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Room 229 Goodwin Research Building, 401 College Street, Richmond, VA, 23229, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Room 229 Goodwin Research Building, 401 College Street, Richmond, VA, 23229, USA.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Room 229 Goodwin Research Building, 401 College Street, Richmond, VA, 23229, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Room 229 Goodwin Research Building, 401 College Street, Richmond, VA, 23229, USA. steven.grant@vcuhealth.org.', 'Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Richmond, VA, USA. steven.grant@vcuhealth.org.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Richmond, VA, USA. steven.grant@vcuhealth.org.', 'Human and Molecular Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Richmond, VA, USA. steven.grant@vcuhealth.org.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Richmond, VA, USA. steven.grant@vcuhealth.org.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4452-9320'],20181116,,,"['CA167708/National Cancer Institute', 'R01 CA205607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA205607/National Cancer Institute', 'R01 CA167708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '6472-15/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada']",,PMC6240231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last 20 years, the introduction of autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, increased the survival of MM patients by 50%. However, still a high proportion of patients relapse and become refractory, especially, high-risk patients with adverse cytogenetics where these treatment combinations have shown limited benefit. Therefore, novel strategies, such as immunotherapy, have been developed in the last few years to help improve the survival of these patients. Immunotherapy treatments include a high number of different strategies used to attack the tumor cells by using the immune system. Here, we will review the most successful immunotherapy strategies published up to date in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM, including monoclonal antibodies targeting specific antigens on the tumor cells, antibodies combined with cytotoxic drugs or Antibodies Drug Conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors which eliminate the barriers that damper immune cells and prevent them from attacking tumor cells, bi-specific T-cell engagers antibodies (BiTEs), bi-specific antibodies and the infusion of chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells.

Though gene expression data have been widely used to infer cellular regulatory networks, existing methods mainly infer correlations rather than causality. We developed statistical models and likelihood-ratio tests to infer causal gene regulatory networks using enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression information as a causal anchor and applied the framework to eRNA and transcript expression data from the FANTOM Consortium. Predicted causal targets of transcription factors (TFs) in mouse embryonic stem cells, macrophages and erythroblastic leukaemia overlapped significantly with experimentally-validated targets from ChIP-seq and perturbation data. We further improved the model by taking into account that some TFs might act in a quantitative, dosage-dependent manner, whereas others might act predominantly in a binary on/off fashion. We predicted TF targets from concerted variation of eRNA and TF and target promoter expression levels within a single cell type, as well as across multiple cell types. Importantly, TFs with high-confidence predictions were largely different between these two analyses, demonstrating that variability within a cell type is highly relevant for target prediction of cell type-specific factors. Finally, we generated a compendium of high-confidence TF targets across diverse human cell and tissue types.","['Division of Developmental Biology, The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Midlothian, EH25 9RG Scotland, UK.

MLV-based retroviral vectors are used in gene therapy trials. In some trials leukemia occurred through integration of the MLV vector in close proximity to cellular oncogenes. BET-mediated integration is poorly understood and the nature of integrase oligomers heavily debated. Here, we created wild-type infectious MLV vectors natively incorporating fluorescent labeled IN and performed single-molecule intensity and Forster resonance energy transfer experiments. The nuclear localization of the MLV pre-integration complex neither altered the IN content, nor its quaternary structure. Instead, BET-mediated interaction of the MLV intasome with chromatin in the post-mitotic nucleus reshaped its quaternary structure.","['Laboratory for Photochemistry and Spectroscopy, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Photochemistry and Spectroscopy, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Photochemistry and Spectroscopy, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'Center for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, I-38123 Trento, Italy.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Photochemistry and Spectroscopy, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Dynamic Bioimaging Lab, Advanced Optical Microscopy Centre and Biomedical Research Institute (BIOMED), Hasselt University, Agoralaan C, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.']",,,,,,,PMC6379647,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

The impact of hypomethylating agents (HMA) in the treatment of these high-risk patients is unknown. Here we retrospectively examined the remission rates and survival outcomes of 201 newly diagnosed patients >/=60 years old with therapy-related (t-AML), secondary (s-AML), or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Ninety-eight patients received IC, and 103 received HMA. Patients in the IC cohort were younger than those who received HMA (68 vs. 74 years; p < 0.01) with lower comorbidity burden. Composite complete remission rates (CR) were 39% in IC and 27% in the HMA cohorts (p = 0.10). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between the two cohorts (7.59 mos vs. 5.49 mos; HR 0.75 95% CI 0.55-1.02) despite the fact that more patients in the IC cohort (33% versus 5%, p < 0.01) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant. Patients with t-AML (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.33-0.97) and complex karyotype without monosomal karyotype (CK + MK-; HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19-0.75) had better OS following IC. Patients with CK + MK+ (HR 2.00; 95% CI 1.08-3.70) had improved OS following HMA. Our results support the use of HMA as an alternative upfront regimen in older individuals with newly diagnosed high-risk AML based on similar clinical outcomes to IC.","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, USA.

Specific cytomorphologic features suggesting distinctive AML-RCA were revealed at diagnosis in 62 (15.65%) patients, including AML with t(15;17) in 41 (66.13%), t(8;21) in 13 (20.97%) and inv(16)/t(16;16) in 8 (12.90%). Final diagnoses of AML-RCA according to WHO integrated diagnostic criteria were established in 66 (16.66%) cases, including AML with t(15;17) 40 (60.60%), t(8;21) 17 (25.76%), and inv(16)/t(16;16) 9 (13.64%). Discordance between cytomorphological and other integrated criteria was detected as missed/wrong-call in 0/1 for t(15;17), 6/2 for t(8;21) and 2/1 for inv(16)/t(16;16). The cytomorphological accuracy was 97.56% (40/41) for t(15;17), 57.89% (11/19) for t(8;21) and 70% (7/10) for inv (16)/t(16;16). Positive/negative predictive values of cytomorphological evaluation were: 97.56%/100% for t(15;17); 84.62%/88.68% for t(8;21); 87.50%/96.65% for inv(16)/t(16;16). Sensitivity/specificity were: 100%/96.15% for t(15;17); 64.10%/95.92% for t(8;21); 77.78%/98.25% for inv(16)/t(16;16). We confirmed that morphology is still a highly relevant evaluation method in diagnosing several common AML-RCAs before completing cytogenetic and molecular studies, enabling early detection, particularly of AML with t(15;17).","['Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Koste Todorovica 2, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia.

Epub 2018 Nov 3.,"B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous neoplasm often demonstrating extensive subclone diversity within each patient's disease. The immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus is a marker of clonal variation in B ALL due to its intrinsic role in B lymphocyte development and its diverse Vh(D)Jh rearrangement patterns. B ALL IGH evolution may contribute to limitations in minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring methods. Evolving technologies for IGH high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have demonstrated MRD detection as sensitive as 1 cell in 1,000,000. These methods may enhance the surveillance of B ALL in the setting of extensive subclone evolution and provide opportunities for detection and intervention before the onset of relapse. However, HTS MRD methods will need to be evaluated in the context of clinical trials in order to gain further insights about the clinical relevance of such sensitive B ALL MRD detection.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, United States.

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,"Genomes are not random sequences because natural selection has injected information in biological sequences for billions of years. Inspired by this idea, we developed a simple method to compare genomes considering nucleotide counts in subsequences (blocks) instead of their exact sequences. We introduce the Block Alignment method for comparing two genomes and based on this comparison method, define a similarity score and a distance. The presented model ignores nucleotide order in the sequence. On the other hand, in this block comparison method, due to exclusion of point mutations and small size variations, there is no need for high coverage sequencing which is responsible for the high costs of data production and storage; moreover, the sequence comparisons could be performed with higher speed. Phylogenetic trees of two sets of bacterial genomes were constructed and the results were in full agreement with their already constructed phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, a weighted and directed similarity network of each set of bacterial genomes was inferred ab initio by this model. Remarkably, the communities of these networks are in agreement with the clades of the corresponding phylogenetic trees which means these similarity networks also contain phylogenetic information about the genomes. Moreover, the block comparison method was used to distinguish rob(15;21)c-associated iAMP21 and sporadic iAMP21 rearrangements in subgroups of chromosome 21 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our results show a meaningful difference between the number of contigs that mapped to chromosomes 15 and 21 in these cases. Furthermore, the presented block alignment model can select the candidate blocks to perform more accurate analysis and it is capable to find conserved blocks on a set of genomes.","['Laboratory of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (LBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'School of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Laboratory of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (LBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Laboratory of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (LBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salacia impressifolia (Miers) A. C. Smith (family Celastraceae) is a traditional medicinal plant found in the Amazon Rainforest known as ""miraruira"", ""cipo-miraruira"" or ""panu"" and is traditionally used to treat dengue, flu, inflammation, pain, diabetes, male impotency, renal affections, rheumatism and cancer. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemia activity of the stem bark of S. impressifolia in experimental models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro cytotoxic activity of extracts, fractions and quinonemethide triterpenes (22-hydroxytingenone, tingenone and pristimerin) from the stem bark of S. impressifolia in cultured cancer cells was determined. The in vivo antitumor activity of the ethyl acetate extract (EAE) and of its fraction (FEAE.3) from the stem bark of S. impressifolia was assessed in C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice engrafted with human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. RESULTS: The extract EAE, its fraction FEAE.3, and quinonemethide triterpenes exhibited potent cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines, including in vitro anti-leukemia activity against HL-60 and K-562 cells. Moreover, extract EAE and its fraction FEAE.3 inhibited the in vivo development of HL-60 cells engrafted in C.B-17 SCID mice. Tumor mass inhibition rates were measured as 40.4% and 81.5% for the extract EAE (20mg/kg) and for its fraction FEAE.3 (20mg/kg), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract and its fraction from the stem bark of S. impressifolia exhibit in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemia activity that can be attributed to their quinonemethide triterpenes. These data confirm the ethnopharmacological use of this species and may contribute to the development of a novel anticancer herbal medicine.","['Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Department of Biomorphology, Institute of Health Sciences, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador (UFBA), Bahia 40110-902, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia 40296-710, Brazil; Center of Biotechnology and Cell Therapy, Hospital Sao Rafael, Salvador, Bahia 41253-190, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Amazonas 69077-000, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Amazonas 69077-000, Brazil.', 'Health and Biotechnology Institute, Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Coari, Amazonas 69460-000, Brazil.', 'Metabolomics and Mass Spectrometry Research Group, Amazonas State University (UEA), Manaus, Amazonas 690065-130, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia 40296-710, Brazil.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"Recent studies have shown that the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), but not ERbeta, is involved in the proinflammatory and propruritic responses in cutaneous allergy. In addition, results from our recent study showed that while oral administration of the rather ERbeta-selective agonist bisphenol A exacerbated the respiratory allergic inflammation, the potential inflammatory reaction in the skin was decreased after administration of bisphenol A. This study aimed to elucidate whether ERalpha and ERbeta are involved in the progression of an allergic airway inflammation. We performed an in vivo experiment using an animal model of allergic airway inflammation using male BALB/c mice to confirm an increase in the proinflammatory response induced by propylpyrazoletriol (PPT), an ERalpha agonist, and diarylpropionitrile (DPN), an ERbeta agonist. Oral administration of PPT or DPN showed a significant increase in the inflammation of the lung and infiltration of eosinophils. While the expression of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 was not affected by exposure to PPT or DPN, administration of these agonists significantly increased the expression of IL-33. The mechanism underlying the development of such allergic inflammatory responses was determined by an in vitro study using the human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) and the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line (EoL-1). Activated cells were exposed to PPT or DPN for 24 h, and the cytokine levels were measured. The IL-33 levels in BEAS-2B cells increased significantly after exposure to PPT or DPN. In addition, pretreatment with PPT or DPN increased the expression of IL-8 in activated EoL-1 cells. Our findings indicate that ERalpha and ERbeta are involved in the proinflammatory response in respiratory allergy, and their effects may be mediated by an increase in the expression of IL-33 and infiltration of eosinophils.","['The Institute of Environmental Toxicology, 4321, Uchimoriya-machi, Joso-shi, Ibaraki, 303-0043, Japan.

One possible factor behind this inability is the lack of studies utilizing aged rodents of both sexes. Previously, this lab showed that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promoted recovery after stroke through antioxidant enzyme upregulation. This study examined whether LIF promotes neuroprotection in aged rats of both sexes. LIF did not reduce tissue damage in aged animals, but LIF-treated female rats showed partial motor skill recovery. The LIF receptor (LIFR) showed membrane localization in young male and aged rats of both sexes after stroke. Although LIF increased neuronal LIFR expression in vitro, it did not increase LIFR in the aged brain. Levels of LIFR protein in brain tissue were significantly downregulated between young males and aged males/females at 72h after stroke. These results demonstrated that low LIFR expression reduces the neuroprotective efficacy of LIF in aged rodents of both sexes. Furthermore, the ability of LIF to promote motor improvement is dependent upon sex in aged rodents.","['Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky, 741 S.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"Graft-versus host disease (GVHD) remains the most significant complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Dissociation of graft versus-leukemia (GVL) activity from GVHD has yet to be achieved. In this study, we used gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSIs, DAPT) to inhibit Notch signaling in GVHD and GVL murine model. We found that CD11c(+)CD80(+) dendritic cells (DCs) were up-regulated but did not enhance GVHD. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and central memory T cells that express high levels of CD62L and CD44 had an expansion after Notch inhibition. Reduced Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha and increased Interferon-gamma production were found, which might be ascribed to the expansion of Tregs and central memory T cells, and result in increased sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. Fas Receptor-Fas Ligand interaction plays a critical role in GVL instead of aGVHD. Fas Ligand expressions were similar in recipients with or without Notch inhibition, suggesting that GVL activity was maintained. We showed that Notch inhibition could enhances GVL while reducing GVHD via modulating host DCs and donor T cell activity, and the production of inflammatory cytokines.","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510230, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510230, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510230, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510230, China.

The key to the latest CART therapy advances can be attributed to the improved costimulatory signals in the CAR design. METHODS: Here, we established several novel CARs by incorporating T cell signaling domains of CD28 in conjunction with intracellular signaling motif of 4-1BB, CD27, OX40, ICOS, and IL-15Ralpha. These novel CARs were functionally assessed based on a simple target cell killing assay. RESULTS: The results showed that the CD28/IL-15Ralpha co-signaling (153z) CAR demonstrated the fastest T cell expansion potential and cytotoxic activities. IL-15 is a key cytokine that mediates immune effector activities. The 153z CARTs maintained prolonged killing activities after repetitive rounds of target cell engagement. Consistent with the enhanced target killing function, the 153z CARTs produced increased amount of effector cytokines including IFN-gamma, TNFalpha and IL-2 upon interaction with the target cells. CONCLUSION: In a follow-up clinical study, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient, who experienced multiple relapses of central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) and failed all conventional therapies, was enrolled to receive the CD19-specific 153z CART treatment. The patient achieved complete remission after the 153z CART cell infusion. The translational outcome supports further investigation into the safety and enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the IL-15Ralpha-modified CART cells in cancer patients.","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Division of Hematology Oncology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Aerospace General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Geno-immune Medical Institute, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Geno-immune Medical Institute, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Division of Hematology Oncology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Geno-immune Medical Institute, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, United States.', 'Geno-immune Medical Institute, Shenzhen, China.', 'School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03050190', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03125577']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,"BACKGROUND: Posterior column ataxia retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP) with feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1) gene mutation is a rare disorder with significant ophthalmic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series study of patients diagnosed with PCARP and genetic testing positive for FLVCR1 mutation between 1 January 2015 and 1 October 2017 at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Clinical charts, visual fields, fundus autofluorescence, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were reviewed. RESULTS: Seven patients from three families were identified to have PCARP and FLVCR1 mutation. The median age at presentation was 13 years (range, 7-28 years). Common clinical exam findings were astigmatism, cataracts, and vitreous syneresis. Funduscopy on all patients revealed bull's eye maculopathy, retinal vessels attenuation, and bone spicule changes in the peripheral retina. Fundus autofluorescence showed bilateral hyperautofluorescent rings. SD-OCT demonstrated morphological changes, which differed based on age. The youngest sibling family exhibited peripheral loss, but subfoveal preservation of the outer retinal layers. These layers were lost in the oldest sibling family. Visual fields loss paralleled SD-OCT findings. CONCLUSION: There is limited published ophthalmic data on FLVCR1-related PCARP. We describe clinical and retinal imaging features in the one of the largest cohorts of affected patients in the literature. Given the availability of genetic testing for this phenotype, testing for FLVCR1 mutations should be considered in pediatric and adult patients with sensory ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa.","[""a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Strabismus, and Adult Motility , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA."", ""a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Strabismus, and Adult Motility , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA."", 'b Department of Ophthalmology , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA.', ""a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Strabismus, and Adult Motility , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA."", ""a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Strabismus, and Adult Motility , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA."", ""a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Strabismus, and Adult Motility , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA."", 'b Department of Ophthalmology , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA.', ""a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Strabismus, and Adult Motility , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA."", 'c Pediatrician , Central Pennsylvania Clinic for Special Children and Adults , Belleville , Pennsylvania , USA.', ""d Department of Pediatrics , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA."", ""a Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Strabismus, and Adult Motility , Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7430-8601'],20181116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of cancer increased in the following order: prostate, thyroid, liver, ovarian, lung, leukemia, skin, multiple myeloma, lymphoma and testicular. The severity and sex of psoriatic patients also had different cancer risks. In psoriatic patients, a slightly increased risk for specific malignant neoplasms was shown.

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"Alteration in RNA splicing is implicated in carcinogenesis and progression. Mutations in spliceosome genes and alternative splicing of other genes have been noted in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), a common B cell malignancy with heterogeneous outcomes. We previously demonstrated that differences in the amount of SET oncoprotein (a physiological inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A) is associated with clinical aggressiveness in patients with CLL. It is unknown if alternative splicing of gene transcripts regulating kinases and phosphatases affects disease pathobiology and CLL progression. We show here for the first time that mRNA levels of the alternatively spliced SET isoforms, SETA and SETB (SETalpha and SETbeta), significantly correlate with disease severity (overall survival and time-to-first-treatment) in CLL patients. In addition, we demonstrate that relative increase of SETA to SETB mRNA can discriminate patients with a more aggressive disease course within the otherwise favourable CLL risk classifications of IGHV mutated and favourable hierarchical fluorescence in situ hybridisation groups. We validate our finding by showing comparable relationships of SET mRNA with disease outcomes using samples from an independent CLL cohort from a separate institution. These findings indicate that alternative splicing of SET, and potentially other signalling cascade molecules, influences CLL biology and patient outcomes.","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9581-2807', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2938-5704']",20181115,"['Br J Haematol. 2019 Aug;186(4):638.

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are including the most important cytokines which have been associated with the biological behavioral and immune responses in malignancies. Based on the critical roles which these two cytokines play against tumor cells, the present study was aimed to investigate the genes expression level of IL6 and IFN-gamma in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and compare with normal controls. Fifty-two patients with ALL and 13 healthy volunteer were under studied. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all patients and normal controls were separated by ficoll. The expression of interferon gamma and interleukin 6 genes were determined by RQ-PCR. Finally all data were analyzes using T student, one way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests were use to analyze all samples data. Our finding showed that the level of IFN-gamma gene expression was significant decreased in patients with All as compared with healthy controls (83 change fold, p < 0.0001). The level of IL-6 Gene expression was not changeable in B-ALL patients as compared with healthy control (p = 0.4), but in T-ALL patients, was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). The results of present study indicated that IFN-gamma gene expression reduced in ALL patients. It provides a valuable insight that immune system may disrupted in patients with ALL, which cause tumor cells escape from immune surveillance.","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iran-Hemopoeitic Stem cell Research Centre (HSCRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iran-Hemopoeitic Stem cell Research Centre (HSCRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iran-Hemopoeitic Stem cell Research Centre (HSCRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iran-Hemopoeitic Stem cell Research Centre (HSCRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mohsenhp@sbmu.ac.ir.', 'Iran-Hemopoeitic Stem cell Research Centre (HSCRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mohsenhp@sbmu.ac.ir.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Taleghani General Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iran-Hemopoeitic Stem cell Research Centre (HSCRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,20181115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that fatty acid metabolism is a key energy pathway for survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in the adipocyte-abundant BM microenvironment. The novel fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) inhibitor avocatin B, an odd-numbered carbon lipid derived from the avocado fruit, induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in mono-cultured AML cells. In AML cells co-cultured with BM adipocytes, FAO inhibition with avocatin B caused adaptive stimulation of free fatty acid (FFA) uptake through upregulation of FABP4 mRNA, enhanced glucose uptake and switch to glycolysis. These changes reflect the compensatory response to a shortage of FFA supply to the mitochondria, and facilitate the protection of AML cells from avocatin B-induced apoptosis in the presence of BM adipocytes. However, the combination treatment of avocatin B and conventional anti-AML therapeutic agent cytarabine (AraC) increased reactive oxygen species and demonstrated highly synergistic effects on AML cells under BM adipocyte co-culture condition. These findings highlight the potential for combination regimens of AraC and FAO inhibitors that target bone marrow-resident chemoresistant AML cells.","['Departments of Next Generation Hematology Laboratory, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Leading Center for the Development Research of Cancer Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Leading Center for the Development Research of Cancer Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Proteomics and BioMolecular Science, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Proteomics and BioMolecular Science, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Proteomics and BioMolecular Science, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Proteomics and BioMolecular Science, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departtment of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. mkonoplev@mdanderson.org.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3734-0346'],20181115,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA206210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6237992,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed outcomes of 176 multiple myeloma (MM) patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2016, and who had CPCs detectable at diagnosis, to determine whether a lower threshold could be used to diagnose PCL. Median overall survival (mOS) was 1.1 years (95% CI 0.8-1.4) and was similar between patients with < 5% (n = 54, mOS = 1.4 years [0.7-2.0]), 5-19% (n = 63, mOS = 1.1 years [0.7-1.4]), and >/= 20% CPCs (n = 59, mOS = 1.1 years [0.7-1.5], p = 0.349). As survival was similar between those with 5-19% and >/= 20% CPCs, we stratified patients by < 5% (mOS = 1.4 years [0.7-2.0]) and >/= 5% CPCs (mOS = 1.1 years [0.8-1.4], p = 0.154). Outcomes of those with >/= 5% CPCs were much poorer when compared with a cohort of MM patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2016, who did not have CPCs at diagnosis (n = 9724, mOS = 4.4 yrs [4.3-4.5], p < 0.001); survival was also lower in patients diagnosed after 2001 with >/= 5% CPCs (n = 62, mOS = 1.4 years [0.8-2.5]) compared with patients with standard risk (n = 1326, mOS = 7.5 years [7.0-8.7]) and high-risk MM (n = 381, mOS = 4.3 years [3.5-4.9], p < 0.001).

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"In genetic screens aimed at understanding drug resistance mechanisms in chronic myeloid leukemia cells, inactivation of the cullin 3 adapter protein-encoding leucine zipper-like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1) gene led to enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity and reduced sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Knockdown of the Drosophila LZTR1 ortholog CG3711 resulted in a Ras-dependent gain-of-function phenotype. Endogenous human LZTR1 associates with the main RAS isoforms. Inactivation of LZTR1 led to decreased ubiquitination and enhanced plasma membrane localization of endogenous KRAS (V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog). We propose that LZTR1 acts as a conserved regulator of RAS ubiquitination and MAPK pathway activation. Because LZTR1 disease mutations failed to revert loss-of-function phenotypes, our findings provide a molecular rationale for LZTR1 involvement in a variety of inherited and acquired human disorders.","['CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Regenerative Biology and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1 Gustave L.

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with a highly heterogeneous disease course in terms of clinical outcomes and responses to chemoimmunotherapy. This heterogeneity is partly due to genetic aberrations identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells such as mutations of TP53 and/or deletions in chromosome 17p [del(17p)], resulting in loss of one TP53 allele. These aberrations are associated with markedly decreased survival and predict impaired response to chemoimmunotherapy thus being among the strongest predictive markers guiding treatment decisions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clinical trials demonstrate the importance of accurately testing for TP53 aberrations [both del(17p) and TP53 mutations] before each line of treatment to allow for appropriate treatment decisions that can optimize patients' outcomes. The current report reviews the diagnostic methods to detect TP53 disruption better, the role of TP53 aberrations in treatment decisions and current therapies available for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia carrying these abnormalities. The standardization in sequencing technologies for accurate identification of TP53 mutations and the importance of continued evaluation of TP53 aberrations throughout initial and subsequent lines of therapy remain unmet clinical needs as new therapeutic alternatives become available.","['Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, and CIBERONC, Spain.', 'Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP, UMR INSERMU978/Paris 13 University, Bobigny, France.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy ghia.paolo@hsr.it.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'University of Oxford, UK.', 'Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Germany and Innere Medizin I, Universitatsklinikum des Saarlandes, Homburg, Germany.']",,20181115,,,,,PMC6269313,,['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"Myelosuppression is a major and frequently dose-limiting side effect of anticancer therapy and is responsible for most treatment-related morbidity and mortality. In addition, repeated cycles of DNA damage and cell death of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, followed by compensatory proliferation and selection pressure, lead to genomic instability and pave the way for therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Protection of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from chemo- and radiotherapy in patients with solid tumors would reduce both immediate complications and long-term sequelae. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were reported to prevent chemo- or radiotherapy-induced myelosuppression in mice. We tested both molecules for potentially protective effects on human CD34(+) cells in vitro and established a xenograft mouse model to analyze stress resistance and regeneration of human hematopoiesis in vivo EGF was neither able to protect human stem and progenitor cells in vitro nor to promote hematopoietic regeneration following sublethal irradiation in vivo PGE2 significantly reduced in vitro apoptotic susceptibility of human CD34(+) cells to taxol and etoposide. This could, however, be ascribed to reduced proliferation rather than to a change in apoptosis signaling and BCL-2 protein regulation. Accordingly, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 (dmPGE2) did not accelerate regeneration of the human hematopoietic system in vivo Repeated treatment of sublethally irradiated xenograft mice with known antiapoptotic substances, such as human FLT3L and thrombopoietin (TPO), which suppress transcription of the proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins BIM and BMF, also only marginally promoted human hematopoietic regeneration in vivo.","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg.', 'Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center of Freiburg.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg miriam.erlacher@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",,20181115,,,,,PMC6442978,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,"The introduction of agents targeted at specific molecular events is changing the treatment paradigms in a number of malignancies. Historically, we have relied entirely on DNA-interactive, cytotoxic drugs for treating patients with leukemia. Increased understanding of the leukemic cell biology and pathogenesis, and the ways they evade the immune surveillance mechanisms, will likely lead to the development of more effective agents, and regimens less reliant on chemotherapy, able to achieve deep levels of disease eradication. In Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the introduction of increasingly potent tyrosine kinas inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized therapy. These drugs have been established as the cornerstone of any therapeutic strategy in this disease, and a number of trials have better defined the best ways to incorporate them into the established paradigms. Despite using TKIs, we have continued to remain reliant on cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant to achieve the best long-term outcomes. However, with the introduction of more potent TKIs and other novel agents, as well as better methods for monitoring minimal/measurable residual disease, we are entering an era where we hope to diminish our reliance on transplantation and cytotoxic chemotherapy in this disease.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",,20181115,,,,,PMC7042663,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"BACKGROUND: Monitoring of measurable residual disease (MRD) in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who achieve a morphological complete remission can predict haematological relapse. In this prospective study, we aimed to determine whether MRD-guided pre-emptive treatment with azacitidine could prevent relapse in these patients. METHODS: The relapse prevention with azacitidine (RELAZA2) study is an open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial done at nine university health centres in Germany. Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced MDS or AML, who had achieved a complete remission after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation, were prospectively screened for MRD during 24 months from baseline by either quantitative PCR for mutant NPM1, leukaemia-specific fusion genes (DEK-NUP214, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFb-MYH11), or analysis of donor-chimaerism in flow cytometry-sorted CD34-positive cells in patients who received allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation. MRD-positive patients in confirmed complete remission received azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) per day subcutaneously on days 1-7 of a 29-day cycle for 24 cycles. After six cycles, MRD status was reassessed and patients with major responses (MRD negativity) were eligible for a treatment de-escalation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were relapse-free and alive 6 months after the start of pre-emptive treatment. Analyses were done per protocol. This trial is registered with ClincialTrials.gov, number NCT01462578, and finished recruitment on Aug 21, 2018. FINDINGS: Between Oct 10, 2011, and Aug 20, 2015, we screened 198 patients with advanced MDS (n=26) or AML (n=172), of whom 60 (30%) developed MRD during the 24-month screening period and 53 (88%) were eligible to start study treatment. 6 months after initiation of azacitidine, 31 (58%, 95% CI 44-72) of 53 patients were relapse-free and alive (p<0.0001; one-sided binomial test for null hypothesis pexp</=0.3). With a median follow-up of 13 months (IQR 8.5-22.8) after the start of MRD-guided treatment, relapse-free survival at 12 months was 46% (95% CI 32-59) in the 53 patients who were MRD-positive and received azacitidine. In MRD-negative patients, 12-month relapse-free survival was 88% (95% CI 82-94; hazard ratio 6.6 [95% CI 3.7-11.8], p<0.0001). The most common (grade 3-4) adverse event was neutropenia, occurring in 45 (85%) of 53 patients. One patient with neutropenia died because of an infection considered possibly related to study treatment. INTERPRETATION: Pre-emptive therapy with azacitidine can prevent or substantially delay haematological relapse in MRD-positive patients with MDS or AML who are at high risk of relapse. Our study also suggests that continuous MRD negativity during regular MRD monitoring might be prognostic for patient outcomes.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between medical and social environmental factors and the risk of repeating a grade in childhood leukemia survivors. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of childhood leukemia survivors, recruited through the LEA cohort (Leucemie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent [French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study for Leukemia]) in 2014. An adjusted logistic regression model was used to identify variables linked to repeating a grade after the diagnosis among the survivors, and the rates of repeating a grade were compared between the survivors and their siblings using a multilevel logistic regression model. RESULTS: The mean age at inclusion of the 855 participants was 16.2 +/- 7.0 years, and the mean duration of follow-up from diagnosis to evaluation was 10.2 +/- 6.2 years. After disease onset, 244 patients (28.5%) repeated a grade, with a median interval of 4 years (IQR, 2-8 years). Independent factors associated with repeating a grade were male sex (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.21-2.60), adolescence (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.63-4.48), educational support during the treatment period (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.45-5.88), low parental education level (OR, 2.493; 95% CI, 1.657-3.750), and household financial difficulties (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.607-4.28). Compared with siblings, survivors were at greater risk of repeating a grade (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.48-2.35). CONCLUSIONS: The most vulnerable patients seemed to be adolescents and those with parents of low socioeconomic status. Improving the schooling career of leukemia survivors will require that the medical community more carefully consider the social status of patients.","['Department of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes1 University, Rennes, France.

Based on the published literature, it has a very sound ophthalmologic safety profile. In the following, we describe a case of anterior chamber fibrinoid syndrome in a patient on ibrutinib for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia after uncomplicated cataract extraction. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old white man with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia on ibrutinib therapy and without significant past ocular history presented 1 day after uncomplicated phacoemulsification with in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation with multiple, discrete, pigmented cords in the anterior chamber. His vision was 20/100 and intraocular pressure was 43 mmHg. There was no hypopyon, hyphema, or cellular reaction. The dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. He was diagnosed as having fibrinoid syndrome and started on topical prednisolone, brimonidine, timolol-dorzolamide, and orally administered acetazolamide. Within 2 weeks, the fibrin cords disappeared completely, vision improved to 20/30, and the intraocular pressure normalized off all medications. CONCLUSIONS: The precise etiology of fibrinoid syndrome remains unclear. This is the first case of fibrinoid syndrome in a patient on ibrutinib, which is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and induce intraocular changes. It is important to differentiate this syndrome from toxic anterior segment syndrome and endophthalmitis, and to initiate appropriate treatment. The fibrin bands tend to be exquisitely sensitive to topical steroids and to resolve within a few weeks without sequelae.","['Department of Ophthalmology, Scheie Eye Institute, University of Pennsylvania, 51 N. 39th St, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Scheie Eye Institute, University of Pennsylvania, 51 N. 39th St, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Scheie Eye Institute, University of Pennsylvania, 51 N. 39th St, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.

RESULTS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 99 patients diagnosed with CLL in Khartoum Oncology Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Immunophenotyping and CD38 expression levels were measured with four-color flowcytometry. The results of physical examination and blood analyses were used for assigning a modified Rai clinical staging system. The collected data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science, version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). According to our findings, the frequencies of 7%, 20%, and 30% cutoff levels of CD38 expressions were 68.7%, 41.4%, and 36.4% respectively. CD38 cutoff level of 7% showed a significant association with hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.04), whereas other cutoff levels showed insignificant results. All the three cutoff levels showed insignificant associations with the other clinical and laboratory variables. In conclusion, the CD38 expression at a cutoff level of 7% seems to be more valuable clinically than higher cutoff levels in Sudanese CLL patients.","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Al Neelain University, Khartoum, Sudan. enaamresearch@gmail.com.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Al Neelain University, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Khartoum Radioisotope Center, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory for Leukemia & Lymphoma Diagnosis, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory for Leukemia & Lymphoma Diagnosis, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Khartoum Radioisotope Center, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan.']",,20181115,,,,,PMC6238334,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the landscape of innovative compounds, inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO) is a promising drug, whose mechanism of action relies on the killing of CD22 positive leukemic cells, through the delivery, after cell binding, of a molecule of calicheamicin. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of CD22 positive relapsed EM-ALL treated with IO, obtained as compassionate use. Case 1, a 66 years old woman, affected by Philadelphia (Ph) negative B-ALL, relapsed with extramedullary involvement after 6 standard chemotherapy courses, who reached a complete metabolic response with IO treatment. Case 2, a 67 years old man with Ph positive B-ALL, initially treated with ponatinib, a third generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI), obtaining a prolonged deep molecular remission. Nevertheless, for skin relapse during TKI treatment, the patient received local radiotherapy and, shortly after, standard chemotherapy, as multiple abdominal sites of relapse were detected too, with no response. The patient then received IO, obtained as compassionate use, with a good metabolic response. CONCLUSIONS: These two cases suggest a possible key role of IO in the setting of advanced CD22 positive ALL, and underline its potential activity also in patients with EM involvement, relapsed after or refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Despite the well known hepatotoxic effect of the compound (Sinusoid Occlusive Syndrome), neither of them had such adverse event, moreover the second patient safely underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['DIMES (Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine), Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 141 patients with primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 8 patients with AML that developed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who were aged 19-81 years. DNA isolated from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was analyzed by PCR. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) was detected by amplification of exons 14 and 15. Point mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) were detected by digesting the PCR product of exon 20 with the restriction endonuclease EcoRV. Fragments were separated electrophoretically. PCR products of the positive samples were also analyzed using a microchip device (Bioanalyzer 2100). RESULTS: LT3-ITD and point mutations in the FLT-TKD were detected in 19 and 8% of patients, resp. Two patients (1%) harbored both types of mutations. Patients with and without FLT3 mutations were called FLT+ and FLT-, resp. Most FLT3+ patients had no chromosomal aberrations (59%) or harbored the t (15; 17) translocation in PML-RARA (15%). The mortality rate was 33% among FLT3+ patients and 10% among FLT3-patients. Among FLT3+ patients, the mortality rates of patients with FLT3-ITD and point mutations of the FLT-TKD were almost the same. A 77-year-old female patient with both FLT3-ITD and a point mutation in the FLT3-TKD was in remission. The eight patients who developed AML from MDS were assessed separately. Of these, three patients were FLT3+; two patients displayed FLT3-ITD, and one patient harbored a point mutation in the FLT3-TKD. No other genetic aberrations were detected. FLT3+ patients lived for longer than FLT3-patients. These analyses of FLT3 gene mutations in patients from eastern Slovakia are consistent with published data from other databases. CONCLUSION: The applied PCR method is reliable, relatively fast, and affordable, and can be used for routine monitoring of FLT3 gene mutations. FLT3 mutations can be verified using a microchip as an alternative to capillary electrophoresis.

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival outcomes of patients developing second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) after surviving childhood cancer in Korea. METHODS: Medical data of childhood cancer patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2012 were obtained from the Korea Central Cancer Registry. The risk of developing SMNs was calculated using standardized incidence ratio (SIR), excess absolute risk (EAR), and cumulative risk. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated, stratified by SMN status. RESULTS: A total of 28,405 childhood cancer patients were diagnosed in the study period, and 337 (1.2%) developed SMN. The total follow-up period was 197,359 person-years at risk (PYR), with a median follow-up duration of 5.6 years. Overall SIR was 20.0, which was 23.2 in women, and 17.6 in men. The overall EAR was 16.4 per 10,000 PYR. The most common types of SMNs, in order of incidence, were other malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. The cumulative incidence of developing SMNs was 0.7% at 5 years, 1.2% at 10 years, and 2% at 15 years. After primary cancer diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate of patients with SMNs was 65.1%, which was lower than the 73.4% in patients without SMN. After SMN diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate was 55.8%. CONCLUSION: Through this registry-based study of 5.6 years of follow up, childhood cancer survivors were found to be at 20-fold higher risk of developing a malignant neoplasm compared to the general population. The majority of malignant neoplasms are malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. Continued surveillance for assessing long-term risks, and guidance for appropriate long-term follow up of childhood cancer survivors, are needed.","['Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Cancer Survivor Branch, National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Cancer Registration and Statistics Branch, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Cancer Registration and Statistics Branch, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Registration and Statistics Branch, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9861-6740'],20181115,,,,,PMC6237355,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody-associated cerebellar ataxia is a well-established disorder of autoimmune origin, but there are no reports in the literature of its occurrence following allo-HCT. We describe a middle-aged woman with chronic GVHD after allo-HCT who presented with a rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome. Thorough investigation revealed only cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging and positive anti-GAD65 antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid suggesting the diagnosis of anti-GAD antibody-associated cerebellar ataxia. Despite prompt treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and rituximab, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, and she died 4 months later.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"Constitutive activation of FGFR1 as a result of chromosome translocations is responsible for the development of a hematopoietic stem cell disorder that progresses to AML. We have developed a syngeneic mouse model of BCR-FGFR1 driven AML and used RNASeq to define gene expression signatures associated with disease progression. The development of the leukemic stem cells (LSC) is associated with a profound downregulation of specific transcription factors that normally maintain stem cell quiescence as well as cell adhesion and motility gene sets related to confinement to the stem cell niche. A prominent feature of the LSCs is the upregulation of genes involved in T-cell function, activation, migration and development. Despite this apparent T-cell priming in the LSCs, however, the majority of these genes are subsequently inactivated in the leukemic blast cells that derive from them. These studies provide insights into the molecular etiology of development and progression of FGFR1 driven AML.","['The Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, 1410 Laney Walker Blvd., Augusta, GA 30912, United States.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) including NK cells (cytotoxic) and the recently identified ""helper"" ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3, play an important role in innate defenses against pathogens. Notably, they mirror analogous T cell subsets, regarding the pattern of cytokine produced, while the timing of their intervention is few hours vs days required for T cell-mediated adaptive responses. On the other hand, the effectiveness of ILC in anti-tumor defenses is controversial. The relevance of NK cells in the control of tumor growth and metastasis has been well documented and they have been exploited in the therapy of high risk leukemia in the haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation setting. In contrast, the actual involvement of helper ILCs remains contradictory. Thus, while certain functional capabilities of ILC1 and ILC3 may favor anti-tumor responses, other functions could rather favor tumor growth, neo-angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. In addition, ILC2, by secreting type-2 cytokines, are thought to induce a prevalent pro-tumorigenic effect. Finally, the function of both NK cells and helper ILCs may be inhibited by the tumor microenvironment, thus adding further complexity to the interplay between ILC and tumors.","[""Department of Immunology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy; Department of Pathology, Sacro Cuore Don Calabria, Negrar, VR, Italy.', ""Department of Immunology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital, 37024, Negrar, VR, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino Genova, Genoa, Italy; Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES) and Centre of Exellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino Genova, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Research and Diagnostics, Istituto G.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"Type I natural killer T (NKT) cells are attractive candidates for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we examined the characteristics of type I NKT cells in patients with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We first identified type I NKT cells as Valpha24-Jalpha18 and Vbeta11 double-positive CD3(+) lymphocytes. Using this method, we found that the adult B-cell ALL patients presented significantly lower level of type I NKT cells than the age- and sex-matching control subjects. The expression of IL-21 by type I NKT cells was then examined using intracellular flow cytometry, which showed that with alpha-GalCer stimulation, the adult B-cell ALL patients presented significantly lower level of IL-21(+) type I NKT cells than control subjects. By both flow cytometry and ELISA, we found that the vast majority of IL-21-expressing type I NKT cells expressed IL-21R, which was also reduced in adult B-cell ALL patients. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we demonstrated that IL-21R(+), but not IL-21R(-), type I NKT cells could promote the IFN-gamma, granzyme B, and perforin expression by CD8 T cells in an IL-21-dependent fashion. This type I NKT cell-mediated stimulatory effect was reduced in adult B-cell ALL patients than in control subjects. In addition, we observed a positive correlation between the frequency of IL-21R(+) type I NKT cells and the frequencies of IFN-gamma-, granzyme B-, and perforin-expressing circulating CD8 T cells in adult B-cell ALL patients directly ex vivo. Overall, this study identified an IL-21-related impairment in type I NKT cells from adult B-cell ALL patients.","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Longyan First Hospital, Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Longyan 364000, PR, China.

The purpose of our initiative was to reduce the percentage of proven or probable IFIs in patients with AML undergoing induction or reinduction chemotherapy at the University of Virginia Health System to 10% or less by June 2017, in concordance with national averages. METHODS:: A multidisciplinary team was formed to lead the comprehensive quality improvement (QI) initiative. The team generated both current process state and ideal process state workflow diagrams, a cause-and-effect diagram, and a Pareto diagram to determine the most relevant etiology for proven or probable IFIs in patients with AML undergoing induction or reinduction chemotherapy. RESULTS:: Analysis led to the creation of a program standardizing antifungal prophylaxis in this patient population, along with a suggested work-up for recalcitrant fevers. Through two tests of change (Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles 1 and 2), the QI initiative was able to effectively reduce the proven or probable IFI rate to 0% since program implementation in August 2016, thus surpassing both QI initiative goals and national rates of IFI. Mean length of stay (LOS) decreased by 3.4 days, and median intensive care unit LOS decreased by 2 days. CONCLUSION:: Creation of a standardized antifungal prophylaxis program led to a marked decrease in LOS and the proven or probable IFI rate of patients with AML undergoing induction or reinduction chemotherapy.","['University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Atlanta Cancer Care, Atlanta, GA; and Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.']",,20181115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis is typically based on the high number of morphologically characteristic lymphoid cells and finding of an abnormal immunophenotype by flow cytometry. Because of its relatively indolent clinical behavior, observation is often an appropriate therapy. Here we present a case of a 53-year-old male admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain. Blood examination revealed mild mycrocitic anemia and multiplied lactate dehydrogenase level. Abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly of 16 cm, with no lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspiration of bone marrow revealed hypocellular marrow with 50% of atypical lymphoid cells. There were 81% of atypical medium sized granular lymphocytes with irregularly shaped nuclei in peripheral blood, so the cytologic diagnosis was lymphoproliferative process. Bone marrow biopsy showed nodular and interstitial proliferation of small, partially atypical T lymphocytic cells positive for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD8, granzyme and TIA, and negative for hairy cell markers, CD10, MUM 1, bcl 1, CD4 and CD56. The finding was consistent with T-LGLL. Due to splenomegaly, the patient was treated with cyclosporine and gradually reduced dose of corticosteroids, leading to regression of splenomegaly and normalization of lactate dehydrogenase level.","['Department of Cytology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Centre, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Cytology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Centre, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Hematology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Centre, Zagreb, Croatia.']",,,,,,,PMC6531996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Partial Tandem Duplications of the MLL gene (MLL-PTD) has been reported in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not in MPN blast phase. The post-MPN AML developed adverse clinical outcomes, which showed no noticeable improvement over the past 15 years. Therefore, the mechanisms and therapeutic approaches of post-MPN AML need to be deeply studied. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this study, we present a JAK2V617F positive MPN patient who experienced fatigue and splenomegaly, transforming into JAK2V617F negative AML. DIAGNOSES: A diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia was made in MPN blast phase. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT). OUTCOMES: The patient achieved complete remission twice, but relapsed twice. Relapse-free survival was only 3 months. She died about 24 months after her diagnosis. LESSONS: MLL-PTD occurs in the progression of JAK2V617F positive MPN into JAK2V617F negative AML, which may be a novel mechanism of MPN blast phase and helpful for post-MPN AML diagnosis. Allo-SCT may be a good choice for post-MPN AML with MLL-PTD. More therapeutic strategies need to be explored for a better prognosis in these patients.","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou, China.']",,,,,,,PMC6257502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment options are limited and there are no effective prevention strategies. This review focuses on mechanisms of leukemic transformation in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), the two most common types of congenital neutropenia. RECENT FINDINGS: AML/MDS that develops in the setting of congenital neutropenia has distinct molecular features. Clonal hematopoiesis because of TP53 mutations is seen in nearly 50% of patients with SDS, but is not seen in patients with SCN. Accordingly, there is a very high frequency of TP53 mutations in AML/MDS arising in the setting of SDS but not SCN. The rate of mutation accumulation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from patients with congenital neutropenia is not increased. SUMMARY: Both HSC cell-intrinsic and noncell-intrinsic changes contribute to the development of clonal hematopoiesis in congenital neutropenia and likely accounts for the high rate of leukemic transformation. In SCN, the persistently high levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor drive expansion of HSCs carrying truncation mutations of CSF3R. In SDS, impaired ribosome biogenesis induces p53-mediated growth inhibition and drives expansion of HSCs carrying TP53 mutations.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.']",,,,,"['P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA194552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL131655/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6447304,,,,,['NIHMS1525578'],,,,,,,,,

During treatment, bone complications (pain, osteopenia, fracture, avascular necrosis, ...) are also reported. In order to describe bone involvement (BI) of pediatric LLA, we reviewed the records of 104 patients followed in our unit. The overall incidence of BI was 67 %. At diagnosis, 50 % of patients had BI and in 19 %, the diagnosis of ALL was delayed. During and after treatment, respectively 28 % and 37 % of patients presented bone complications (pain, fractures, avascular necrosis, osteopenia). Patients with BI had a lower leukocytosis inferior to 10x109/l (p = 0.005) and an ALL of average risk (p = 0.019). 38 % of patients with BI during treatment were over 10 years old and 55 % were girls (vs. 21 % and 38 % in the entire cohort, respectively). Osteoporosis was more severe at diagnosis than during treatment, suggesting the presence of constitutional promoting factors.

To understand the important roles of P5 in cancer cells, the present study examined its expression on the surface of normal and cancer cell lines by flow cytometry using an affinitypurified antiP5 antibody labeled with 6(fluorescein5carboxamido) hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester. P5 expression was increased on the surface of various cancer cell lines, including leukemia cells, and glioblastoma, breast, colon, ovarian and uterine cervical cancer cells, compared with normal cells. However, P5 was constantly expressed within both normal and cancer cell lysates, and its total expression levels were not significantly different between the cells. P5 knockdown in glioblastoma cells by small interfering RNA affected Bip promoter activation during cancer cell growth, and significantly inhibited cancer cell growth and migration. Immunoprecipitation using an antiP5 antibody in cancer and normal cells demonstrated that vimentin was bound to P5, predominantly in U251 glioblastoma cells. P5 knockdown in glioblastoma cells did not affect the protein expression levels of vimentin; however, it did affect the expression of numerous epithelialmesenchymal transition markers, including Snail and Slug. These results suggested that P5 may serve an important role in cancer cell growth, and may be considered an attractive and potent target for the treatment of glioblastoma.","['Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.']",,20181115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) plays important roles in tumorigenic and developmental processes of various types of cancers. However, the expression of PLZF in gastric cancer (GC) has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression level and potential status of PLZF in GC as well as its possible mechanism. In the present study, we found that PLZF was downregulated in the majority of GC cell lines and tumor tissues and that alteration of PLZF expression was closely correlated with a malignant phenotype, epithelialmesenchymal transformation and overall survival. Evaluation of in vitro proliferation, colony information, migration and invasion indicated that PLZF gene transduction induced a less malignant phenotype, which was also confirmed through in vivo studies performed in athymic nude mice. Furthermore, we assessed the expression levels of the lncRNA ANRIL in GC and found that it was negatively associated with the level of PLZF and that ANRIL indirectly methylated PLZF to suppress its expression via binding with polycomb repressive complex 2. When GC cells were treated with the methylation inhibitor 5Aza2'deoxycytidine, the expression of PLZF increased, which further confirmed that PLZF was methylated. These results indicated that constitutive ANRIL activation was a possible cause of the lack of PLZF expression in GC cells. Coupled deregulation of PLZF and ANRIL may account for most of the alterations described in GC, and PLZF may become a potential target of GC therapy.","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, Anhui 233004, P.R.

It has been found to have the properties of a homodimer by manifesting depalmitoylation as well as lysophospholipase activity. LYPLAs are under the control of both microRNAs, miR138 and miR424. They were observed to be significantly overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. To date, LYPLAs are the sole enzymes recognized to activate depalmitoylation. In this study, we provide the expression pattern of LYPLA1 in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using four different NSCLC cell lines. Western blot analysis and RTPCR were performed to detect the protein expression and mRNA expression of LYPLA1 in NSCLC cell lines. We detected the highest LYPLA1 protein expression level in SPCA1 cells followed by A549 cells, and the highest LYPLA1 mRNA expression level was detected in the SPCA1 cells followed by the H1299 cell line. We found that suppression of LYPLA1 expression using smallinterfering RNA significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of the LYPLA1transfected NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we explored the involvement of LYPLA1 in the regulation of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). The epithelial marker Ecadherin was significantly increased, while mesenchymal markers Ncadherin, vimentin and SNAIL were markedly decreased in the LYPLA1silenced cells. Collectively the results of the present study suggest that the LYPLA1 gene plays a tumorpromotor role in NSCLC cells in vitro.","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, P.R.

Epub 2018 Nov 6.,"Resistance to Adriamycin (ADR) is an increasing problem in the treatment of leukemia and the development of novel therapeutic strategies is becoming increasingly important. Olaparib is a poly (adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase (PARP) 1 inhibitor, which has promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer and germline BRCA mutations. Previously published studies have indicated that Olaparib is able to overcome drug resistance in cancer; however, its underlying mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanism underlying resensitization. Annexin Vpropidium iodide staining indicated that the percentage of apoptotic ADR resistant cells was markedly increased and the cell cycle was blocked at the G2/Mphase following treatment with ADR combined with Olaparib, when compared with the control group. The alkaline comet assay demonstrated that ADR combined with Olaparib significantly upregulated the induction of the DNA damage response in ADRresistant cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the protein expression of gammaH2A histone family member X, cleaved PARP, caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 was markedly enhanced, while the cell cycleassociated protein cyclin B1 was downregulated in K562/ADR cells following treatment with a combination of ADR and Olaparib. Similar synergistic cytotoxicity was observed in blood mononuclear cells, which were isolated from patients with chemotherapyresistant leukemia. As Olaparib is available for clinical use, the results of the present study provide a rationale for the development of Olaparib combinational therapies for cases of ADR resistant leukemia.","['Department of Hematology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, P.R.

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most often diagnosed hematological malignant tumors in the Western world and a type of inert Bcell lymphoma that commonly attacks the elderly. Small ubiquitin related modifier (SUMO)specific protease 2 (SENP2) can act as a suppressor in various types of cancer by regulating the stability of betacatenin to affect the Notch signaling pathway; however, it has a low expression level in CLL cells. In this study, we firstly used western blot analysis and RTqPCR to detect the protein and mRNA expression levels of SENP2 in the peripheral blood of patients with CLL and healthy volunteers. Secondly, we overexpressed or knocked down the expression of SENP2 in CLL cells and then determined the cell invasive and chemotactic ability in a Transwell assay and chemotaxis assay. We examined the sensitivity of the cells to cytarabine and dexamethasone via a CCK8 assay and determined the cell apoptotic condition and the expression of the Notch signaling pathway using flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that the patients with CLL had relatively low expression levels of SENP2. The overexpression of SENP2 in the CLL cells decreased their invasive and proliferative ability, as well as their chemotactic response and enhanced their sensitivity to cytarabine and dexamethasone, while it promoted cell apoptosis. The silencing of SENP2 in the CLL cells generally produced the opposite results. We thus hypothesized that the overexpression of SENP2 downregulated betacatenin expression, thus inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway in CLL cells. Moreover, the nuclear factor (NF)kappaB signaling pathway was also regulated by the overexpression of SENP2. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate tha SENP2 can act as a tumor suppressor in CLL cells, and may thus prove to be a novel target for CLL treatment in clinical practice.","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignant clonal proliferative disorder of B cells. Inhibition of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are the main pathological causes of this disease, but its molecular mechanism requires further investigation. The purpose of the present study was to identify biomarkers for the early diagnosis and treatment of CLL, and to explore the molecular mechanisms of CLL progression. A total of 488 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 32 differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs; DEMs) for CLL were identified by analyzing the gene chips GSE22529, GSE39411 and GSE62137. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs demonstrated that DEGs were mainly involved in transcriptional dysregulation and multiple signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factorkappaB and mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathways. In addition, Cytoscape software was used to visualize the proteinprotein interactions of these DEGs in order to identify hub genes, which could be used as biomarkers for the early diagnosis and treatment of CLL. Cytoscape software was also used to analyze the association between the predicted target mRNAs of DEMs and DEGs and increase knowledge about the miRNAmRNA regulatory network associated with the progression of CLL. Taken together, the present study provided a bioinformatics basis for advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of CLL by identifying differentially expressed hub genes, miRNAmRNA target pairs and molecular pathways. In addition, hub genes may be used as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of CLL and to guide the selection of CLL drug combinations.","['College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong 250014, P.R.

With the biological investigations of these modifiers, some of them are identified as promoters in the process of various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and virus infection. Epigenetic changes may serve as potential ""first hits"" for tumorigenesis. Hence, targeting epigenetic modifiers is being considered as a promising way for disease treatment. To date, six agents in two epigenetic target classes (DNMT and HDAC) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Most of these drugs are applied in leukemia, lymphoma therapy, or are combined with other drugs for the treatment of solid tumor.

Impacts from this painting helped to create a sensitivity for analyzing naturally occurring video recordings, including moments when patients' subjective experiences are raised and responded to. Analysis begins with how a melanoma patient's facial expression bears striking resemblance to the painting, vocal and other visible social actions (e.g., gaze, gesture), and how patient's story about a friend's metastatic cancer reveals her primal fears and hopes about cancer. Actions displayed by other patients (breast, testicular, abdominal, and leukemia) are also examined to unmask how their faces and bodies make cancer visible, doctors' responses, and the complexities of how patients' stressful stories get constructed. Implications are raised for improving patient-provider relationships by offering more personalized care. Understanding how patients display their concerns and emotions, through spoken and embodied actions, enhances discernment about how best to provide tailored and supportive responses to patients' life-world experiences especially, but not exclusively, when dealing with the stresses and angst of cancer.","['School of Communication, Center for Communication, Health, & the Public Good, SDSU/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program in Public Health, San Diego State University.', 'Department of Surgery, Moores Cancer Center, University of California.']",,20181115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to characterize the nutrition care for critically ill patients with AL. We completed a retrospective review of adults with AL admitted to the Medical/Surgical ICU >24 hours. Descriptive statistics were performed on collected data including: demographics, APACHE II and Nutric scores, nutrition therapy, reasons for withholding nutrition, and mortality status at discharge. Data were collected on 154 AL patients with an average APACHE II score of 27 and Nutric score of 5.96. ICU mortality was 36%. Enteral nutrition (EN) was most commonly prescribed. Patients on EN received 55% of energy and 51% of protein prescribed. EN was commonly withheld for airway management and gastrointestinal impairment. Patients with AL received low amounts of energy and protein in the ICU and had a high Nutric score. Strategies and barriers to improve protein intake in this population are identified.","['a Departments of Clinical Nutrition and Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON.', 'b Department of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON.', 'c Department of Medicine and Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON.']",,20181115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a white blood cell (WBC) differential counting system for detecting abnormal cells using FCM incorporating 10 colors and 11 antibodies in a single tube, called ""10-color LeukoDiff,"" and evaluated its performance. METHODS: Ninety-one EDTA-anti-coagulated peripheral blood samples from 76 patients were analyzed using 10-color LeukoDiff. We compared 10 color LeukoDiff results with the results of manual differential count (manual diff). WBCs were classified into 17 cell populations: neutrophils, total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, CD5 and CD19 co-expressing lymphocytes, natural killer cells, total monocytes, 16+ monocytes, eosinophils, immature granulocytes, basophils, myeloblasts, B-blasts, T-blasts, myeloid antigen-positive B-blasts, CD19- plasma cells, and 19+ plasma cells. RESULTS: The correlations between the 10-color LeukoDiff and manual diff results were strong (r>0.9) for mature neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, immature granulocytes, and blasts and moderate for monocytes and basophils (r=0.86 and 0.74, respectively). There was no discrepancy in blast detection between 10-color LeukoDiff and manual diff results. Furthermore, 10-color LeukoDiff could differentiate the lineage of the blasts and separately count chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells and multiple myeloma cells. CONCLUSIONS: The 10-color LeukoDiff provided an accurate and comprehensive WBC differential count. The most important ability of 10-color LeukoDiff is to detect blasts accurately. This system is clinically useful, especially for patients with hematologic diseases, such as acute leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Application of this system will improve the development of FCM gating strategy designs.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Ansan University, Ansan, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. hankja@catholic.ac.kr.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4960-3403'],,,,"['10049771/Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy']",,PMC6240530,['No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.'],['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement in Korean T-ALL patients by fragment analysis, examining frequency, association between clinicopathologic characteristics and TCR clonality, and feasibility for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD). METHODS: In 51 Korean patients diagnosed as having T-ALL, TCR rearrangement was analyzed using the IdentiClone TCR gene clonality assay (InVivoScribe Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA) from archived bone marrow specimens. Limit of detection (LOD) and clonal stability at relapse were evaluated. The association between clinical prognosis and TCR clonality was examind by age and immunophenotypic classification. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (74.5%) had 62 clonal products of TCRbeta, TCRgamma, and/or TCRdelta rearrangements at diagnosis. Children with T-ALL (<12 years) showed a higher frequency of clonality (93.8%) than adolescents/adults (65.7%; >/=12 years). Patients with a mature immunophenotype (84.4%) showed a relatively higher frequency of clonality than those with the immature immunophenotype (57.9%). Survival and event-free survival were not influenced by immunophenotype or TCR clonality. The LOD was 1%. Clonal evolution at the relapse period was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The overall detection rate of TCR clonality was 74.5%. Survival did not differ by TCR clonality or immunophenotype and age group. Fragment analysis of TCR rearrangement cannot be used to assess MRD due to low sensitivity. Further research on the relationship between prognosis and frequency of TCR rearrangements is needed, using more sensitive methods to detect clonality and monitor MRD.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, Korea. iskim0710@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, Korea. cchl@pusan.ac.kr.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Green Cross Genome, Yongin, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Center for Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Hematologic Oncology Clinic, Center for Specific Organs Cancer Research Institute & Hospital, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Hematologic Oncology Clinic, Center for Specific Organs Cancer Research Institute & Hospital, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7243-9173', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9117-4919']",,,,"['30-2015-030/Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital', 'Pusan National University']",,PMC6240512,['There are no conflicts of interest to declare.'],['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,"OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a neoplastic disease whose genetic and cytogenetic changes play important roles in prognosis and treatment strategies. Philadelphia (Ph) translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) is a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in CML. METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched for English language articles from 1975 to 2017 containing the terms CML; Additional chromosomal abnormalities; Philadelphia translocation; Prognosis; and Treatment. DISCUSSION: Approximately 10-12% of CML patients exhibit additional chromosomal aberrations (ACAs) in chronic phase and blast crisis. ACAs emergence may cause different features in CML patients according to Ph pattern. For instance, deletion of chromosome 9 derivation is associated to patient's bad survival, whereas monosomy 7 develops myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CML patients with Ph-negative pattern. And ACAs in Ph-positive CML is considered as a failure in the management of CML with imatinib. CONCLUSION: CML classification using different features such as Ph and ACAs can play a decisive role in the evaluation of treatment responses in patients, for example, CML patients with Ph negative and monosomy 7 develop MDS or CML patient -Y and extra copy of Ph have a good response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, therefore, classifications according to Ph and ACAs play an important role in choosing better treatment protocols and therapeutic strategies. Karyotype analysis in CML patients with complex karyotype shows unrandom pattern so ACAs can be great clue in medical guidelines.","['Research Center of Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Golestan Hospital Clinical Research Development Unit, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'ER045, Laboratory of Stem Cells, DSST, Biology Department, Faculty of Sciences, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Research Center of Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8621-5904'],20181114,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with distinct immunologic phenotypes of ALL and characteristic outcomes. Aims: The present study was primarily aimed at analyzing the impact of cytogenetics on postinduction responses and event-free survival (EFS) in pediatric patients with ALL. The secondary objective was to study the overall survival (OS). Subjects and Methods: A total of 240 patients with age <18 years and diagnosed with ALL between January 2011 and June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Cytogenetics was evaluated with conventional karyotyping or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Based on cytogenetic abnormalities, the patients were grouped into five categories, and the outcomes were analyzed. Results: Of the 240 patients, 125 (52%) patients had evaluable cytogenetics. Of these, 77 (61.6%) patients had normal cytogenetics, 19 (15.2%) had t(9;22) translocation, 10 (8%) had unfavorable cytogenetics which included t(9;11), hypodiploidy, and complex karyotype, 10 (8%) had favorable cytogenetics which included t(12;21), t(1;19), and high hyperdiploidy, 9 (7.2%) had miscellaneous cytogenetics. Seventy-one percent of patients were treated with MCP 841 protocol, while 29% of patients received BFM-ALL 95 protocol. The 3-year EFS and OS of the entire group were 52% and 58%, respectively. On univariate analysis, EFS and OS were significantly lower in t(9;22) compared to normal cytogenetics (P = 0.033 and P = 0.0253, respectively) and were not significant for other subgroups compared to normal cytogenetics. On multivariate analysis, EFS was significantly lower for t(9;22) and unfavorable subgroups.

The Sokal, Euro and EUTOS risk scores were established to prognosticate the patients on therapy. Aim: To perform a comparative assessment of the Sokal, Euro and EUTOS prognostic score in Indian CML-CP patients on imatinib. Methods: This is a retrospective study performed in 260 Ph+ CML-CP patients who were administered oral imatinib (400 mg/day). Results: 166/260 were males and 94/260 were females (M: F::1.6:1) with median age 35 years (range 20-70). 92 (35.38%), 125 (48.07%) and 43 (16.5%) patients were divided into low, intermediate and high risk Sokal score respectively. 102 (39.23%), 106 (40.76%) and 52 (20%) patients were discriminated into low, intermediate and high risk Euro score respectively. 210 (80.7%) and 50 (19.2%) patients were divided into low and high risk EUTOS score. Cumulative incidence of MMR for low, intermediate and high-risk Sokal score was 87%, 76% and 84% respectively (P = 0.016). Incidence of MMR in low, intermediate and high-risk Euro score was 93%, 85% and 68% respectively (P = 0.001). Incidence of MMR was 80 % and 81% for low and high risk EUTOS score (P = 0.764). Both EFS and OS are significantly correlated with Sokal score (P = 0.004, P = 0.007) and Euro score (P = 0.009, P = 0.001) but not with EUTOS score (P = 0.581, P = 0.927). Conclusion: The present study highlights the significant prognostic role of Sokal and Euro score in predicting the treatment outcome of the CML- CP patients on imatinib.","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",,,,,,,PMC6190386,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have (i) identified the aberrant antigenic pattern of CD44 and its isoform CD44v6 in T-ALL; (ii) tested the association with different T-cell subtypes and genomic alterations; (iii) identified the impact of CD44 status in T-ALL outcome. Samples from 184 patients (123 T-ALL and 61 AML; <19 years) were analyzed throughout multiparametric flow cytometry. Mutations in N/KRAS, NOTCH1, FBXW7 as well as STIL-TAL1 and TLX3 rearrangements were detected using standard molecular techniques. CD44 expression was characterized in all T-ALL and AML cases. Compared with AML samples in which the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was 79.1 (1-1272), T-ALL was relatively low, with MFI 43.2 (1.9-1239); CD44v6 expression was rarely found, MFI 1 (0.3-3.7). T-ALL immature subtypes (mCD3/CD1a(neg)) had a lower CD44 expression, MFI 57.5 (2.7-866.3), whereas mCD3/TCRgammadelta(pos) cases had higher expressions, MFI 99.9 (16.4-866.3). NOTCH1 (mut) and STIL-TAL1 were associated with low CD44 expression, whereas N/KRAS (mut) and FBXW7 (mut) cases had intermediate expression. In relation to clinical features, CD44 expression was associated with tumor infiltrations (p = 0.065). However, no association was found with initial treatment responses and overall survival prediction. Our results indicate that CD44 is aberrantly expressed in T-ALL being influenced by different genomic alterations. Unraveling this intricate mechanism is required to place CD44 as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",,20181031,,,,,PMC6220090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of thirteen compounds showed strong antioxidant and cytotoxic effects on human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Several compounds exerted good cytotoxic activities on cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells. The treatment of HeLa cells with IC50 and double IC50 concentrations of the compounds 5a, 5c, 5f, and 5m induced a statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells within a subG1 cell cycle phase. The examined compounds caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells. Each of these compounds triggered apoptosis in HeLa cells through activation of caspase-3, the main effector caspase, caspase-8, which is involved in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and caspase-9, which is involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. All of the examined compounds decreased the expression levels of MMP2 in HeLa cells and levels of protumorigenic miR-133b. Compounds 5a and 5m lowered the expression level of oncogenic miR-21 in HeLa cells. In addition, compounds 5a, 5f, and 5m decreased the expression levels of oncogenic miR-155 while the treatment of HeLa cells with compounds 5a, 5c, and 5f increased expression of tumor-suppressive miR-206. Observed effects of these compounds on expression levels of four examined miRNAs suggest their prominent cancer-suppressive activity. An investigation by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy showed more efficient calf thymus DNA binding activity of the compound 5m in comparison to other tested compounds. Results of a pUC19 plasmid cleavage study and comet assay showed DNA damaging activities of compounds 5a and 5c.","['Faculty of Science , Department of Chemistry , University of Kragujevac , R.

An increase in the CD14(++)CD16(-) classical monocyte fraction >/= 94% of the total monocytes was proposed to rapidly and efficiently distinguish chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from reactive monocytosis. The robustness of this assay required a multicenter validation. The flow cytometry assay designed to quantify peripheral blood monocyte subsets was implemented by multiple diagnosis laboratories in France. A nationwide survey was performed to evaluate its performance. All the 48 French laboratories answered the questionnaire, revealing that 63% use this assay routinely. Central blind reanalysis of 329 cytometry files collected from five laboratories demonstrated an excellent correlation in classical monocyte fraction measurement (r = 0.93; p < 0.0001). The cutoff value of 94% classical monocytes being the critical readout for diagnosis, we then compared 115 patients with classical monocytes >/= 94% and 214 patients with a fraction < 94% between initial analysis and reanalysis. An agreement was obtained in 311 files. Finally, an overt diagnosis, available for 86 files, confirmed a good sensitivity (93.6%) and specificity (89.7%). This survey demonstrates the robustness of the flow assay with limited variability of classical monocyte percentage between centers, validates the 94% cutoff value, and confirms its sensitivity and specificity.","[""Departement d'hematologie et immunologie biologiques, APHP, Hopitaux universitaires Henri-Mondor, Creteil, France."", 'INSERM U955, Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-universitaire Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-universitaire Dijon, Dijon, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalier de la Cote Basque, Bayonne, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'INSERM UMR1170, Universite Paris-Sud, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM UMR1170, Universite Paris-Sud, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. dorothee.selimoglubuet@gustaveroussy.fr.', ""Departement d'hematologie et immunologie biologiques, APHP, Hopitaux universitaires Henri-Mondor, Creteil, France. orianne.wagnerballon@aphp.fr."", 'INSERM U955, Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France. orianne.wagnerballon@aphp.fr.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9071-6683'],20181114,,,,,PMC6235983,,,,,,,['Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM)'],,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which CALR mutations cause myeloid transformation are incompletely defined. We used mass spectrometry proteomics to identify CALR-mutant interacting proteins. Mutant CALR caused mislocalization of binding partners and increased recruitment of FLI1, ERP57, and CALR to the MPL promoter to enhance transcription. Consistent with a critical role for CALR-mediated JAK/STAT activation, we confirmed the efficacy of JAK2 inhibition on CALR-mutant cells in vitro and in vivo. Due to the altered interactome induced by CALR mutations, we hypothesized that CALR-mutant MPNs may be vulnerable to disruption of aberrant CALR protein complexes. A synthetic peptide designed to competitively inhibit the carboxy terminal of CALR specifically abrogated MPL/JAK/STAT signaling in cell lines and primary samples and improved the efficacy of JAK kinase inhibitors. These findings reveal what to our knowledge is a novel potential therapeutic approach for patients with CALR-mutant MPN.","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, and.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",,20181115,,,"['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6302938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,"PURPOSE: The aberrantly upregulated Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) is closely correlated with the malignant phenotype of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It is interesting to note that the CRISPR gene knockout by Cas9 gRNAs that target the FLI1 coding region and the posttranscriptional knockdown by shRNAs that target the 3' region of FLI1 mRNA yielded distinct antimetastasis effects in SCLC cells. This study attempts to examine if FLI1 exonic circular RNAs (FECR) function as a new malignant driver that determines the metastatic phenotype in SCLC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The clinical relevance of FECRs was examined in 56 primary SCLC tissues and 50 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. The prognostic value of FECRs was examined by measuring serum exosomal FECRs in a longitudinal cohort of patients with SCLC. The oncogenic activity of FECRs was investigated in both SCLC cell lines and animal xenograft studies. Finally, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying these noncoding RNAs as a malignant driver. RESULTS: Therapeutic comparison of CRISPR Cas9 knockout and shRNA knockdown of FLI1 identified FECRs as a new noncanonical malignant driver in SCLC. Using RNA FISH and quantitative PCR, we found that FECR1 (exons 4-2-3) and FECR2 (exons 5-2-3-4) were aberrantly upregulated in SCLC tissues (P < 0.0001), and was positively associated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.01). Notably, serum exosomal FECR1 was associated with poor survival (P = 0.038) and clinical response to chemotherapy. Silencing of FECRs significantly inhibited the migration in two highly aggressive SCLC cell lines and reduced tumor metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we uncovered that FECRs sequestered and subsequently inactivated tumor suppressor miR584-3p, leading to the activation of the Rho Associated Coiled-Coil Containing Protein Kinase 1 gene (ROCK1). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies FLI1 exonic circular RNAs as a new oncogenic driver that promotes tumor metastasis through the miR584-ROCK1 pathway. Importantly, serum exosomal FECR1 may serve as a promising biomarker to track disease progression of SCLC.","['Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, California.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, California.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China. cuijw@jlu.edu.cn jifan@stanford.edu alli@ncba.ac.cn.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China. cuijw@jlu.edu.cn jifan@stanford.edu alli@ncba.ac.cn.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, California.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China. cuijw@jlu.edu.cn jifan@stanford.edu alli@ncba.ac.cn.']",,20181114,,,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,"The treatment landscape for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is rapidly evolving. Targeted agents (TAs) have demonstrated impressive single agent activity and therefore have been replacing chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Despite their efficacy, the optimal use of the current TAs remains challenging. Perhaps the major dilemma is whether these drugs are best used in sequence or in combinations. Most patients tolerate TA well, notably early during treatment; however, a substantial number discontinue therapy because of toxicities. Therefore, the reasons for discontinuation and, subsequently, the preferred sequence of these agents become critical issues. Although TA monotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of CLL, residual disease, acquired resistance, suboptimal durability of response in patients with high-risk disease, indefinite treatment duration, and decreased compliance over time are issues of concern. To address these challenges, an increasing number of studies are evaluating different combinations of TAs; however, these studies have been mostly small single arm trials in heterogeneous patient populations using different methods for response assessment. A number of questions remain regarding the predictive value of minimal residual disease (MRD) status, durability of response, fixed treatment durations, and importantly, criteria for selection of patients for the optimal combinations. Medical comorbidities, performance status, prior therapies, and disease risk profile are fundamental in determining the treatment plan for each individual patient. Furthermore, utilizing prognostic and predictive markers along with monitoring MRD can guide the development of individualized, better-tolerated, time-limited, and potentially curative chemo-free treatment regimens.","['Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC; and.', 'CLL Program, Leukemia Service, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC; and.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2787-3867', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8724-1875', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9255-7655']",20181114,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7265785,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term disease control on TKI therapy has been the goal and expectation for most patients. More recently, treatment-free remission (TFR) has entered mainstream practice and is increasingly being adopted as the main goal of therapy. This therapeutic shift not only influences TKI selection but also, has necessitated the refinement and dissemination of highly sensitive and accurate molecular monitoring techniques. Measurement of BCR-ABL1 messenger RNA expression through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, reported according to the International Scale, has become the primary tool for response assessment in CML. Achieving specific time-dependent molecular milestones, as defined by global therapeutic guidelines, has been established as critical in maximizing optimal outcomes while identifying patients at risk of therapy failure. Depth and duration of a deep molecular response have become the new therapeutic targets in patients considered for TFR. Consequently, molecular monitoring in CML has become even more critical to ongoing response assessment, identifying patients with TKI resistance and poor drug adherence, and enabling TFR to be attempted safely and effectively.","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; and.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; and.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 26.,"ADAM28 has been shown to relate with tumor proliferation and prognosis. The expression of ADAM28 is up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the mechanism by which ADAM28 regulates the leukemic cell and the prognostic relevance with AML remain unknown. Here, we found that the expression level of ADAM28 was significantly elevated in AML patients suffering a relapse compared with those remaining in complete remission (CR). ADAM28 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion in leukemic cells in vitro. Additionally, the increased expression of ADAM28 led to more IGFBP-3 degradation and IGF-I-induced cell proliferation. In a xenotransplantation mouse model, knockout of ADAM28 alleviated HL-60cells growth and dissemination. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was significantly higher in patients with high ADAM28 expression. When separately considering the impact of ADAM28 on prognosis within the risk stratifications, patients with high ADAM28 expression levels had a significantly higher CIR in the favorable and intermediate-risk group but not in poor-risk group. Taken together, these data suggest a pivotal role for ADAM28 in regulating the proliferation and invasion of leukemic cells and in the prediction of relapse in AML patients.","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, China;

Methods: The cytotoxicity of single substances in sensitive and resistant cells was investigated by MTT assay. We also applied combinations of extracts or single compounds with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin or doxorubicin plus the saponin digitonin. The intracellular retention of the ABC transporter substrates rhodamine 123 and calcein was examined by flow cytometry to explore the effect of the substances on the activity of ABC transporters P-glycoprotein and MRP1. Real-time PCR was applied to analyse the gene expression changes of ABCB1, ABCC1, caspase 3, caspase 8, AhR, CYP1A1, and GSTP1 in resistant cells under the treatment of the substances. Results: All the substances moderately inhibited cell growth in sensitive and resistant cells to some degree. Whereas ursolic acid showed IC50 of 14 and 22 microM in CEM/ADR 5000 and Caco-2 cells, respectively, glycyrrhizic acid and paeoniflorin were inactive with IC50 values above 400 muM. Except for liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin, all the other substances reversed MDR in CEM/ADR 5000 and Caco-2 cells to doxorubicin. Ue, ga, 18ga, and urs were powerful reversal agents. In CEM/ADR 5000 cells, high concentrations of all the substances, except Paeonia lactiflora extract, increased calcein or rhodamine 123 retention in a dose-dependent manner. In Caco-2 cells, all the substances, except liquiritigenin, retained rhodamine 123 in a dose-dependent manner. We also examined the effect of the plant secondary metabolite (PSM) panel on the expression of ABCB1, ABCC1, caspase 3, caspase 8, AhR, CYP1A1, and GSTP1 genes in MDR cells. Conclusions: The extracts and individual PSM could reverse MDR in CEM/ADR 5000 and Caco-2 cells, which overexpress ABC transporters, in two- and three-drug combinations. Most of the PSM also inhibited the activity of ABC transporters to some degree, albeit at high concentrations. Ue, ga, 18ga, and urs were identified as potential multidrug resistance (MDR) modulator candidates, which need to be characterized and validated in further studies.","['Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. junxian.zhou@stud.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. wink@uni-heidelberg.de.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7875-4510'],20181113,,,,,PMC6313689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The non-receptor tyrosine kinases are proteins involved in regulation of cell growth, adhesion, migration and apoptosis. They associate with metastatic dissemination in solid tumors and poor prognosis. However, their role in haematological malignancies has been scarcely studied. We hypothesized that PTK2/FAK, PTK2B/PYK2, LYN or SRC could be new prognostic markers in IR-AML. We assessed PTK2, PTK2B, LYN and SRC gene expression in a cohort of 324 patients, adults up to the age of 70, classified in the IR-AML cytogenetic group. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that PTK2B, LYN and PTK2 gene expression are independent prognostic factors in IR-AML patients. PTK2B and LYN identify a patient subgroup with good prognosis within the cohort with non-favorable FLT3/NPM1 combined mutations. In contrast, PTK2 identifies a patient subgroup with poor prognosis within the worst prognosis cohort who display non-favorable FLT3/NPM1 combined mutations and underexpression of PTK2B or LYN. The combined use of these markers can refine the highly heterogeneous intermediate-risk subgroup of AML patients, and allow the development of risk-adapted post-remission chemotherapy protocols to improve their response to treatment.","['Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Sant Antoni Maria Claret 167, Pavello 11, 2n pis, 08025 Barcelona, Spain. mpallaresl@santpau.cat.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Mas Casanovas n masculine 90, 08041 Barcelona, Spain. mpallaresl@santpau.cat.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Sant Antoni Maria Claret 167, Pavello 11, 2n pis, 08025 Barcelona, Spain. mhoyos@santpau.cat.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Mas Casanovas n masculine 90, 08041 Barcelona, Spain. mhoyos@santpau.cat.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL-Hospital Universitario, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC)-IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Universidad de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. chillon@usal.es.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Department of Medicine, University of Valencia, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, 46026 Valencia, Spain. barragan_eva@gva.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL-Hospital Universitario, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC)-IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Universidad de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. i.prietoconde@usal.es.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Department of Medicine, University of Valencia, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, 46026 Valencia, Spain. llop_mar@gva.es.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Sant Antoni Maria Claret 167, Pavello 11, 2n pis, 08025 Barcelona, Spain.

Targeting early events in the leukemogenic process has long been recognized as likely to offer the information required for these diseases. Analysis of the representation of different mutations in the leukemic cells from individual patients offers a retrospective method to infer their sequence of acquisition and associated subclonal dynamics. An alternative, prospective approach is to exploit strategies for recreating human leukemia de novo using defined genetic methods. This concept is not new, but has been historically difficult to realize. A brief review of our experience in generating insights into the properties and regulation of primitive normal human hematopoietic cells serves as a reminder of how this has enabled our recent advances in developing this approach using both primary sources of chronic myeloid leukemic cells and normal cord blood cells as targets.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, 675 West 10(th) Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.

To reconcile chromatin alterations with transcriptome changes, we performed paired exogenous spike-in normalized RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in DS models. Absolute normalization unmasks global amplification of gene expression associated with trisomy 21. Overexpression of the nucleosome binding protein HMGN1 (encoded on chr21q22) recapitulates transcriptional changes seen with triplication of a Down syndrome critical region on distal chromosome 21, and HMGN1 is necessary for B cell phenotypes in DS models. Absolute exogenous-normalized chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Rx) also reveals a global increase in histone H3K27 acetylation caused by HMGN1. Transcriptional amplification downstream of HMGN1 is enriched for stage-specific programs of B cells and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, dependent on the developmental cellular context. These data offer a mechanistic explanation for DS transcriptional patterns and suggest that further study of HMGN1 and RNA amplification in diverse DS phenotypes is warranted.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Therapeutic Innovation Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Interdepartmental Program in Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA; Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Therapeutic Innovation Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Therapeutic Innovation Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.

Epub 2018 Dec 6.,"Introduction: Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) in the relapsed setting remains challenging, despite recent impressive advances in the management of these patients. Venetoclax (ABT-199) is a BCL-2 inhibitor recently approved by the US food and drug administration for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia but the drug has shown activity in a number of hematological malignancies. Venetoclax has broadened the treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory MM. Approximately, 20% of myeloma patients will exhibit t (11;14) associated with high BCL-2 expression making venetoclax an attractive therapeutic option. The efficacy of venetoclax is not uniquely restricted to this population.

Conversion of a FLT-3 inhibitor (quizartinib) into a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) results in a compound that induces degradation of FLT-3 ITD mutant at low nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, the PROTAC is capable of inhibiting cell growth more potently than the warhead alone while inhibiting fewer off-target kinases. This enhanced antiproliferative activity occurs, despite a slight reduction in the PROTAC's kinase inhibitory activity, via an increased level of apoptosis induction suggesting nonkinase roles for the FLT-3 ITD protein. Additionally, the PROTAC is capable of inducing FLT-3 ITD degradation in vivo. These results suggest that degradation of FLT-3 ITD may provide a useful method for therapeutic intervention.","['Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Arvinas Inc. , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Departments of Chemistry and Pharmacology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06520 , United States.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2812-983X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8456-2005']",20181119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jan 22.,"OBJECTIVE: Short telomere length is a known risk factor for developing clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorders, probably due to chromosomal instability. We tested the hypotheses that bone marrow mononuclear cell telomere length change from diagnosis through chemotherapy-induced remission and relapse, and that long telomere length is associated with low risk of relapse and all-cause mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. METHODS: We measured telomere length in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 233 patients at diagnosis, 112 patients at chemotherapy-induced remission and 58 patients at relapse of disease. RESULTS: In patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, bone marrow mononuclear cell telomere length was similar at diagnosis and relapse, but increased after chemotherapy-induced remission. Furthermore, bone marrow mononuclear cell telomere length was longer in patients with higher age at diagnosis. There was no association between telomere length at diagnosis, remission or relapse and all-cause mortality, nor did we find any association between telomere length at diagnosis or remission and risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: In patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, bone marrow mononuclear cell telomere length increased from diagnosis to remission. Furthermore, telomere length paradoxically was longer at higher age at diagnosis, even after adjusting for known risk factors of disease severity. Finally, we did not detect any prognostic information in telomere length.","['Department of Haematology, Herlev and Gentofte hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Herlev and Gentofte hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4061-4133'],20190122,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Here, to study the role of LRF in the fetal stage beta-globin locus, we knocked out its expression in erythroid K562 cells, in which the gamma-globin genes are mainly transcribed. The gamma-globin transcription was reduced in LRF knock-out cells, and transcription factor binding to the beta-globin locus control region hypersensitive sites (LCR HSs) and active histone organization in the LCR HSs were disrupted by the depletion of LRF. In contrast, LRF loss in the adult stage beta-globin locus did not affect active chromatin structure in the LCR HSs and induced the fetal gamma-globin transcription. These results indicate that LRF may act as an activator and repressor of the human beta-like globin gene transcription in a manner dependent on developmental stage.","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea.']",,20181114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was successfully treated with insulin. Asparaginase is a vital part of treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. Asparaginase therapy has been reported to cause hyperglycemia especially when used in conjunction with glucocorticoids for the treatment of ALL in the pediatric population. Multiple mechanisms for hyperglycemia have been hypothesized which include decreased insulin secretion, impaired insulin receptor function and excess glucagon formation. Hyperglycemia is usually self-limiting but can deteriorate to diabetic ketoacidosis. DKA is a rare adverse effect with asparaginase therapy with an incidence rate of about 0.8%. Learning points: ** DKA is a rare finding following asparaginase therapy. ** Hyperglycemia is most commonly seen with asparaginase treatment when used along with glucocorticoid. ** Frequent blood glucose monitoring and prompt initiation of insulin treatment with hyperglycemia can prevent severe complications. ** Patients and physician education on this complication can reduce morbidity due to DKA.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.']",,20181031,,,,,PMC6215938,,"['(c) 2018 The authors.

Administration of asparaginase leads to asparagine starvation causing inhibition of protein synthesis, growth, and proliferation of tumor cells. Besides its clinical significance, the enzyme also finds application in the food sector for mitigation of a cancer-causing agent acrylamide. The numerous applications ensue huge market demands and create a continued interest in the production of costeffective, more specific, less immunogenic and stable formulations which can cater both the clinical and food processing requirements. The current review article approaches the process parameters of submerged and solid-state fermentation strategies for the microbial production of the L-asparaginase from diverse sources, genetic engineering approaches used for the production of L-asparaginase enzyme and major applications in clinical and food sectors. The review also addresses the immunological issues associated with the L-asparaginase usage and the immobilization strategies, drug delivery systems employed to circumvent the toxicity complications are also discussed. The future prospects for microbial Lasparaginase production are discussed at the end of the review article.","['School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi-221005, India.', 'School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi-221005, India.', 'School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi-221005, India.', 'School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi-221005, India.']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"BACKGROUND: Background: Mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a powerful tool for analyzing cellular networks at the single cell level. Due to the high-dimensional nature of this approach, analysis algorithms have been developed to visualize and interpret mass cytometry data. In this study, we applied these approaches to a cohort of patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). METHODS: We utilized mass cytometry to interrogate localization and intensity of thrombopoietin-mediated intracellular signaling in sAML. Extracellular and intracellular phenotypes were dissected using SPADE, viSNE, and PhenoGraph. RESULTS: Healthy controls exhibited highly localized signaling responses largely restricted to the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment. In contrast, sAML samples contained subpopulations outside the HSPC compartment exhibiting thrombopoietin (TPO) sensitivity comparable to or greater than immunophenotypically defined HSPCs. We employed unsupervised clustering by PhenoGraph to elucidate distinct subpopulations within these heterogeneous samples. One metacluster composed almost exclusively of Lin(-) CD61(+) CD34(-) CD38(-) CD45(low) cells was identified. This subpopulation was not readily identified by established manual gating approaches, and generally exhibited greater STAT phosphorylation in response to TPO stimulation than did Lin(-) CD61(-) CD34(+) CD38(-) cells. Lin(-) CD61(+) CD34(-) CD38(-) CD45(low) cells were identified in three additional sAML patients analyzed independently using a manual gating approach based upon PhenoGraph results. Each patient exhibited a similar TPO hypersensitivity to the PhenoGraph metacluster. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of this cellular subpopulation highlights the limitations of manual gating in sAML. Our study demonstrates the potential for mass cytometry to elucidate rare subpopulations in highly heterogeneous tumors by utilizing unsupervised high dimensional analysis.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by excessive accumulation of lymphoblast and progenitors. Leukemia is the most common cancer in children and ALL is the most common subtype. Many studies have shown that the YKL-40 gene is one of the most widely expressed genes in tumors, including leukemia, but not in healthy blood cells. Clinical studies have shown that serum YKL-40 levels have a positive correlation with tumor expansion, in addition to being a prognostic agent independent of a short relapse-free interval, as well as a brief overall survival in patients with various cancers. The previous study shows that YKL-40 is closely related to the degree of pathology or degree of human leukemia pathology and plays an important role in cell proliferation. Hence, the YKL-40 can be an attractive target in designing anticancer therapies. METHODS: CCRF-CEM cells were treated with resveratrol and prednisolone. For analysis of YKL-40 expression changes under medication, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot techniques were used at resonating intervals of 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: The effect of 15, 50, and 100 muM resveratrol and 700 muM of prednisolone on CCRF-CEM cells reduced YKL-40. The YKL-40 gene was quantitatively measured using RT-PCR. The Western blot method was used to evaluate changes in the expression of YKL-40 protein. CONCLUSION: In this study, we first evaluated YKL-40 expression and resveratrol and prednisolone effect on YKL-40 in ALL. This finding supports the idea of targeting YKL-40 as a new drug treatment of ALL and extends the use of resveratrol in antileukemia research.","['Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, School Paramedics, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7347-4272', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0962-818X']",20181113,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MiR34a was reported to be closely related to cancer cell proliferation. Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) was a transcription factor that played a different role in different cancer types. CDK6 was involved in cell cycle progression and was upregulated in several types of cancers. The present study investigated the effects of MKL1/miR34a/FOXP3 axis on cell proliferation in MGC803 gastric cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of MKL1 promoted proliferation of MGC80-3 cells, MKL1 directly binding to the promoter of CDK6 to increase its expression. Knockdown of FOXP3 promoted proliferation of MGC80-3 cells and MKL1 inhibited the expression of FOXP3 via miR-34a.

We aimed to assed the epidemiology, correlated risk factors and outcomes of AKI in cancer patients from China. We conducted a nationwide cohort study of cancer patients who were admitted to 25 general and children hospitals across China from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. We obtained patient-level data from the electronic hospitalization information system and laboratory databases of all inpatients who had at least two serum creatinine tests within any 7-day window during their first 30 days of hospitalization. AKI was defined and staged according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Incidence rate and risk factor profiles for AKI were examined. Outcomes of interest included in-hospital mortality, length of stay and daily costs. A total of 136,756 adult cancer patients were assessed in our study. The overall incidence of AKI was 7.5%, of which 1.6% were community acquired and 5.9% hospital acquired. The top three cancer types with high incidence of AKI were bladder cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. Risk factors for community-acquired and hospital-acquired AKI were similar, including age, increased baseline serum creatinine, shock and urinary tract obstruction. In-hospital death occurred in 12.0% with AKI vs. 0.9% cancer patients without AKI. After adjustment for confounders, the severe AKI was associated with higher risk of in-hospital death, prolonged length of stay and higher daily costs. Clinicians should increase their awareness of AKI in hospitalized cancer patients.","['Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5511-0288'],20190103,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 UICC.'],,,,,['EACH study investigators'],,,,,,,

However, little is known about HEV infection in patients receiving haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT). Here, we retrospectively evaluate the incidence and clinical course of HEV infection in haplo-HSCT patients. From January 2014 to July 2017, 177 patients with unexplained elevated transaminases after receiving haplo-HSCT at Peking University Institute of Haematology were screened for HEV using HEV serology. HEV RNA was assessed in blood samples when HEV-IgG and/or IgM antibodies were positive. Acute HEV infection was identified in 7 patients (3.9%), 1 of whom had developed a chronic HEV infection. The median time from haplo-HSCT to HEV infection was 17.5 (range, 6-55) months. HEV infection was confirmed by the presentation of anti-HEV IgM + anti-HEV IgG (rising) (n = 5) or HEV-RNA + anti-HEV IgM + anti-HEV IgG (n = 2). None of the patients died of HEV infection directly: 2 patients with HEV infection died showing signs of ongoing hepatitis, and 5 patients cleared HEV with a median duration of HEV infection of 1.5 (range, 1.0-5.7) months. In conclusion, HEV infection is a rare but serious complication after haplo-HSCT.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company submission (CS), the ERG's critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness evidence in the CS, key methodological considerations and the development of the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee (AC). The CS presented three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two of these were trials in newly diagnosed APL (APL0406 and AML17) and the third trial was in patients with relapsed APL. Results from APL0406 showed that more people having AATO [ATO plus all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)] were alive at 50 months compared with people having AIDA (ATRA in combination with idarubicin) (99% vs. 93%; p = 0.007). There was also a statistically significant lower cumulative incidence of relapse with AATO compared with AIDA at 50 months (2% vs. 14%; p = 0.001). At 4 years, results from AML17 showed a significant difference in event-free survival (91% vs. 70%; p = 0.002) favouring AATO but not in overall survival (93% vs. 89%; p = 0.250). The only trial presented for relapsed/refractory patients compared AATO with ATO, which was not a relevant comparison according to the NICE scope. The AC concluded that AATO was effective for untreated APL while for relapsed or refractory APL the effectiveness of ATO was considered uncertain and the long-term safety remains unexplored. In the CS base-case, AATO was less expensive ( pound31,088 saved) and more effective (2.546 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained) than AIDA and thus the dominating strategy for newly diagnosed low- to intermediate-risk APL. However, the ERG's critical assessment highlighted a number of concerns, including deviations from the NICE reference case and a lack of detailed description and justification of parameters and assumptions related to (the extrapolation of) treatment effectiveness. However, it was reassuring that AATO for untreated APL remained dominant in the ERG base-case, and that the worst-case scenario produced by the ERG resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound21,622. The AC concluded that although there was uncertainty in the model, it could recommend ATO for both untreated and relapsed or refractory APL.","['Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment (KEMTA), Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands. bram.ramaekers@mumc.nl.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment (KEMTA), Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment (KEMTA), Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment (KEMTA), Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Care and Public Health Research Institute (CAPHRI), Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment (KEMTA), Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Care and Public Health Research Institute (CAPHRI), Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5785-9228'],,,,['DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,PMC6559128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes sensory dysfunctions such as paresthesia, dysesthesia, and chronic neuropathic pain. MiR-20a facilitates the axonal outgrowth of the cortical neurons. However, the role of miR-20a in the axonal outgrowth of primary sensory neurons and spinal cord dorsal column lesion (SDCL) is yet unknown. Therefore, the role of miR-20a post-SDCL was investigated in rat. The NF-200 immunofluorescence staining was applied to observe whether axonal outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons could be altered by miR-20a or PDZ-RhoGEF modulation in vitro. The expression of miR-20a was quantized with RT-PCR. Western blotting analyzed the expression of PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA/GAP43 axis after miR-20a or PDZ-RhoGEF was modulated. The spinal cord sensory conduction function was assessed by somatosensory-evoked potentials and tape removal test. The results demonstrated that the expression of miR-20a decreased in a time-dependent manner post-SDCL. The regulation of miR-20a modulated the axonal growth and the expression of PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA/GAP43 axis in vitro. The in vivo regulation of miR-20a altered the expression of miR-20a-PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA/GAP43 axis and promoted the recovery of ascending sensory function post-SDCL. The results indicated that miR-20a/PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA/GAP43 axis is associated with the pathophysiological process of SDCL. Thus, targeting the miR-20a/PDZ-RhoGEF /RhoA/GAP43 axis served as a novel strategy in promoting the sensory function recovery post-SCI.","[""Department of Orthopedics, The 266th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Spine Surgery, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100020, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Spine Surgery, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100020, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Spine Surgery, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100020, People's Republic of China."", ""Leukemia Center, Peking Union of Medical College, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, 30020, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 266th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 266th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 266th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 266th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurology, The 266th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China. 870808116@qq.com."", ""Department of General Surgery, The 266th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China. wtyjjandt@sina.cn."", ""Department of Spine Surgery, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100020, People's Republic of China. sjxfcd@sina.com.""]","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7923-3717', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0022-0583', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8474-9323']",20181113,,,"['H2017101030/The General Program of Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province', 'of China', '16QNP074/The Medical Science and Technology Youth Cultivation Project of the', ""Chinese People's Liberation Army"", '13QNP017/The Medical Science and Technology Youth Cultivation Project of the', ""Chinese People's Liberation Army"", '201606A062/The Research and Development of Science and Technology Program', 'Supported by Chengde Government', 'KM201710025028/the Beijing Municipal Education Commission General Project', 'Z161100000116064/The Capital characteristic project', 'lh201425Shi/The Public Experiment Training Foundation of Beijing Luhe Hospital,', 'Capital Medical University, China']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent advances in the classification of prognosis in CLL patients, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to genomic instability and progression of this disease remains inadequate. Interestingly, dysregulated expression of KDM4 members is involved in the progression of several cancer types and plays a role in the DNA damage response; however, the gene expression profile and the importance of KDM4 members in CLL are still unknown. Here, we assessed the gene expression profile of KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C in 59 CLL samples and investigated whether these histone demethylases have any influence on the prognostic markers of this leukemia. KDM4A gene expression was higher in CLL patients as compared with control samples. In contrast, CLL samples showed decreased levels of the KDM4B transcript in relation to control cases, and no difference was detected in KDM4C expression. Furthermore, patients with positive expression of ZAP-70 had lower expression of KDM4B and KDM4C as compared with ZAP-70-negative patients. More importantly, patients with low expression of these histone demethylases had higher leukemic cell numbers and displayed adverse cytogenetic findings and the acquisition of a complex karyotype. The present data clearly show that the expression of KDM4 members is dysregulated in CLL and impact the prognosis of this leukemia. These findings are useful for a better understanding of the impact of epigenetics on CLL progression.","['Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular, Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular, Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Hematologia, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular, Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biotecnologia, Universidade Catolica de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Hematologia, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular, Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil. felipearaujo@unb.br.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4200-0821'],20181113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 22q11.2 duplication syndrome is an extremely variable disorder with a phenotype ranging from severe intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, heart defects, and urogenital abnormalities to very mild symptoms. Both benign and malignant hematological entities are rare. A male patient was diagnosed with mild facial dysmorphia, congenital heart anomalies shortly after birth and acute bowel obstruction due to malrotation of the intestine at the age of 3 years. A whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array revealed a de novo 6.6 Mb duplication in the 22q11.1q11.22 chromosomal region. A year later, the patient was diagnosed with acute pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL). Five genes, CDC45, CLTCL1, DGCR2, GP1BB and SEPT5, in the 22q11.1q11.22 region are potentially responsible for cell cycle division. We hypothesized that dosage imbalance of genes implicated in the rearrangement could have disrupted the balance between cell growth and differentiation and played a role in the initiation of malignancy with a hyperdiploid leukemic clone, whereas over-expression of the TBX1 gene might have been responsible for congenital heart defects and mild facial dysmorphia.","[""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu St. 4, LT 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania."", ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu St. 4, LT 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania."", ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu St. 4, LT 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania."", ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu St. 4, LT 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania."", ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu St. 4, LT 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania."", ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu St. 4, LT 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania."", ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu St. 4, LT 08406 Vilnius, Lithuania.""]",,20181029,,,,,PMC6231321,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with AML are routinely profiled for the presence of mutations in FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and, more recently, TP53 In this chapter, we review the role of mutational profiling to help define disease biology in AML, particularly among patients with putatively intermediate-risk disease. We describe the body of evidence supporting the utility of mutational profiling when performed at the time of diagnosis (to identify prognostic and targetable mutations), at the time of complete remission (to assess minimal residual disease as a marker for relapse), and at the time of relapse (to identify therapeutic targets and eligibility for clinical trials). We further identify particular mutations that have been shown to affect prognosis across the established European LeukemiaNet risk categories and discuss which mutational events might be used to alter the approach to patient care at various time points during the disease course. We also review the evidence in support of molecular profiling for assessment of minimal/measurable residual disease and describe the current landscape of studies designed to validate this approach.","['State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.']",,,,,,,PMC6234366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of VTE and its effect on survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients remains unclear. The present study investigated the impact of patient-related factors, CLL prognostic markers, and CLL treatment on the risk of VTE and assessed overall survival relative to VTE. All patients in the Danish National CLL Registry (2008-2015) were followed from the date of CLL diagnosis to death, VTE, emigration, or administrative censoring. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox models, and second primary cancers and anticoagulation treatment were included as time-varying exposures. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, 92 VTEs occurred among 3609 CLL patients, corresponding to a total incidence rate of 8.2 VTEs per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-10.1). A history of VTE or second primary cancer was associated with HRs of VTE of 5.09 (95% CI, 2.82-9.17) and 3.72 (95% CI, 2.15-6.34), respectively, while beta2-microglobulin >4 mg/L, unmutated immunoglobulin HV and unfavorable cytogenetics had lower HRs. CLL patients with VTE had marginally higher mortality, which was most pronounced among patients <60 years of age (HR, 7.74; 95% CI, 2.12-28.29). Our findings suggest that markers of unfavorable CLL prognosis contribute to an increased risk of VTE; however, previous VTE or a second primary cancer is more strongly associated with the risk of VTE than any CLL-specific marker. Focusing attention on this preventable complication may improve survival in young CLL patients.","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care and.', 'Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital of Southern Denmark, Aabenraa, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Roskilde Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Vejle Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Holstebro Hospital, Holstebro, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Esbjerg Hospital, Esbjerg, Denmark; and.', 'Unit of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and.', 'Unit of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.']",,,,,,,PMC6234357,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have uncovered roles for epigenetic modification in the regulation of mechanisms contributing to malignant progression of CLL B cells. However, the extent to which epigenetic modifiers can be targeted for therapeutic benefit in CLL patients remains poorly explored. We report for the first time that expression of epigenetic modifier histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is upregulated in CLL patient samples, cell lines, and euTCL1 transgenic mouse models compared with HDAC6 in normal controls. Genetic silencing of HDAC6 conferred survival benefit in euTCL1 mice. Administration of isoform-specific HDAC6 inhibitor ACY738 in the euTCL1 aging and adoptive transfer models deterred proliferation of CLL B cells, delayed disease onset via disruption of B-cell receptor signaling, and sensitized CLL B cells to apoptosis. Furthermore, coadministration of ACY738 and ibrutinib displayed synergistic cell kill against CLL cell lines and improved overall survival compared with either single agent in vivo. These results demonstrate for the first time the therapeutic efficacy of selective HDAC6 inhibition in preclinical CLL models and suggest a rationale for the clinical development of HDAC6 inhibitors for CLL treatment, either alone or in combination with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibition.","['Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Cancer Biology PhD Program, University of South Florida and Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA.', 'Cue Biopharma, Cambridge, MA.', 'Cue Biopharma, Cambridge, MA.', 'Regency Pharmaceuticals LLC, Waltham, MA.', 'George Washington Cancer Center, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, Washington, DC; and.', 'George Washington Cancer Center, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, Washington, DC; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2721-1188'],,,,"['P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA179062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA147832/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6234358,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"To identify new therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed small-molecule and small-interfering RNA (siRNA) screens of primary AML patient samples. In 23% of samples, we found sensitivity to inhibition of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptor (CSF1R), a receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for survival, proliferation, and differentiation of myeloid-lineage cells. Sensitivity to CSF1R inhibitor GW-2580 was found preferentially in de novo and favorable-risk patients, and resistance to GW-2580 was associated with reduced overall survival. Using flow cytometry, we discovered that CSF1R is not expressed on the majority of leukemic blasts but instead on a subpopulation of supportive cells. Comparison of CSF1R-expressing cells in AML vs healthy donors by mass cytometry revealed expression of unique cell-surface markers. The quantity of CSF1R-expressing cells correlated with GW-2580 sensitivity. Exposure of primary AML patient samples to a panel of recombinant cytokines revealed that CSF1R inhibitor sensitivity correlated with a growth response to CSF1R ligand, CSF1, and other cytokines, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The addition of CSF1 increased the secretion of HGF and other cytokines in conditioned media from AML patient samples, whereas adding GW-2580 reduced their secretion. In untreated cells, HGF levels correlated significantly with GW-2580 sensitivity. Finally, recombinant HGF and HS-5-conditioned media rescued cell viability after GW-2580 treatment in AML patient samples. Our results suggest that CSF1R-expressing cells support the bulk leukemia population through the secretion of HGF and other cytokines. This study identifies CSF1R as a novel therapeutic target of AML and provides a mechanism of paracrine cytokine/growth factor signaling in this disease.","['Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; and.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; and.', 'School of Public Health, Oregon Health & Science University-Portland State University, Portland, OR.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, and.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Knight Cancer Institute.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2708-9562', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4231-8562', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6207-7068', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1390-4917', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6400-3161', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9010-8167', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8333-6607', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2133-0960']",20181113,['Blood. 2019 Feb 7;133(6):506-507.

In this study, we aimed to explore the biological role of hsa_circ_100290 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). First, we found that the expression of hsa_circ_100290 was increased in human AML samples and cell lines. Down-regulation of hsa_circ_100290 significantly suppressed cell proliferation of AML cells. Silencing hsa_circ_100290 also dramatically induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay revealed that hsa_circ_100290 and Rab10 were targeted by miR-203. Validation experiments verified that hsa_circ_100290 was co-expressed with Rab10 and was negatively correlated with miR-203 expression. Moreover, rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-203 inhibitor could reverse the role of hsa_circ_100290 knockdown on proliferation and apoptosis in AML cells.

We analyzed the characteristics of 88 patients with CMML homogeneously treated with 5-azacytidine (Hellenic 5-Azacytidine Registry). The overall response rate was 48.9% and the median overall survival (OS) 29.7 months. Out of the seven most widely used prognostic scoring systems for CMML, the Dusseldorf score (DUSS) showed the best prognostic capability (HR, 2.27; p < .001). Forty-one (48.8%) patients progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after a median time of 15.2 months following treatment initiation. High serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were independently correlated with low OS (HR, 2.84; p = .022), as were circulating blasts (HR, 3.47; p = .014), while a platelet count <100 x 10(9)/L was marginally predictive of lower OS (HR, 1.45; p = .06). We selected these three factors to create a new risk stratification system for CMML with three risk groups. Finally, we highlighted for the first time the prognostic significance of serum ferritin levels in CMML.","['a First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit , Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'b Department of Hematology , University Hospital of Alexandroupolis , Alexandroupoli , Greece.', 'c Department of Internal Medicine , University Hospital of Patras , Rio , Greece.', 'd Haematology Division, Second Department of Internal Medicine , Attikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', ""e Department of Clinical Hematology , ' G.

Although our understanding of cancer at the molecular level continues to improve, more effort is needed to develop new therapeutic tools and approaches exploiting these advances. Because of its high efficiency and accuracy, the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool in the arsenal of cancer therapy. Among its many applications, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown an unprecedented clinical potential to discover novel targets for cancer therapy and to dissect chemical-genetic interactions, providing insight into how tumours respond to drug treatment. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 can be employed to rapidly engineer immune cells and oncolytic viruses for cancer immunotherapeutic applications. Perhaps more importantly, the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 to accurately edit genes, not only in cell culture models and model organisms but also in humans, allows its use in therapeutic explorations. In this review, we discuss important considerations for the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in therapeutic settings and major challenges that will need to be addressed prior to its clinical translation for a complex and polygenic disease such as cancer.","['Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain. mmlage@cnio.es.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain. ppuig@cnio.es.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain. pmenendez@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain. pmenendez@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBER-ONC), ISCIII, 08010 Barcelona, Spain. pmenendez@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain. rtorresr@ext.cnio.es.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain. rtorresr@ext.cnio.es.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain. srodriguezp@cnio.es.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9606-0398'],20181112,,,"['PI17/02303/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'Postdoctoral fellowship/Fundacion Cientifica Asociacion Espanola Contra el Cancer']",,PMC6315587,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic Lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and resistance to apoptosis due to gene mutation or abnormal gene expression. In our previous study, constitutively photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) was shown to be upregulated in Binet C-phase CLL patients. Based on the negative regulation of COP1 in the repair of DNA damage, we further studied the function of COP1 in CLL cell apoptosis induced by fludarabine in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We analyzed the sensitivity of primary CLL cells to the fludarabine by CCK-8, and detected the expression of p53 in cells after drug treatment by western blot. Next, we constructed COP1 overexrpessing CLL cell line HG3, and analyzed the effect of COP1 overexpression on the HG3 cell's apoptosis, and HG3 transplant mice survival with drug treatment. RESULTS: Here, we found that primary CLL cells with high expression of COP1 showed low sensitivity to the drug and presented delayed enrichment of p53 protein than cells with low COP1 expressed. COP1 overexpression reduced HG3 cell sensitivity to the fludarabine treatment and inhibited cell apoptosis, and also retarded itself via autoubiquitination. The further study showed that COP1 promoted ubiquitin-dependent p53 degradation, which further disrupts the formation of the p53-Brn-3a complex and activation of Bcl-2 transcription. Moreover, mice engrafted with cells overexpressing COP1 showed a shortened survival, increased tumor cells burden in spleen and bone marrow (BM), and reduced tumor cell apoptosis even when fludarabine combined cyclophosphamide (F+C) therapy was administered. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that COP1 contributes to drug resistance of CLL cells to the fludarabine treatment in vitro and in vivo.","['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, ChinaLihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, ChinaLihmd@163.com.']",,20181113,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Nov 10.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe incidence patterns of lymphoid neoplasms in the Girona province (Spain) (1996-2015), and to predict the number of cases in Spain during 2020. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Girona cancer registry. Incident cases were classified using the ICD-O-3, third revision, and grouped according to the WHO 2008 classification scheme. Age-adjusted incidence rates to the European standard population (ASRE) were estimated and incidence trends were modeled using Joinpoint. RESULTS: 4367 lymphoid neoplasms were diagnosed in the Girona province. The ASRE for overall lymphoma was 37.1 (95% CI: 36.0; 38.2), with a marked male predominance in almost all subtypes. During 1996-2015, incidence trends remained stable for broader lymphoma categories. According to our predictions, 17,950 new cases of LNs will be diagnosed in Spain in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This 'real-world' data will provide valuable information to better inform etiological hypotheses and plan future health-care services.","['Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red: Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Av.

In previous study, we identified a homolog of HMGB1 in the Lampetra japonica(L-HMGB1), and further revealed that L-HMGB1 was able to induce the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in activated human acute monocytic leukemia cells. However, the role of L-HMGB1 played in lamprey was unknown. Here, we found that L-HMGB1 was located in the cytoplasm of lamprey leukocytes and supraneural body (SB) cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that L-HMGB1 participated in activation of various key molecules in inflammation signaling pathway. LPS also promoted the release of L-HMGB1 from SB cells similar to Hu-HMGB1, and then extracellular L-HMGB1 in turn induced the release of cytokines. This study revealed that the synergistic action of LPS and L-HMGB1 played a crucial role in inflammation in lamprey. Our results suggested that lampreys used L-HMGB1 to activate their innate immunity for the purpose of pathogen defense.","['College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Lamprey Research Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China.', 'College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Lamprey Research Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China.', 'College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Lamprey Research Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China.', 'College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Lamprey Research Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China.', 'College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Lamprey Research Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China.', 'College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Lamprey Research Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China.

Epub 2018 Nov 10.,"Survivors of invasive melanoma have an increased risk of developing second primary cancers; however, similar risks associated with in situ melanoma have not been established. We evaluated 39,872 survivors of first primary in situ melanoma diagnosed from 1982 through 2012 in Queensland, Australia. Relative risk of second nonmelanoma primary cancers was estimated from standardized incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 4,823 (12%) in situ melanoma survivors developed a second primary cancer. A small increased risk (6%) compared with the general population was found. In those younger than 50 years, risk was increased by 14% for all cancers combined. In situ melanoma survivors had significantly increased risks of developing lip, thyroid, pancreatic, and brain cancers and decreased risks of head and neck, and lung cancers. Male in situ melanoma survivors had a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer; female survivors had an increased risk of thyroid cancer and lymphoid leukemia. Findings indicate that in situ melanoma may predict the diagnosis of certain second primary cancers. This altered risk may be due to biological, behavioral, or genetic factors or increased medical surveillance, and it requires further investigation, particularly among people younger than 50 years.","['University of the Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs, Queensland, Australia; Cancer Council Queensland, Spring Hill, Queensland, Australia.

JARID2 is lost by chromosomal deletions in a proportion of MPN/MDS cases that progress to sAML. In this study, genetic mouse models and patient-derived xenografts demonstrated that JARID2 acts as a tumor suppressor in chronic myeloid disorders. Genetic deletion of Jarid2 either reduced overall survival of animals with MPNs or drove transformation to sAML, depending on the timing and context of co-operating mutations. Mechanistically, JARID2 recruits PRC2 to epigenetically repress self-renewal pathways in hematopoietic progenitor cells. These studies establish JARID2 as a bona fide hematopoietic tumor suppressor and highlight potential therapeutic targets.","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Genome Technology Access Center, Department of Genetics, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA; Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology Program, Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.

We demonstrate that amino acid uptake, steady-state levels, and catabolism are all elevated in the leukemia stem cell (LSC) population. Furthermore, LSCs isolated from de novo AML patients are uniquely reliant on amino acid metabolism for oxidative phosphorylation and survival. Pharmacological inhibition of amino acid metabolism reduces oxidative phosphorylation and induces cell death. In contrast, LSCs obtained from relapsed AML patients are not reliant on amino acid metabolism due to their ability to compensate through increased fatty acid metabolism. These findings indicate that clinically relevant eradication of LSCs can be achieved with drugs that target LSC metabolic vulnerabilities.","['Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, 12700 East 19(th) Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

CHAF1B has a pro-leukemia effect by binding chromatin at discrete sites and interfering with occupancy of transcription factors that promote myeloid differentiation, such as CEBPA. Reducing Chaf1b activity by either heterozygous deletion or overexpression of a CAF1 dominant negative allele is sufficient to suppress leukemogenesis in vivo without impairing normal hematopoiesis.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, 303 East Superior Street, 5-123, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, 303 East Superior Street, 5-123, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, 303 East Superior Street, 5-123, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Therapeutics Program of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Therapeutics Program of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.', 'Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, 303 East Superior Street, 5-123, Chicago, IL 60611, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.

The amount of spending likely to occur outside of oncologists' purview is unknown. METHODS: Following the OCM definition of an episode, we used SEER-Medicare data from 2006 to 2013 to identify episodes of cancer care for the following diagnoses: breast cancer (BC), non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma (MM), and chronic myeloid leukemia. Claims were categorized by service type and, separately, whether the content fell within the purview of oncology providers (classified as oncology, with all other claims nononcology). We calculated the shares of episode spending attributable to oncology versus nononcology services. RESULTS: The percentage of oncology spending within OCM episodes ranged from 62.4% in BC to 85.5% in MM. The largest source of oncology spending was antineoplastic drug therapy, ranging from 21.8% of total episode spending in BC to 67.6% in chronic myeloid leukemia. The largest source of nononcology spending was acute hospitalization and inpatient physician costs, ranging from 6.6% of overall spending for MM to 10.4% for non-small-cell lung cancer; inpatient oncology spending contributed roughly similar shares to overall spending. CONCLUSION: Most spending in OCM-defined episodes was attributable to services related to cancer care, especially antineoplastic drug therapy. Inability to control nononcology spending may present challenges for practices participating in the OCM, however.","['Precision Health Economics; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Emmaus, PA.', 'Precision Health Economics; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Emmaus, PA.', 'Precision Health Economics; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Emmaus, PA.', 'Precision Health Economics; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Emmaus, PA.', 'Precision Health Economics; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Emmaus, PA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today's clinical guidelines include multiple regimens, some of which continue to use cytotoxic chemotherapy. This leaves the practicing oncologist with multiple treatment options when faced with a new case of APL. In an effort to standardize our approach to the treatment of newly diagnosed APL, we sought to develop a set of treatment recommendations at our institution. We identified eight major controversial issues in the treatment of APL. These controversial issues include the optimal dose and schedule of both all- trans-retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, the optimal regimen for high-risk APL, the need for intrathecal prophylaxis, the use of prophylactic corticosteroids, and the need for maintenance therapy after consolidation. We reviewed the relevant literature and used the Delphi method among the coauthors to reach consensus for recommendations on the basis of the best available data and our own clinical experience.

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"BACKGROUND: In the current study, the authors determined whether adhering to molecular monitoring guidelines in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with major molecular response (MMR) and assessed barriers to adherent monitoring. METHODS: Newly treated patients with CML from the Quebec province-wide CML registry from 2005 to 2016 were included. Timely polymerase chain reaction (tPCR) was defined as the molecular assessment of BCR-ABL1 at the 3-month, 12-month, and 18-month time points from the initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. The cohort was analyzed as a nested case-control study. Cases with a first-ever MMR (BCR-ABL1 </=0.1%, assessed at any time during follow-up) were matched to up to 5 controls by duration of TKI therapy, volume of patients with CML at the treatment center, year of cohort entry, and age. Odds ratios (ORs) for the performance of tPCR and MMR were adjusted for sex, comorbidities, type of TKI, and other important covariates. RESULTS: The cohort included 496 patients. Of 392 MMR events, 67.9% occurred before 18 months. The performance of tPCR was associated with a doubling of the MMR rate (OR, 2.23; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.56-3.21) and was similar with 1 to 3 tPCRs performed (P = .67). Furthermore, tPCRs at 3 months (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.81-4.23) and 12 months (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.64-5.49) were associated with achieving early MMR, whereas tPCRs at 18 months were not (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.80-1.89). Low-volume centers were found to have lower adherence to tPCR (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Timely molecular assessment at 3 months and 12 months appears to benefit patients with CML. Adherence to timely monitoring should be encouraged, especially in low-volume treatment centers.","['Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Epidemiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Epidemiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Segal Cancer Center, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, University of Montreal Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'University of Quebec Center of Hematology and Oncology, University of Quebec Health Centre, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Epidemiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Segal Cancer Center, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5162-3556'],20181113,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,"['Groupe Quebecois de Recherche en Leucemie Myeloide Chronique et Neoplasies', 'Myeloproliferatives (GQR LMC-NMP)']",,,,,,,

There are few data on AKI incidence and risk factors in the current era of cancer treatment. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study of all patients initiating systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted agents) for a new cancer diagnosis in Ontario, Canada (2007-2014). The primary outcome was hospitalization with AKI or acute dialysis. We estimated the cumulative incidence of AKI and fitted Fine and Gray models, adjusting for demographics, cancer characteristics, comorbidities, and coprescriptions. We modeled exposure to systemic therapy (the 90-day period following treatments) as a time-varying covariate. We also assessed temporal trends in annual AKI incidence. RESULTS: We identified 163 071 patients initiating systemic therapy of whom 10 880 experienced AKI. The rate of AKI was 27 per 1000 person-years, with overall cumulative incidence of 9.3% (95% CI = 9.1% to 9.6%). Malignancies with the highest 5-year AKI incidence were myeloma (26.0%, 95% CI = 24.4% to 27.7%), bladder (19.0%, 95% CI = 17.6% to 20.5%), and leukemia (15.4%, 95% CI = 14.3% to 16.5%). Advanced cancer stage, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of AKI (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.54; 1.80, 95% CI = 1.67 to 1.93; and 1.43, 95% CI = 1.37 to 1.50, respectively). In patients aged 66 years or older with universal drug benefits, diuretic, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker coprescription was associated with higher AKI risk (aHR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.28; 1.30, 95% CI = 1.23 to 1.38). AKI risk was further accentuated during the 90-day period following systemic therapy (aHR = 2.34, 95% CI = 2.24 to 2.45). The annual incidence of AKI increased from 18 to 52 per 1000 person-years between 2007 and 2014. CONCLUSION: Cancer-related AKI is common and associated with advanced stage, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and concomitant receipt of diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. Risk is heightened in the 90 days after systemic therapy. Preventive strategies are needed to address the increasing burden of AKI in this population.","['Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Nephrology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, London, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Oncology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, London, ON, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Nephrology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, London, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, Western University, London, ON, Canada (AXG).', 'Division of Nephrology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, London, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",,,['CA Cancer J Clin. 2020 Jan;70(1):5-6.

Some small-molecule kinase inhibitors such as imatinib were developed in the treatment of CML; however, resistant to imatinib is an emerging problem of CML therapy. Hence, additional approaches or compounds targeting leukemogenic cells are required. F-B1 is a new compound obtained by modifying DAW-22, a natural sesquiterpenoid coumarin, which was isolated from traditional Chinese medicine Ferula ferulaeoides (Steud.) Korov. F-B1 was found to inhibit the growth of myelogenous leukemia cell lines, that is, K562 cells bearing wild-type Bcr/Abl and imatinib-resistant K562G cells. F-B1 potently down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of Bcr/Abl, followed by suppression of the downstream molecules such as Akt, externally regulated kinases, and nuclear factor kappaB. In addition, F-B1 also induced cell apoptosis by impairing the balance between proapoptotic protein Bax and antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and increased the activity of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in nude mouse xenografts. Experimental validation results together demonstrated that F-B1 can inhibit Bcr/Abl fusion proteins in K562 and K562G cells, implying that F-B1 might be a promising drug to treat CML, especially the imatinib-resistant CML.","['Key laboratory for Rare Disease of Shandong Province, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan.', 'School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurosciences, New Jersey Medical School Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey, USA.', 'Key laboratory for Rare Disease of Shandong Province, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 14-year-old African American female presented with fatigue, easy bruising, and fever. On examination, she had scattered bruising, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia with peripheral blasts, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; French-American-British M2, t[8;21][q22;q22.1]) was diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy. A baseline echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction [EF], 60%; shortening fraction [SF], 32%), and conventional chemotherapy was initiated that consisted of two cycles of remission induction (cytarabine, etoposide, and daunorubicin [50 mg/m(2) x 3 days per cycle]) followed by intensification 1 (high-dose cytarabine and etoposide), intensification 2 (high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone [12 mg/m(2)/dose daily; four total doses]), and intensification 3 (high-dose cytarabine and l-asparaginase). Of note, an echocardiogram was not repeated before the start of intensification 1. During intensification 1, the patient developed Streptococcus viridans sepsis, which required 4 days in the intensive care unit with antimicrobial and inotropic support. Repeat echocardiogram after recovery from the sepsis episode demonstrated low-normal LV systolic function (EF, 53%; SF, 27%), and she subsequently began intensification 2. On day 3 of intensification 2, the patient developed afebrile tachypnea, tachycardia, and an increasing oxygen requirement. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac troponins were normal, whereas N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide was 10 times the upper limit of normal. Repeat echocardiogram showed an enlarged LV with moderate to severely depressed LV function (EF, 28%; SF, 14%). Day 4 mitoxantrone was omitted and a cardiology consult obtained.","['1 City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', ""2 St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",,20181113,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2019 Jan 1;37(1):12-21.

Epub 2018 Dec 13.,"The majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have a poor response to conventional chemotherapy. The survival of chemoresistant cells is thought to depend on leukemia-bone marrow (BM) microenvironment interactions, which are not well understood. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis has been proposed to support AML growth but was not studied at the single AML cell level. We recently showed that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are highly motile in the BM; however, the characteristics of AML cell migration within the BM remain undefined. Here, we characterize the in vivo migratory behavior of AML cells and their response to chemotherapy and CXCR4 antagonism, using high-resolution 2-photon and confocal intravital microscopy of mouse calvarium BM and the well-established MLL-AF9-driven AML mouse model. We used the Notch1-driven T-ALL model as a benchmark comparison and AMD3100 for CXCR4 antagonism experiments. We show that AML cells are migratory, and in contrast with T-ALL, chemoresistant AML cells become less motile.

Epub 2018 Dec 7.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the longer survival achieved in multiple myeloma (MM) patients due to new therapy strategies, a concern is emerging regarding an increased risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) and how to characterize those patients at risk. We performed a retrospective study covering a 28-year follow-up period (1991-2018) in a tertiary single institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 403 MM patients were recorded and compared with the epidemiologic register of the population area covered by our centre, calculating the standardize incidence ratio (SIR) for the different types of SPMs diagnosed in the MM cohort. Fine and Gray regression models were used to identify risk factors for SPMs. RESULTS: Out of the 403 MM patients, 23 (5.7%) developed SPMs: 13 therapy-related myeloid (TRM) malignancies (10 of them (77%) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 1 acute lymphoid leukaemia and 9 solid neoplasms. In the MM cohort, the relative risk of MDS was significantly higher than in the general population. Survival of patients with TRM malignancies was poor with a median of 4 months from the diagnosis, and most of them showed complex karyotype. Within the MM subset, multivariable analysis showed a higher risk of TRM malignancies in patients that previously received prolonged treatment with lenalidomide (>18 months). CONCLUSIONS: Though the improvement in MM outcome during the last decades is an unprecedented achievement, it has been accompanied by the rise in TRM malignancies with complex cytogenetic profile and poor prognosis that are in the need of an improved biologic and therapeutic approach.","['Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Spain.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Sociosanitarias, IMIB-Arrixaca, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Spain.', 'Servicio de Epidemiologia, Consejeria de Sanidad, IMIB-Arrixaca, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5843-4771'],20181207,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal', 'Foundation.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells harboring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). This study prospectively evaluated the 2HG levels, IDH1/2 mutational status, and outcomes of patients receiving standard chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. METHODS: Serial samples of serum, urine, and bone marrow aspirates were collected from patients newly diagnosed with AML, and 2HG levels were measured with mass spectrometry. Patients with baseline serum 2HG levels greater than 1000 ng/mL or marrow pellet 2HG levels greater than 1000 ng/2 x 10(6) cells, which suggested the presence of an IDH1/2 mutation, underwent serial testing. IDH1/2 mutations and estimated variant allele frequencies were identified. AML characteristics were compared with the Wilcoxon test and Fisher's exact test. Disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with log-rank tests and Cox regression. RESULTS: Two hundred and two patients were treated for AML; 51 harbored IDH1/2 mutations. IDH1/2-mutated patients had significantly higher 2HG levels in serum, urine, bone marrow aspirates, and aspirate cell pellets than wild-type patients. A serum 2HG level greater than 534.5 ng/mL was 98.8% specific for the presence of an IDH1/2 mutation. Patients with IDH1/2-mutated AML treated with 7+3-based induction had a 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 44% and a 2-year OS rate of 57%. There was no difference in complete remission rates, EFS, or OS between IDH1/2-mutated and wild-type patients. Decreased serum 2HG levels on day 14 as a proportion of the baseline were significantly associated with improvements in EFS (P = .047) and OS (P = .019) in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with IDH1/2-mutated AML, 2HG levels are highly specific for the mutational status at diagnosis, and they have prognostic relevance in patients receiving standard chemotherapy.","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Capital Health, Trenton, New Jersey.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8420-9909'],20181113,,,"['T32 CA071345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['(c) 2018 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Levels of burden or depression were not different between groups. Burden was predicted by the presence of depression in the mother and severity of illness in both groups. In the leukemia group, mothers reported higher burden if the child was male or younger; no such relationship was observed in the CP group. CONCLUSION: Our results show that type of illness has an effect on levels of burden.

In this study, we aimed to develop a simple method for determining plasma ibrutinib concentration. The analysis required extraction of a 200 muL plasma sample and precipitation of proteins using solid-phase extraction. Ibrutinib and nilotinib, which was used as an internal standard, were separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.5% monopotassium phosphate (KH2 PO4 , pH 3.0; 52:48, v/v) on a Capcell Pack C18 MG II (250 x 4.6 mm) monitored at 260 nm, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The calibration curve was linear at the plasma concentration range of 10-500 ng/mL with a coefficient of determination (r(2) ) of 0.9999. The coefficients of intra-day and inter-day validation were 4.0-6.6 and 2.6-7.7%, respectively. The assay accuracy was -4.4-8.6%, and the recovery was >84%. This HPLC method coupled with ultraviolet (UV) detection for determining ibrutinib plasma concentration has several advantages such as simplicity and applicability to routine therapeutic drug monitoring at hospital laboratories.","['Department of Pharmacy, The Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0587-0091'],20181211,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: We reviewed information on cases from the central hospital offering cancer diagnostics and treatment in a major mining area of SA to describe their basic clinical and demographic characteristics, as part of assessing whether a cancer epidemiological study in this area would be feasible. METHODS: Basic clinical, demographic and residential information on patients with haematological malignancy diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 was collected retrospectively from the patient files at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg. RESULTS: In total, 1 880 patients aged 18 - 94 years were identified. Referral from distant provinces was not uncommon, but &gt;80% lived within 50 km of the hospital. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma accounted for 44% of the haematological malignancies, followed by leukaemia with 26%. HIV status was known for 93% of the patients, of whom 47% were HIV-positive. CONCLUSIONS: Caution is required when interpreting spatial distributions of patients, given inaccuracies in residential addresses and referral patterns to the hospital, and with HIV and other infections probable important confounders. Our study therefore shows that active case recruitment is required for accurate assessment of residential information. However, some findings on spatial distributions in the study warrant the continuation of efforts to develop a study protocol to investigate the possible link between uranium exposure in mining areas and haematological malignancies in residents. Disproportionately high incidence rates of haematological malignancies observed in specific districts would be relevant for further investigation.","['Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France. inamasut@fellows.iarc.fr.']",,20181002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the PML break point, usually located within intron 6, exon 6, or intron 3, different PML/RARA transcript isoforms may be generated, that is, long (bcr1), variant (bcr2), and short (bcr3), respectively. We report here the characterization of three APL cases harboring atypical PML/RARA transcripts, which were not clearly detectable after standard RT-PCR amplification. In all three cases, clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic features were consistent with APL. Direct sequencing allowed the identification of atypical break points within the PML and RARA genes. Then, we designed a patient-specific quantitative real-time PCR for the atypical transcripts, which allowed for specific quantitative evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) during follow-up. Despite the rarity of APL cases with an atypical PML/RARA fusion, our study indicates that an integrated laboratory approach, employing several diagnostic techniques is crucial to timely diagnose APL. This approach allows prompt initiation of specific targeted treatment and reliable MRD monitoring in atypical APL cases.","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Maria Goretti Hospital, Latina, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome.', 'Hematology Unit, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1936-3592'],20181204,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent literature has elucidated on the early palliative burdens of cancer, demonstrated the importance of complexity-based palliative referrals, and begun the conversation to define provider-specific roles. Herein, we describe a model that overlaps complexity with oncology capacity, to target specialty services to those who could benefit most.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment-free remission (TFR), the ability to maintain a molecular response (MR), occurs in approximately 50% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: A multicenter phase 2 trial (Delightedly Overcome CML Expert Stop TKI Trial: DOMEST Trial) was conducted to test the safety and efficacy of discontinuing imatinib. Patients with CML with a sustained MR of 4.0 or MR4.0-equivalent for at least 2 years and confirmed MR4.0 at the beginning of the study were enrolled. In the TFR phase, the international scale (IS) was regularly monitored by IS-PCR testing. Molecular recurrence was defined as the loss of MR4.0. Recurrent patients were immediately treated with dasatinib or other TKIs including imatinib. RESULTS: Of 110 enrolled patients, 99 were evaluable. The median time from diagnosis to discontinuation of imatinib was 103 months, and the median duration of imatinib therapy was 100 months. Molecular recurrence-free survival rates were 69.6%, 68.6% and 64.3% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. After discontinuation of imatinib therapy, 26 patients showed molecular recurrence, and 25 re-achieved deep MR after dasatinib treatment. Molecular response MR4.0 was achieved in 23 patients within 6 months and 25 patients within 12 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that a longer time from diagnosis to discontinuation of imatinib therapy (p = 0.0002) and long duration of imatinib therapy (p = 0.0029) predicted a favorable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: This DOMEST Trial showed the feasibility of TKI discontinuation in a Japanese clinical setting.","['Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kurashiki Central Hospital, Kurashiki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Obihiro Kosei Hospital, Obihiro, Japan.', 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Numazu City Hospital, Numazu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ogaki Municipal Hospital, Ogaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ome Municipal General Hospital, Ome, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Daiyukai General Hospital, Ichinomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Osaka Minami Medical Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujioka General Hospital, Fujioka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital, Matsuyama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, Mito, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Clinical Oncology, Steel Muroran Memorial Hospital, Muroran, Japan.', 'Department of Next Generation Hematology Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Okayama Municipal Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics, Department of Integrated Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics, Department of Integrated Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Tokai Central Hospital, Kakamigahara, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan. shkimu@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.']",,20181112,,,,,PMC6438937,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to identify pathways regulated by the activated Flt3 receptor for the discovery of new therapeutic targets. The Myc network of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is involved in mechanisms regulating proliferation and survival of cells, including that of the hematopoietic system. In this study, we evaluated the expression of the Myc oncogenes and Mxd antagonists in hematopoietic stem cell and myeloid progenitor populations in the Flt3-ITD-knockin myeloproliferative mouse model. Our data shows that the expression of Myc network genes is changed in Flt3-ITD mice compared with the wild type. Mycn is increased in multipotent progenitors and in the pre-GM compartment of myeloid progenitors in the ITD mice while the expression of several genes in the tumor suppressor Mxd family, including Mxd1, Mxd2, and Mxd4, is concomitantly downregulated, as well as the expression of the Mxd-related gene Mnt and the transcriptional activator Miz-1. LSKCD150(+)CD48(-) hematopoietic long-term stem cells are decreased in the Flt3-ITD cells while multipotent progenitors are increased. Of note, PKC412-mediated inhibition of Flt3-ITD signaling results in downregulation of cMyc and upregulation of the Myc antagonists Mxd1, Mxd2, and Mxd4. Our data provides new mechanistic insights into downstream alterations upon aberrant Flt3 signaling and rationale for combination therapies for tyrosine kinase inhibitors with Myc antagonists in treating AML.","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4355-230X'],20181021,,,,,PMC6215545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is used to treat over 15,000 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) per year. Donor graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect can prevent AML relapse; however, alloSCT is limited by significant toxicity related to conditioning intensity, immunosuppression, opportunistic infections, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Reducing the intensity of conditioning regimens prior to alloSCT has improved their tolerability, but does not alter the pattern of GVHD and has been associated with increased rates of graft rejection and relapse. Here, using a murine pre-clinical model, we describe a novel recipient conditioning approach combining reduced intensity conditioning with either genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NK cell numbers that permits efficient donor engraftment and promotes GVL without inducing GVHD. We show that NK cell-specific deletion of Bcl2 or Mcl1 in mice, or pharmacological inhibition of BCL2 impairs radio-resistant NK cell-mediated rejection of allogeneic engraftment and allows reduction of conditioning intensity below that associated with GVHD priming. The combination of reduced intensity conditioning and NK cell targeting in mice allowed successful donor T cell engraftment and protective immunity against AML while avoiding GVHD. These findings suggest that reduced conditioning in combination with targeted therapies against recipient NK cells may allow the delivery of effective alloSCT against AML while reducing the toxicities associated with more intensive conditioning including GVHD.","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China.', 'ACRF Translational Research Laboratory, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3050, Australia.', 'The Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'ACRF Translational Research Laboratory, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3050, Australia.', 'The Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'ACRF Translational Research Laboratory, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3050, Australia.', 'The Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery, Institute Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'The Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'ACRF Translational Research Laboratory, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3050, Australia.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) drive the initiation and perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional chemotherapy resulting in relapse(1-5). In this report, we show that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax + azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle manifested by decreased alpha-ketoglutarate and increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a patient population with historically poor outcomes.","['Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'RNA Bioscience Initiative, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'RNA Bioscience Initiative, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'RNA Bioscience Initiative, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.

However, ARID5B expression and clinical significance in ALL remain unclear. We found ARID5B is significantly down-regulated in ALL compared to healthy bone marrow controls. ARID5B also interacts with PHD finger protein 2 (PHF2). Low expression of ARID5B (ARID5B(low)) or ARID5B and PHF2 (ARID5B(low)PHF2(low)) is correlated with the markers of cell proliferation and poor prognosis in ALL patients. Ikaros directly regulates ARID5B expression in ALL. Restoring Ikaros function by Casein Kinase II inhibition also promotes ARID5B expression through recruitment of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) at its promoter region. In summary, our data show that aberrant expression of ARID5B and PHF2 is related to leukemic cell proliferation and several poor prognostic markers. Our data indicate ARID5B(low) expression, particularly ARID5B(low)PHF2(low) expression, is linked to Ikaros dysfunction and involved in the oncogenic effect of high-risk ALL, which may represent a high-risk subgroup of ALL.","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, 210009, Nanjing, China.

Here, we focused on specific subgroups of subjects carrying mutations in genes encoding transcription factors (RUNX1, CEBPalpha), signaling molecules (FTL3-ITD, RAS) and the nuclear protein NPM1).

Batf3-lineage CD8alpha(+) and CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs), in particular, are required for the spontaneous initiation of CD8(+) T cell priming against solid tumors. In contrast, little is known about the APCs that regulate CD8(+) T cell responses against hematological malignancies. Using an unbiased approach, we aimed to characterize the APCs responsible for regulating CD8(+) T cell responses in a syngeneic murine leukemia model. We show with single-cell resolution that CD8alpha(+) DCs alone acquire and cross-present leukemia Ags in vivo, culminating in the induction of leukemia-specific CD8(+) T cell tolerance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mere acquisition of leukemia cell cargo is associated with a unique transcriptional program that may be important in regulating tolerogenic CD8alpha(+) DC functions in mice with leukemia. Finally, we show that systemic CD8alpha(+) DC activation with a TLR3 agonist completely prevents their ability to generate leukemia-specific CD8(+) T cell tolerance in vivo, resulting instead in the induction of potent antileukemia T cell immunity and prolonged survival of leukemia-bearing mice. Together, our data reveal that Batf3-lineage DCs imprint disparate CD8(+) T cell fates in hosts with solid tumors versus systemic leukemia.","['Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; and.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; and.', 'Center for Research Informatics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; and.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; jkline@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; and.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1827-0247', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0034-7277']",20181112,,,"['R01 CA166770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007090/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000430/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6444187,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS1510113'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"To explore the role of type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), we generated Tr1 cells from naive CD4(+) T cells in donor mice that were subjected to stimulation of recipient interleukin (IL)-10 gene-modified dendritic cells (DCs). In animal models, the severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the group co-infused with DC-induced Tr1 cells was markedly milder than that in the groups without infusion of Tr1 cells. Moreover, the co-infusion Tr1 cells significantly prolonged the leukemia-free survival in tumor-bearing mice. Besides, Tr1-induced cells mediated the shift from T helper (Th)1 to Th2 cytokines in allo-BMT recipients. In Conclusions, our findings suggest that IL-10 gene-modified DC-induced Tr1 cells could inhibit GVHD while maintaining Graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) through mediating the shift of Th1/Th2 cytokines in an allo-BMT mice model.","['Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medcine, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medcine, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medcine, Shanghai 200092, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medcine, Shanghai 200092, PR China.

Among these effects, chemoprevention which represents the possibility to counteract the cancerogenetic process is one of the most studied. The extracts of mushroom Meripilus giganteus (MG) (Phylum of Basidiomycota) showed to exert antimicrobic, antioxidant and antiproliferative effects. Therefore, since its effect in leukemic cell lines has not been previously evaluated, we studied its potential chemopreventive effect in Jurkat and HL-60 cell lines. METHODS: MG ethanolic extract was characterized for its antioxidant activity and scavenging effect against different radical species. Moreover, its phenolic profile was evaluated by HPLC-MS-MS analyses. Flow cytometry (FCM) analyses of Jurkat and HL-60 cells treated with MG extract (0-750 mug/mL) for 24-72 h- allowed to evaluate its cytotoxicity, pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effect. To better characterize MG pro-apoptotic mechanism ROS intracellular level and the gene expression level of FAS, BAX and BCL2 were also evaluated. Moreover, to assess MG extract selectivity towards cancer cells, its cytotoxicity was also evaluated in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). RESULTS: MG extract induced apoptosis in Jurkat and HL-60 cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner by increasing BAX/BCL2 ratio, reducing ROS intracellular level and inducing FAS gene expression level. In fact, reduced ROS level is known to be related to the activation of apoptosis in leukemic cells by the involvement of death receptors. MG extract also induced cell-cycle arrest in HL-60 cells. Moreover, IC50 at 24 h treatment resulted 2 times higher in PBL than in leukemic cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that MG extract might be considered a promising and partially selective chemopreventive agent since it is able to modulate different mechanisms in transformed cells at concentrations lower than in non-transformed ones.","['Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Via San Donato 15, 40127, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Via San Donato 15, 40127, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Technology, University of Novi Sad, Bul.

However, BCR-ABL1 mutations can develop and cause secondary resistance to these inhibitors. For each of the available BCR-ABL1 inhibitors, certain mutations are known to be associated with resistance, although most mutations that confer resistance to one tyrosine kinase inhibitor remain sensitive to one or more of the other available inhibitors. For patients displaying poor response or loss of response to frontline treatment, the possibility that they have developed a new BCR-ABL1 mutation must be considered, and selection of a second-line treatment must consider the patient's mutational profile. Here we describe a case in which a patient developed a V299L mutation; although this mutation is known to be associated with resistance to dasatinib while remaining sensitive to nilotinib, limited information is currently available regarding the use of second-line nilotinib following development of a V299L mutation while receiving dasatinib. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man presenting with fatigue and drenching night sweats lasting for 2 weeks was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia based on an analysis of a bone marrow biopsy and detection of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in peripheral blood. The patient initiated frontline treatment with dasatinib. A good treatment response was seen initially, with a complete hematologic response by month 2 of treatment. By month 20 however, BCR-ABL1 transcript levels rose markedly, and a mutational analysis revealed a BCR-ABL1 V299L mutation. Based on the identification of this specific mutation, the patient switched treatment to nilotinib; by month 18 of nilotinib treatment, the patient achieved a deeper reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels than was seen with dasatinib. To date, in month 34 of treatment with nilotinib, the patient has shown good tolerance of the drug and has no clinical evidence of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our case report illustrates the benefit of having multiple drugs available to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, each with the ability to inhibit a distinct set of BCR-ABL1 mutations. This patient's case suggests that switching to nilotinib can be an effective treatment option for patients who develop a BCR-ABL1 V299L mutation while receiving dasatinib.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, SD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA. ahmed.galal@duke.edu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5962-5537'],20181112,,,,,PMC6233559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, European clinical guidelines and protocols recommend testing patients who achieve a complete hematological remission (CR) for MRD for the purpose of risk stratification. The aim of this study was to provide quantitative information regarding real-world clinical practice for MRD testing in five European countries. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted in March/April 2017 in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. The survey was developed after consultation with specialist clinicians and a review of published literature. Eligible clinicians (20 per country; 23 in Spain) were board-certified in hemato-oncology or hematology, had at least five years' experience in their current role after training, had treated at least two patients with B-cell precursor ALL in the 12 months before the survey or at least five patients in the last five years, and had experience of testing for MRD in clinical practice. RESULTS: MRD testing is now standard practice in the treatment of adult ALL across the five European countries, with common use of recent treatment protocols which specify testing. Respondents estimated that, among clinicians in their country who conduct MRD testing, 73% of patients in first CR (CR1) and 63% of patients in second or later CR (CR2+) are tested for MRD. The median time point reported as most commonly used for the first MRD test, to establish risk status and to determine a treatment plan was four weeks after the start of induction therapy. The timing and frequency of tests is similar across countries. An average of four or five post-CR1 tests per patient in the 12 months after the first MRD test were reported across countries. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive study of MRD testing patterns shows consistent practice across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK with respect to the timing and frequency of MRD testing, aligning with use of national protocols.

Although abnormalities in cytokine signaling are common in MPN, the pathophysiology of atypical MPN still remains elusive. Since deregulation of microRNAs is involved in the biology of various cancers, we studied the miRNome of aMPN patients. METHODS: MiRNome and mutations in epigenetic regulator genes ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, EZH2 and IDH1/2 were explored in aMPN patients. Epigenetic regulation of miR-10a and HOXB4 expression was investigated by treating hematopoietic cell lines with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine, valproic acid and retinoic acid. Functional effects of miR-10a overexpression on cell proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal were studied by transducing CD34(+) cells with lentiviral vectors encoding the pri-miR-10a precursor. RESULTS: MiR-10a was identified as the most significantly up-regulated microRNA in aMPN. MiR-10a expression correlated with that of HOXB4, sitting in the same genomic locus. The transcription of these two genes was increased by DNA demethylation and histone acetylation, both necessary for optimal expression induction by retinoic acid. Moreover, miR-10a and HOXB4 overexpression seemed associated with DNMT3A mutation in hematological malignancies. However, overexpression of miR-10a had no effect on proliferation, differentiation or self-renewal of normal hematopoietic progenitors. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-10a and HOXB4 are overexpressed in aMPN. This overexpression seems to be the result of abnormalities in epigenetic regulation mechanisms. Our data suggest that miR-10a could represent a simple marker of transcription at this genomic locus including HOXB4, widely recognized as involved in stem cell expansion.","['CHU de Bordeaux, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, F-33000, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1218, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""CHU de Bordeaux, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'INSERM U1218, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'INSERM U1035, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""Etablissement Francais du Sang - Aquitaine Limousin, Laboratoire R&D d'Ingenierie Cellulaire, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", ""CHRU d'Angers, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Angers, France."", ""CHU de Bordeaux, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'INSERM U1035, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""CHU de Bordeaux, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'INRA, Plateforme Genome Transcriptome de Bordeaux, BIOGECO, UMR 1202, F-33610, Cestas, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'INSERM U1218, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1218, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Bordeaux Institut National Polytechnique, F-33000, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. eric.lippert@chu-brest.fr.', ""CHU de Bordeaux, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, F-33000, Bordeaux, France. eric.lippert@chu-brest.fr."", ""CHRU de Brest, Service d'Hematologie Biologique et INSERM U1078, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France. eric.lippert@chu-brest.fr.""]",,20181112,,,,,PMC6233495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of MLL promotes leukemia as well as solid tumors in humans, highlighting the urgent need for the development of an MLL inhibitor. We screened and isolated MLL1-binding ssRNAs using SELEX (Systemic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment) technology. When sequences in sub-libraries were obtained using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the most enriched aptamers-APT1 and APT2-represented about 30% and 26% of sub-library populations, respectively. Motif analysis of the top 50 sequences provided a highly conserved sequence: 5-A[A/C][C/G][G/U][U/A]ACAGAGGG[U/A]GG[A/C] GAGUGGGU-3. APT1, APT2, and APT5 embracing this motif generated secondary structures with similar topological characteristics. We found that APT1 and APT2 have a good binding activity and the analysis using mutated aptamer variants showed that the site information in the central region was critical for binding. In vitro enzyme activity assay showed that APT1 and APT2 had MLL1 inhibitory activity. Three-dimensional structure prediction of APT1-MLL1 complex indicates multiple weak interactions formed between MLL1 SET domain and APT1. Our study confirmed that NGS-assisted SELEX is an efficient tool for aptamer screening and that aptamers could be useful in diagnosis and treatment of MLL1-mediated diseases.","['Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon 21936, Republic of Korea.', 'Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon 21936, Republic of Korea.', 'Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon 21936, Republic of Korea.', 'Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon 21936, Republic of Korea.', 'Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon 21936, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,,,PMC6430220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 25.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have achieved unprecedented efficacy in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); however, imatinib resistance has emerged as a major problem in the clinic. Because the overexpression of BCR-ABL1 critically contributes to CML pathogenesis and drug resistance, targeting the regulation of BCR-ABL1 gene expression may be an alternative therapeutic strategy. In this study, we found that the transcriptional repressor MXD1 showed low expression in CML patients and was negatively correlated with BCR-ABL1. Overexpression of MXD1 markedly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and sensitized the imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cell line to imatinib, with decreased BCR-ABL1 mRNA and protein expression. Further investigation using reporter gene analysis showed that MXD1 significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the BCR-ABL1 gene promoter. Taken together, these data show that MXD1 functions as a negative regulator of BCR-ABL1 expression and subsequently inhibits proliferation and sensitizes CML cells to imatinib treatment.","[""Shenzhen Bone Marrow Transplantation Public Service Platform, Shenzhen Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."", ""Shenzhen Bone Marrow Transplantation Public Service Platform, Shenzhen Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."", ""Shenzhen Bone Marrow Transplantation Public Service Platform, Shenzhen Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."", ""Shenzhen Bone Marrow Transplantation Public Service Platform, Shenzhen Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."", ""Shenzhen Bone Marrow Transplantation Public Service Platform, Shenzhen Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."", ""Shenzhen Bone Marrow Transplantation Public Service Platform, Shenzhen Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."", ""Shenzhen Bone Marrow Transplantation Public Service Platform, Shenzhen Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells, which are predominantly localized in the bone marrow. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are described to promote MM progression by immunosuppression and induction of angiogenesis. However, their direct role in drug resistance and tumor survival is still unknown. In this study, we performed co-culture experiments of myeloma cells with 5TMM derived MDSC in vitro, leading to increased survival and proliferation of MM cells. Co-culture experiments resulted in MDSC-induced AMPK phosphorylation in MM cells, which was associated with an increase in the anti-apoptotic factors MCL-1 and BCL-2, and the autophagy-marker LC3II. In addition, 5TMM cells inoculated in mice showed a clear upregulation of AMPK phosphorylation in vivo. Targeting the AMPK pathway by Compound C resulted in apoptosis of human myeloma cell lines, primary MM cells and 5TMM cells. Importantly, we observed that the tumor-promoting effect of MDSC was partially mediated by AMPK activation. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that MDSC directly increase the survival of MM cells, partially through AMPK activation, identifying this pathway as a new target in the treatment of MM patients.","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"The POZ-ZF transcription factor Kaiso was discovered two decades ago as a binding partner for p120(ctn). Since its discovery, roles for Kaiso in diverse biological processes (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, inflammation) and several signalling pathways (Wnt/beta-catenin, TGFbeta, EGFR, Notch) have emerged. While Kaiso's biological role in normal tissues has yet to be fully elucidated, Kaiso has been increasingly implicated in multiple human cancers including colon, prostate, ovarian, lung, breast and chronic myeloid leukemia. In the majority of human cancers investigated to date, high Kaiso expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics including proliferation and metastasis, and/or poor prognosis. More recently, interest in Kaiso stems from its apparent correlation with racial disparities in breast and prostate cancer incidence and survival outcomes in people of African Ancestry. This review discusses Kaiso's role in various cancers, and Kaiso's potential for driving racial disparities in incidence and/or outcomes in people of African ancestry.","['Department of Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, Center for Cancer Research, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL, USA.', 'Department of Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4K1, Canada.

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"Although air pollution is well known to be harmful to the lung and airways, it can also damage most other organ systems of the body. It is estimated that about 500,000 lung cancer deaths and 1.6 million COPD deaths can be attributed to air pollution, but air pollution may also account for 19% of all cardiovascular deaths and 21% of all stroke deaths. Air pollution has been linked to other malignancies, such as bladder cancer and childhood leukemia. Lung development in childhood is stymied with exposure to air pollutants, and poor lung development in children predicts lung impairment in adults. Air pollution is associated with reduced cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. Particulate matter in the air (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mum) is associated with delayed psychomotor development and lower child intelligence. Studies link air pollution with diabetes mellitus prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Pollution affects the immune system and is associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and autoimmunity. It is also associated with osteoporosis and bone fractures, conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, blepharitis, inflammatory bowel disease, increased intravascular coagulation, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Atopic and urticarial skin disease, acne, and skin aging are linked to air pollution. Air pollution is controllable and, therefore, many of these adverse health effects can be prevented.","['Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep and Allergy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL.

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"Methotrexate (MTX) is an anticancer drug that is widely used in a variety of cancers including primary central nervous system lymphoma. It is also administrated in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases. A simple, accurate, sensitive, and precise mixed hemimicelles dispersive micro-solid phase extraction was proposed for MTX quantification in human urine samples. MTX was quantified by spectrophotometer after dispersive micro-solid phase extraction using ionic liquid functionalized magnetic graphene oxide/polypyrrole. Interactions of adsorbent and MTX were modeled by molecular docking and the interaction energy was predicted to be -8.35kcal/mol. A larger absolute value of binding energy represents larger adsorption strength, indicating that graphene oxide nanosheets could perform higher adsorption strength toward MTX. The concentrations of MTX were proportional to analytical response in amounts ranging from 10 to 1000ng/mL with a good correlation (R(2)=0.99). Inter- and intra-day precisions and accuracies were within the acceptable limit according to FDA guideline (15% for biological determination). The recoveries were ranging from 89 to 93% and the method was specific for routine analysis of MTX. This protocol was applied to the urine of two patients under MTX therapy received an intravenous administration of 1mg/kg/dose of MTX with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The accuracy of the method was confirmed by HPLC measurements.","['Food and Drug Safety Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz 51664, Iran.

However some tumor cells are inherently resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, which needs to be addressed to establish TRAIL as a potential chemotherapeutic drug. In this study, our aim was to manipulate TRAIL-apoptosis pathway by hydroxychavicol (HCH), a polyphenol from Piper betel leaf, for the induction of apoptosis in TRAIL resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cell. When imatinib-resistant K562 cells were treated with HCH, it made these K562 cells sensitive to TRAIL. It was observed that HCH downregulated antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and FLIP, whereas the expression of TRAIL receptors, DR4 and DR5, remains unchanged. Moreover, we observed that reactive oxygen species or ROS played a crucial role in the downregulation of FLIP and XIAP because ROS scavenger significantly reversed the decrease of XIAP, and FLIP. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was observed to play a crucial role in the downregulation of XIAP and FLIP, as proteasomal inhibitor MG132 significantly reversed the downregulation of XIAP and FLIP.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated serous effusions occurring during the course of an already known hematologic neoplasia or as a first manifestation of it. We correlated cytology results with flow cytometry results, when available. In the absence of flow cytometry, our correlation was based on clinical follow up information obtained retrospectively. We evaluated our results in relation to the data of the literature and we considered some new suggestions for the improvement of cytology service. METHODS: Serous effusions in hematologic patients were retrieved from the files of the Department of Cytology, Laiko Hospital, for a period of 2 years. All patients had enrolled either a previous hematologic history, or a suspicious clinical and imaging status. Seventy-three serous effusions were included. Cytology reports consisting of morphology and immunocytochemistry assessment were correlated to flow cytometry results and, occasionally, to clinical follow-up. RESULTS: In the group of patients with previous history, sensitivity was 82.76%, positive predictive value was 100%, specificity 100%, and negative predictive value was 58.33%. In the group of patients without previous history, sensitivity and positive predictive value were both 91%, whereas specificity and negative predictive value could not be estimated. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that the diagnostic accuracy of cytology with the adjunct of immunocytochemistry is high compared to flow cytometry for detecting hematologic malignancies. In order to improve clinical performance, it is suggested that a cytology triage of serous effusions in all patients with hematologic malignancy must be implemented.","['Department of Cytopathology, Laiko Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Flow Cytometry-Immunology Department, Laiko Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Flow Cytometry-Immunology Department, Laiko Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Hematology Clinic, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Hematology Clinic, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Hematology Clinic, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Anatomy- Histology- Embryology, University of Ioannina, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Cytopathology, Laiko Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5207-1041'],20181112,,,['S10 OD016230/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

They constitute an economic burden for the patients, their relatives, and the society because of the cost associated with their management, which is usually long term. We aimed to determine the total direct cost of managing patients with premalignant hematological disorders (PMHDs) and malignant hematological disorders (MHDs). Materials and Methods: A hospital-based retrospective study was carried out between 1997 and 2015. Data were retrieved from the case notes of adult patients diagnosed with either PMHD or MHD. The total cost of medical care was calculated as the sum of in-patient and out-patient direct cost associated with their management. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Results: There was a total of 129 patients; 74 (57.4%) males and 55 (42.6%) females with mean age of 45.7 +/- 16.3 years and the majority (n = 76, 58.9%) being employed. Males were more affected than the females except in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The commonest MHD was chronic myeloid leukemia with 37 (28.7%) patients. Full blood count was the commonest investigation done, whereas free light chains were the least (n = 2; 1.6%). The total cost of care for the 129 patients was N30,041,900.00 ($82,306.58) with an average total cost of care per patient of N232,882.95 ($638.04). Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest mean cost of care per patient (N373,196.30; $1,022.46). The average monthly expenditure per patient was about N70,000 ($190). Conclusion: In our setting, management of CHDs constitutes an economic burden.","['Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Nigeria, Ituku Ozalla, Enugu, Enugu State, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu Teaching Hospital, Awka, Anambra, Nigeria.']",,,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"BACKGROUND: The presence of measurable residual disease after therapy is a significant risk factor of relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By detecting cells with leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP), multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) can detect residual leukemia at a level significantly lower than that detected by morphology. However, changes in LAIPs during or after therapy may pose a challenge to MRD testing. AML with mutated NPM1 represents the largest subtype of AML sharing a common leukemogenic mechanism and similar LAIPs. Here, we identified a common pattern of LAIPs in myeloid blasts with mutated NPM1, and studied its stability and limit of detection after therapy. METHODS: We summarized aberrancies of leukemic blasts with mutated NPM1 at diagnosis in 61 patients and paired relapse in 25 patients. In addition, we examined the detection of leukemic blasts in 590 specimens collected from 152 patients in complete remission after induction for AML/MDS-EB with mutated NPM1. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate myeloid blasts with mutated NPM1 have a characteristic pattern of LAIPs that is present in nearly all cases of AML/MDS-EB with mutated NPM1 at initial diagnosis and relapse, regardless of morphologic variations, FLT3 ITD status, or karyotype abnormality. The myeloid blasts with mutated NPM1 can be detected at an approximate level of 0.1% of total leukocytes in morphologic remission with high specificity validated by clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: The characteristic pattern of LAIPs of myeloid blasts with mutated NPM1 is common and stable, and allows sensitive and specific detection of AML or MDS with mutated NPM1 after therapy.

We explored the mechanism of action of BETi in cells expressing the t(8;21), and show that these compounds reduced the size of acute myeloid leukemia cells, triggered a rapid but reversible G0 /G1 arrest, and with time, cause cell death. Meta-analysis of PRO-seq data identified ribosomal genes, which are regulated by MYC, were downregulated within 3 hours of addition of the BETi. This reduction of MYC regulated metabolic genes coincided with the loss of mitochondrial respiration and large reductions in the glycolytic rate. In addition, gene expression analysis showed that transcription of BCL2 was rapidly affected by BETi but this did not cause dramatic increases in cell death. Cell cycle arrest, lowered metabolic activity, and reduced BCL2 levels suggested that a second compound was needed to push these cells over the apoptotic threshold. Indeed, low doses of the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, in combination with the BETi was a potent combination in t(8;21) containing cells. Thus, BET inhibitors that affect MYC and BCL2 expression should be considered for combination therapy with venetoclax.","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Morgridge Institute for Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Morgridge Institute for Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5621-1454'],20181111,,,"['UL1 TR000445/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI P30CA68485/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center', 'R01 CA205101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD018015/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA164605/National Cancer Institute', 'P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NIDDK P30DK58404/Vanderbilt Digestive Disease Research Center', 'R01CA178030/National Cancer Institute', 'UL1 RR024975-01/National Center for Research Resources', 'R01 CA178030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA185747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024975/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '2 UL1 TR000445-06/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences', 'R01 CA211082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PF-13-303-01-DMC/American Cancer Society', '5 T32 CA009582-31/National Cancer Institute', 'R01CA64140/National Cancer Institute', 'R01 CA164605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA064140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6513713,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS993670'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 11.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia in adults. AML cells secrete angiogenic factors to remodel vasculature and acquire chemoresistance; however, antiangiogenic drugs are often ineffective in AML treatment. Cancer cell-derived exosomes can induce angiogenesis, but their role in vascular remodeling during AML is unclear. Here, we found that exosomes secreted by AML cells promoted proliferation and migration and tube-forming activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas HUVECs conferred chemoresistance to AML cells. AML cell-derived exosomes contained vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) messenger RNA and induced VEGFR expression in HUVECs. Furthermore, they enhanced glycolysis, which correlated with HUVEC proliferation, tube formation, and resistance to apoptosis. Thus, AML cells secrete VEGF/VEGFR-containing exosomes that induce glycolysis in HUVECs leading to vascular remodeling and acquisition of chemoresistance. These findings may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting exosomes in AML.","['Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary Disease, Fuzhou General Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Hospital of Nanan City, Nanan, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2691-1147'],20181111,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) comprise a KAT sub-class that acetylate specific lysines in histones, hence playing an important role in the regulation of chromatin organization and function. HATs are critical regulators of signaling in many diseases, including cancer. KAT6A (also known as monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein, MOZ) and KAT6B (also known as MORF and QKF) belong to the MYST family of HATs, that comprise KAT5-KAT8. They are the targets of chromosomal translocations identified in acute myeloid leukaemia and various cancers. It seems logical therefore that inhibition of KAT6A and KAT6B may provide a therapeutic benefit in cancer. Baell et al. discovered a new class of anti-cancer drug that can put cancer cells into a permanent sleep or senescence, using high-throughput screening followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, in-cell assays, biochemical assessment of target engagement, and tumour models in mice and fish. This research showed promise in arresting tumour growth in pre-clinical models of blood and liver cancers as well as delaying or stopping relapse without damaging the cells' DNA or some harmful side-effects caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China.']",,20181102,,['Synth Syst Biotechnol. 2020 Oct 12;5(4):328.

In a subset of these cancer cells, Bcl-2 blocks Ca(2+)-mediated apoptosis by suppressing the function of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A peptide tool, called Bcl-2/IP3 receptor disruptor-2 (BIRD-2), was developed to disrupt Bcl-2/IP3R complexes, triggering pro-apoptotic Ca(2+) signals and killing Bcl-2-dependent cancer cells. In DLBCL cells, BIRD-2 sensitivity depended on the expression level of IP3R2 channels and constitutive IP3 signaling downstream of the B-cell receptor. However, other cellular pathways probably also contribute to BIRD-2-provoked cell death. Here, we examined whether BIRD-2-induced apoptosis depended on extracellular Ca(2+) and more particularly on store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), a Ca(2+)-influx pathway activated upon ER-store depletion. Excitingly, DPB162-AE, a SOCE inhibitor, suppressed BIRD-2-induced cell death in DLBCL cells. However, DPB162-AE not only inhibits SOCE but also depletes the ER Ca(2+) store. Treatment of the cells with YM-58483 and GSK-7975A, two selective SOCE inhibitors, did not protect against BIRD-2-induced apoptosis. Similar data were obtained by knocking down STIM1 using small interfering RNA. Yet, extracellular Ca(2+) contributed to BIRD-2 sensitivity in DLBCL, since the extracellular Ca(2+) buffer ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) blunted BIRD-2-triggered apoptosis. The protective effects observed with DPB162-AE are likely due to ER Ca(2+)-store depletion, since a similar protective effect could be obtained using the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Thus, both the ER Ca(2+)-store content and extracellular Ca(2+), but not SOCE, are critical factors underlying BIRD-2-provoked cell death.","['1Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven and Leuven Kanker Instituut, Leuven, 3000 Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '1Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven and Leuven Kanker Instituut, Leuven, 3000 Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '2Laboratory of Cellular Transport Systems, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, Leuven, 3000 Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '1Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven and Leuven Kanker Instituut, Leuven, 3000 Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '3The Laboratory for Developmental Neurobiology, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198 Japan.grid.474690.8', '2Laboratory of Cellular Transport Systems, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, Leuven, 3000 Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '1Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven and Leuven Kanker Instituut, Leuven, 3000 Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '1Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven and Leuven Kanker Instituut, Leuven, 3000 Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3591-4967', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5968-4828']",20181102,,,,,PMC6214954,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BTK-specific inhibitor Ibrutinib blocks BCR signaling and is now approved as effective B-CLL therapy. Chemokines, such as the homeostatic chemokine CXCL12, play a central role in B-CLL pathogenesis and progression, by regulating CLL cell interaction with the stromal microenvironment, leading to cells survival and proliferation. In this study, we investigated, in normal versus CLL B-lymphocytes, the role of BTK in signal transduction activated by the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis and its involvement in rapid integrin activation. We show that BTK is rapidly activated by CXCL12 in healthy as well as CLL B-lymphocytes, with a kinetic of tyr-phosphorylation coherent with rapid adhesion triggering. BTK inhibition prevents CXCL12-induced triggering of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) integrins. Furthermore, BTK inhibition blocks the activation of the small GTP-binding protein RhoA, controlling integrin affinity. Very importantly, we show that BTK tyr-phosphorylation and activation by CXCL12 depends on upstream activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase. A comparative analysis of 36 B-CLL patients demonstrates that JAK2-dependent BTK regulatory role on integrin activation by CXCL12 is fully conserved in CLL cells. Finally, we show that the JAK2-BTK axis also regulates signaling to integrin activation by BCR. Thus, BTK and JAK protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) manifest a hierarchical activity both in chemokine- as well as BCR-mediated integrin activation and dependent adhesion, potentially suggesting the possibility of combined therapeutic approaches to B-CLL treatment.","['Department of Medicine, Division of General Pathology, Laboratory of Cell Trafficking and Signal Transduction, University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'The Center for Biomedical Computing (CBMC), University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Pathology, Laboratory of Cell Trafficking and Signal Transduction, University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'The Center for Biomedical Computing (CBMC), University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cancer Research & Cell Biology Laboratory, University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cancer Research & Cell Biology Laboratory, University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cancer Research & Cell Biology Laboratory, University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Pathology, Laboratory of Cell Trafficking and Signal Transduction, University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.', 'The Center for Biomedical Computing (CBMC), University of Verona, Verona 37134, Italy.']",,20181012,,,,,PMC6205546,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"BACKGROUND: Treatments for childhood cancer have evolved over the past 50 years, with the goal of maximising the proportion of patients who achieve long-term survival, while minimising the adverse effects of therapy. We aimed to assess incidence patterns of serious chronic health conditions in long-term survivors of childhood cancer across three decades of diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We used data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a retrospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up of 5-year survivors of common childhood cancers (leukaemia, tumours of the CNS, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumour, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or bone tumours) who were diagnosed before the age of 21 years and from 1970 to 1999 in North America. We examined the cumulative incidence of severe to fatal chronic health conditions occurring up to 20 years post-diagnosis among survivors, compared by diagnosis decade. We used multivariable regression models to estimate hazard ratios per diagnosis decade, and we added treatment variables to assess whether treatment changes attenuated associations between diagnosis decade and chronic disease risk. FINDINGS: Among 23 601 survivors with a median follow-up of 21 years (IQR 15-25), the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 chronic condition decreased significantly from 33.2% (95% CI 32.0-34.3) in those diagnosed 1970-79 to 29.3% (28.4-30.2; p<0.0001) in 1980-89, and 27.5% (26.4-28.6; p=0.012 vs 1980-89) in 1990-99. By comparison, the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition in 5051 siblings was 4.6% (95% CI 3.9-5.2). The 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was lower for survivors diagnosed 1990-99 compared with those diagnosed 1970-79 for Hodgkin lymphoma (17.7% [95% CI 15.0-20.5] vs 26.4% [23.8-29.1]; p<0.0001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16.9% [14.0-19.7] vs 23.8% [19.9-27.7]; p=0.0053), astrocytoma (30.5% [27.8-33.2] vs 47.3% [42.9-51.7]; p<0.0001), Wilms tumour (11.9% [9.5-14.3] vs 17.6% [14.3-20.8]; p=0.034), soft tissue sarcoma (28.3% [23.5-33.1] vs 36.5% [31.5-41.4]; p=0.021), and osteosarcoma (65.6% [60.6-70.6] vs 87.5% [84.1-91.0]; p<0.0001). By contrast, the 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was higher (1990-99 vs 1970-79) for medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumour (58.9% [54.4-63.3] vs 42.9% [34.9-50.9]; p=0.00060), and neuroblastoma (25.0% [21.8-28.2] vs 18.0% [14.5-21.6]; p=0.0045). Results were consistent with changes in treatment as a significant mediator of the association between diagnosis decade and risk of grade 3-5 chronic conditions for astrocytoma (HR per decade without treatment in the model = 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.92; HR with treatment in the model=0.89, 95% CI 0.72-1.11; pmediation=0.0085) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HR without treatment=0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.85; HR with treatment=0.91, 95% CI 0.73-1.12; pmediation=0.024). Temporal decreases in 15-year cumulative incidence comparing survivors diagnosed 1970-79 to survivors diagnosed 1990-99 were noted for endocrinopathies (5.9% [5.3-6.4] vs 2.8% [2.5-3.2]; p<0.0001), subsequent malignant neoplasms (2.7% [2.3-3.1] vs 1.9% [1.6-2.2]; p=0.0033), musculoskeletal conditions (5.8% [5.2-6.4] vs 3.3% [2.9-3.6]; p<0.0001), and gastrointestinal conditions (2.3% [2.0-2.7] vs 1.5% [1.3-1.8]; p=0.00037), while hearing loss increased (3.0% [2.6-3.5] vs 5.7% [5.2-6.1]; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that more recently treated survivors of childhood cancer had improvements in health outcomes, consistent with efforts over the same time period to modify childhood cancer treatment regimens to maximise overall survival, while reducing risk of long-term adverse events. Continuing advances in cancer therapy offer promise of further reducing the risk of long-term adverse events in childhood cancer survivors. However, achieving long-term survival for childhood cancer continues to come at a cost for many survivors, emphasising the importance of long-term follow-up care for this population.

This is called conditioning lesion effect (CLE) and very much valued since it may provide new insights into neuron biology and axonal regeneration. There are established in vivo experimental paradigms to study CLE, however, there is a need to have an in vitro conditioning technique where CLE occurs in a maximally controlled environment. Mouse primary sensory neurons were isolated from lumbar 4-5 dorsal root ganglia and incubated at 37 degrees C on a silicon-coated watch glass that prevents cell attachment. After this conditioning period they were transferred to laminin coated culture dishes. Similar cultures were set up with freshly isolated neurons from control animals and from the animals that received a sciatic nerve cut 3 days earlier. All preparations were placed on a live cell imaging microscopy providing physiological conditions and photographed for 48 h. Axonal regeneration and neuronal survival was assessed. During the conditioning incubation period neurons remained in suspended aggregates and did not grow axons. The regeneration rate of the in vitro conditioned neurons was much higher than the in vivo conditioned and control preparations during the first day of normal incubation. However, higher regeneration rates were compromised by progressive substantial neuronal death in both types of conditioned cultures but not in the control preparations. By using neutralizing antibodies, we demonstrated that activity of endogenous leukemia inhibitory factor is essential for induction of CLE in this model.","['Faculty of Education, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.', 'Physiology Department, International School of Medicine, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey. gozturk@medipol.edu.tr.', 'Regenerative and Restorative Medicine Research Center (REMER), Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey. gozturk@medipol.edu.tr.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0352-1947'],20181110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: HULC is a multifunctional lncRNA that has pro-angiogenic function in various cancers. The present study was designed to see the role of lncRNA HULC in normal endothelial cells angiogenesis. METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, tube formation and expression levels of angiogenesis-related proteins were respectively assessed in human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells after lncRNA HULC was silenced by shRNA transfection. Cross-regulation between lncRNA HULC and miR-124, and between miR-124 and MCL-1 were detected by qRT-PCR, sequence analysis, and luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Silence of lncRNA HULC significantly reduced viability, migration, tube formation and protein levels of VEGF, VEGFR2, CD144 and eNOS in HMEC-1 cells. Meanwhile, silence of lncRNA HULC induced apoptosis in HMEC-1 cells, as Bcl-2 was down-regulated, Bax was up-regulated, and caspase-3 and -9 were cleaved. miR-124 expression was negatively regulated by lncRNA HULC, and HULC worked as a molecular sponge for miR-124, in having miR-124 exhausted. Besides, MCL-1 was a target gene of miR-124. Rescue assay results showed that the effects of lncRNA HULC silence on HMEC-1 cells growth, migration and angiogenesis were abolished by miR-124 suppression. Similarly, the effects of miR-124 on HMEC-1 cells were abolished by MCL-1 overexpression. Furthermore, MCL-1 activated PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a pro-angiogenic role of lncRNA HULC in endothelial cells. The pro-angiogenic actions of lncRNA HULC may be through sponging miR-124, preventing MCL-1 from degradation by miR-124.","['Department of Vascular Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'The 4th Department of Surgery, DongFang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Colorectal and Anal Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Chinayefeng0152@sohu.com.']",,20181109,,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a varied set of hematologic neoplasms and a high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 4-Amino-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl retinate (ATPR), a novel all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) derivative, play an important role in various types of cancer cells as a tumor inhibitor. However, little is known concerning its antitumor effect on MDS. The cell viability and the percentage of apoptotic cells were used to measure MTT, Flow Cytometry and Hoechst 33342/PI staining. In addition, real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyzed the expression of p53, as well as the levels of BNIP3, apoptosis proteins of Caspase-3, BAX and BCL-2. After SKM-1 cells were incubated with DAC, ATRA and ATPR, the viability of the SKM-1 cells was inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Both Hoechst staining and flow cytometry showed the apoptosis of SKM-1 cells was increased. Moreover, SKM-1 cells treated with ATPR unveiled elevated mRNA and protein levels of p53, BNIP3, BAX and Caspase-3 expression and decreased BCL-2 expression. However, silencing p53 suppressed the pro-apoptosis function of ATPR. Consequently, these data provide the first evidence for ATPR increased apoptosis in SKM-1 cells by p53 that is mutually dependent on and obligatorily linked to BNIP3 gene activation.","['School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China; Institute for Liver Disease of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"Despite a high remission rate after therapy, only 40-50% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients survive 5 years after diagnosis. The main cause of treatment failure is thought to be insufficient eradication of CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells. In order to induce preferential cell death in CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells, two separate events may be necessary: (1) inhibition of survival signals such as nuclear factor kappa-beta (NF-kappaB) and (2) induction of stress responses such as the oxidative stress response. Therefore, regimens that mediate both effects may be favorable. Deferasirox is a rationally designed oral iron chelator mainly used to reduce chronic iron overload in patients who receive long-term blood transfusions. Our study revealed that clinically relevant concentrations of deferasirox are cytotoxic in vitro to AML progenitor cells, but even more potent against the more primitive CD34(+)CD38(-) cell population. In addition, we found that deferasirox exerts its effect, at least in part, by inhibiting the NF-kappaB/hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha (HIF1alpha) pathway and by elevating reactive oxygen species levels. We believe that, pending further characterization, deferasirox can be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for eradicating CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells.","['Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Integrated Cancer Prevention Center and Department of Gastroenterology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"Adoptive immunotherapy has shown efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We conducted a prospective evaluation of cord blood (CB)-based adoptive cell therapy following salvage chemotherapy in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and describe the safety and early outcomes of this approach. To enhance the antileukemic effect, we selected CB units (CBUs) with a shared inherited paternal antigen (IPA) and/or noninherited maternal antigen (NIMA) match with the recipients. Furthermore, the CBUs had total nucleated cell (TNC) dose <2.5x10(7)/kg and were at least 4/6 HLA-matched with the patients; a higher allele-level match was preferred. Heavily pretreated adult patients with AML/MDS were enrolled. CBU searches were performed for 50 patients. CBUs with shared IPA targets were identified for all, and CBUs with NIMA matches were found for 80%. Twenty-one patients underwent treatment (AML, primary induction failure, n=8; refractory relapse, n=10, including 7 recipients of previous allogeneic HSCT; blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia, n=1; MDS, n=2). Most received combination chemotherapy; those not fit for intensive treatment received a hypomethylating agent. Response was defined as <10% residual blasts in hypocellular bone marrow at approximately 2 weeks after treatment. Ten of the 19 evaluable patients responded, including 5 of the 7 recipients of previous transplant. Response was seen in 4 of 4 patients with full CBU-derived chimerism, 2 of 2 of those with partial, low-level chimerism and 4 of 12 of the recipients with no detectable CBU chimerism. The most common adverse events were infections (bacterial, n=5; viral, n=2; fungal, n = 5). Grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 2 patients with full CBU chimerism; 2 other patients had grade 1 skin GVHD. A total of 11 patients died, 7 from disease recurrence and 4 from infections (1 early death; the other 3 in remission at the time of death). Overall, 12 patients proceeded to allogeneic HSCT; of those, 7 had responded to treatment, 3 had not (and had received additional therapy), and 2 had persistent minimal residual disease. In conclusion, the use of CB as adoptive immunotherapy in combination with salvage chemotherapy for patients with refractory AML/MDS is feasible, can induce disease control, can serve as a bridge to allogeneic HSCT, and has an acceptable incidence of adverse events. Alloreactivity was enhanced through the selection of CBUs targeting a shared IPA and/or NIMA match with the patients. CBUs with lower cell doses, already available in the CB bank and unlikely to be adequate grafts for adult transplants, can be used for cell therapy within a short time frame.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.

BACKGROUND: For individuals receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, the frequency of transitioning from Stage A to more advanced HF stages is not well described. METHODS: In 143 Stage A HF patients with breast cancer, lymphoma and leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, or sarcoma prior to and then at 3, 6, and 12 to 24 months after potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy was initiated, we obtained blinded cardiac magnetic resonance measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). RESULTS: Three months after potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy was initiated, 18.9% of patients transitioned from Stage A to Stage B HF. A total of 83% and 80% of patients with Stage A HF at 3 months, respectively, exhibited Stage A HF at 6 and 12 to 24 months; 68% and 56% of those with Stage B HF at 3 months, respectively, exhibited Stage B HF at 6 and 12 to 24 months (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.026, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning from Stage A to Stage B or remaining in Stage A HF 3 months after potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy was initiated relates to longer-term (6 to 24 months post-treatment) assessments of HF stage.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Department of Pathology, Section of Comparative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biostatistical Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biostatistical Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Department of Radiological Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology Division, Virginia Commonwealth University Health Sciences, Richmond, Virginia.

Epub 2018 Oct 11.,"BACKGROUND: Complete resection of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) offers the potential for cure after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients may not benefit and may experience severe toxicity. There are no validated molecular tools to allow better patient selection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LACE-Bio (LACE [Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation]) project includes 4 trials (International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial [IALT], Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association [ANITA], JBR10, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)-9633). Immunohistochemistry biomarkers shown in one trial to have a prognostic/predictive effect on overall survival were tested. RESULTS: The majority of the promising biomarkers could not be validated; the prognostic effect of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and beta-tubulin was confirmed. Potential causes include tissue fixation, storage, the use of tissue microarrays, and varying reagent/antibody batches. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry assays from single trials may be misleading and require validation before being used for patient selection. LACE-Bio-2 is evaluating potential genomic biomarkers that may allow more precise selection of patients with NSCLC for adjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC.","[""Canadian Cancer Trials Group, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"Disseminated neoplasia (DN) is a disease that affects bivalves worldwide and can lead to mass mortalities. In the present study, a pathological survey conducted from December 2011 to August 2012 in Crassostrea gasar, an oyster of commercial interest in northeast Brazil, revealed the occurrence of DN in oysters reared in the Mamanguape estuary, Paraiba State, Brazil. The present work describes the pathological and functional aspects of the disease in C. gasar by light microscopy (haemolymph cell monolayer and histological section) and flow cytometry analyses. The prevalence of the disease was low (7.1% of 182 oysters examined). Enlarged (neoplastic) cells showed reniform, ovoid or circular-shaped nuclei, with prominent nucleoli and predominantly short filipodia. They were found in the haemolymph and infiltrated the connective tissues of different organs, including the digestive system, gills and gonads, as well as in the sinuses and vessels. Three levels of progression of DN in tissues were observed, light (61.5%), moderate (15.4%) and advanced (23.1%). The viability of neoplastic cells circulating in the haemolymph (97.4%) was similar to that in the haemocytes (95.7%). The neoplastic cells showed low phagocytic ability (3.9%) compared with that of haemocytes (42.4%). Conversely, reactive oxygen species production (679 A.U.) and the total haemocyte count (3.9x10(6)cellsmL(-1)) were higher in the affected oysters than in unaffected oysters (268 A.U. and 1.5x10(6)cellsmL(-1), respectively). The low prevalence and primarily mild intensity found in the sampled oysters does not preclude an impact at the population level. A timely survey of DN is thus recommended in order to assess the severity and impact of this disease in wild and cultured populations of C. gasar oysters.","['Laboratorio de Imunologia e Patologia de Invertebrados (LABIPI), Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, 58051-900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.

Epub 2018 Nov 7.,"Albendazole (ABZ) is a microtubule-targeting anthelmintic that acts against a variety of human cancer cells, but the dependence of its cytotoxicity on non-mitotic effect remains elusive. Thus, we aimed to explore the mechanistic pathway underlying the cytotoxicity of ABZ in human leukemia U937 cells. ABZ-induced apoptosis of U937 cells was characterized by mitochondrial ROS generation, p38 MAPK activation, TNF-alpha upregulation and activation of the death receptor-mediated pathway. Meanwhile, ABZ induced tubulin depolymerization and G2/M cell cycle arrest. ABZ-induced SIRT3 degradation elicited ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation, leading to pyruvate kinase M2-mediated tristetraprolin (TTP) degradation. Inhibition of TTP-mediated TNF-alpha mRNA decay elicited TNF-alpha upregulation in ABZ-treated cells. Either the overexpression of SIRT3 or abolishment of ROS/p38 MAPK activation suppressed TNF-alpha upregulation and rescued the viability of ABZ-treated cells. In contrast to the inhibition of ROS/p38 MAPK pathway, SIRT3 overexpression attenuated tubulin depolymerization and G2/M arrest in ABZ-treated cells. Treatment with a SIRT3 inhibitor induced TNF-alpha upregulation and cell death without the induction of G2/M arrest in U937 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that ABZ-induced SIRT3 downregulation promotes its microtubule-destabilizing effect, and that the non-mitotic effect of ABZ largely triggers apoptosis of U937 cells via SIRT3/ROS/p38 MAPK/TTP axis-mediated TNF-alpha upregulation. Notably, the same pathway is involved in the ABZ-induced death of HL-60 cells.","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Fragrance and Cosmetic Science, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan.', 'Tissue Bank and BioBank, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan.

Epub 2018 Nov 10.,"T-cell receptor (TCR) beta repertoire analysis can distinguish monoclonal from polyclonal T-cell proliferations and crucially aid in the diagnosis of T-cell malignancies. TCR repertoire can be assessed either by flow cytometry (FCM), or by molecular genetic techniques. We compared the results of parallel analyses of Vbeta expression by FCM and TRB rearrangements by DNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 80 diagnostic peripheral blood samples of patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) for (1) the diagnosis of clonality and (2) the assessment of dominant Vbeta usage. FCM-based analysis of the surface expression was performed using the IOTest Beta Mark kit. The NGS-based analysis employed the multiplex Biomed-2 VB-JB primers. In all the samples, one or two clonal TRB rearrangements were detected by NGS. Although a dominant Vbeta domain usage was detected by FCM in only 41/80 (51%) samples, clonality was suspected in all of them. In a total of 12 cases, the FCM missed the clone detected by NGS, despite theoretical coverage by the antibodies, the functionality of the rearrangement, and the expression of TCRalphabeta on the cell surface. Partly overlapping with those cases, FCM discovered predominant Vbeta usage in the T-PLL population that differed from the one detected by NGS in 10 cases. Overall, the concordant NGS and FCM results were obtained on 61/80 (76%) of samples. We conclude that NGS-based TRB analysis can overcome certain limitations of FCM-based analysis by the identification of both productive and nonproductive rearrangements and by covering the whole Vbeta spectrum. Currently available FCM analysis of Vbeta expression lacks this breadth but has advantages, such as parallel immunophenotyping and a more accurate quantification of the Vbeta usage.

However, it has recently been reported that other genes, including DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C21 (DNAJC21), elongation factor-like 1 (EFL1) and signal recognition particle 54 (SRP54) are also associated with an SDS-like phenotype. Interestingly, SBDS, DNAJC21, EFL1 and SRP54 are involved in ribosome biogenesis: SBDS, through direct interaction with EFL1, promotes the release of the eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6) during ribosome maturation, DNAJC21 stabilizes the 80S ribosome, and SRP54 facilitates protein trafficking. These findings strengthen the postulate that SDS is a ribosomopathy. SDS is a multiple-organ disease mainly characterized by bone marrow failure, bone malformations, pancreatic insufficiency and cognitive disorders. Almost 15-20% of patients with SDS present myelodysplastic syndrome with a high risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. Unfortunately, besides bone marrow transplantation, no gene-based therapy for SDS has yet been developed. This review aims to recapitulate the recent findings on the molecular mechanisms of SDS underlying bone marrow failure, hematopoiesis and AML development and to draw a realistic picture of current perspectives.","['Cystic Fibrosis Center, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Via Conca 71, 60126, Torrette, Ancona, Italy.', 'Cystic Fibrosis Center, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Via Conca 71, 60126, Torrette, Ancona, Italy. marco.cipolli@ospedaliriuniti.marche.it.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6849-4487', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6646-421X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were examined for demographics, effect measures, and potential bias risk. Fixed and random-effects models were used to calculate adjusted OS and adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) estimates, respectively, among the different studies. Nine observational studies (four prospective and five retrospective) were identified. For patients with MDS, ICT was associated with an overall lower risk of mortality compared with no ICT (aHR 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.62; P < 0.01); however, there was significant heterogeneity across the studies. In studies reporting progression to AML, ICT was not associated with decreased risk of progression (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.31-1.43; P < 0.030). This systematic review and meta-analysis of nine nonrandomized trials demonstrated significant reduction in risk of mortality in patients with iron overload and low- or intermediate-risk MDS treated with ICT; however, a causal relationship cannot be established. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to more definitively evaluate the relationship between ICT and survival in patients with iron overload and low- or intermediate-risk MDS.","['Yale University School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven, New Haven, CT, USA. amer.zeidan@yale.edu.', 'Yale University School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Cardeza Foundation for Hematologic Research, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7017-8160'],20181109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) refers to the therapeutic use of T cells. T cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) constitute the most clinically advanced form of ACT approved to date for the treatment of CD19-positive leukaemias and lymphomas. CARs are synthetic receptors that are able to confer antigen-binding and activating functions on T cells with the aim of therapeutically targeting cancer cells. Several factors are essential for CAR T cell therapy to be effective, such as recruitment, activation, expansion and persistence of bioengineered T cells at the tumour site. Despite the advances made in CAR T cell therapy, however, most tumour entities still escape immune detection and elimination. A number of strategies counteracting these problems will need to be addressed in order to render T cell therapy effective in more situations than currently possible. Non-haematological tumours are also the subject of active investigation, but ACT has so far shown only marginal success rates in these cases. New approaches are needed to enhance the ability of ACT to target solid tumours without increasing toxicity, by improving recognition, infiltration, and persistence within tumours, as well as an enhanced resistance to the suppressive tumour microenvironment.","['Center of Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPS-M) and Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Lindwurmstrasse 2a, 80337, Munich, Germany.', 'Center of Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPS-M) and Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Lindwurmstrasse 2a, 80337, Munich, Germany.', 'Center of Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPS-M) and Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Lindwurmstrasse 2a, 80337, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Center of Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPS-M) and Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Lindwurmstrasse 2a, 80337, Munich, Germany.

We assessed the feasibility of developing contemporary risk models for SM based on clinical and integrated clinical-genetics information. Diagnosis of SM was per WHO criteria, and karyotype and next-generation sequencing data were available in a subset of the total 580 patients (median age, 55 years; range, 18-88 years) seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1968 and 2015. Morphologic subcategories were indolent/smoldering in 291 (50%) and ""advanced"" in 289 (50%): SM with an associated hematological neoplasm in 199, aggressive SM in 85, and mast cell leukemia in 5. Multivariable analysis of clinical variables identified age >60 years, advanced SM, thrombocytopenia <150 x 10(9)/L, anemia below sex-adjusted normal, and increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as independent risk factors for survival; respective hazard ratios (HRs) 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were 2.5 (1.9-3.4), 2.7 (1.8-4.0), 2.5 (1.9-3.4), 2.2 (1.6-3.1), and 2.1 (1.5-3.0). In addition, ASXL1 (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.6-7.6), RUNX1 (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.3-10.8), and NRAS (HR, 5.0, 95% CI, 1.5-13.2) mutations were independently associated with inferior survival. Combined clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular risk factor analysis confirmed the independent prognostic contribution of adverse mutations (2.6, 1.6-4.4), advanced SM (4.0, 1.8-10.0), thrombocytopenia (2.8, 1.7-4.5), increased ALP (2.1, 1.2-4.0), and age >60 years (2.2, 1.3-3.6). These data were subsequently used to develop clinical and hybrid clinical-molecular risk models.

To investigate the clinical relevance of these observations, we conducted an extensive immunogenetic analysis of multiple independent cohorts of HIV-1-, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-, and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected individuals in conjunction with in vitro assays of T cell survival, analysis of ex vivo KIR expression, and mathematical modeling of host-virus dynamics.

Epub 2018 Nov 9.,"Transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by the BCR-FGFR1 fusion kinase found in a variant of stem cell leukemia/lymphoma (SCLL) syndrome leads to development of B-lymphomas in syngeneic mice and humans. In this study, we show that the relatively rapid onset of this leukemia is potentially related to oncogenic domains within the BCR component. BCR recruited a guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain to the fusion kinase to facilitate activation of small GTPases such as the Ras homology gene family, member A (RHOA). Deletion of this GEF domain increased leukemogenesis, enhanced cell survival and proliferation, and promoted stem cell expansion and lymph node metastasis. This suggests that, in an SCLL context, the presence of the endogenous GEF motif leads to reduced leukemogenesis. Indeed, loss of the GEF domain suppressed activation of RHOA and PTEN, leading to increased activation of AKT. Loss of the GEF domain enhanced cell proliferation and invasion potential, which was also observed in cells in which RHOA is knocked down, supported by the observation that overexpression of RHOA leads to reduced viability and invasion. In vivo depletion of RHOA in SCLL cells significantly increased disease progression and shortened latency. Collectively, these data show that the BCR GEF domain affects phenotypes associated with progression of SCLL through suppression of RHOA signaling. SIGNIFICANCE: RHOA activation is a critical event in the progression of BCR-FGFR1-driven leukemogenesis in stem cell leukemia and lymphoma syndrome and is regulated by the BCR GEF domain.","['Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pathology, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia. jcowell@augusta.edu.']",,20181109,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6484845,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS1512605'],,,,,,,,,

The nanoparticles were prepared by conjugating 6-MP to carboxymethyl chitosan via a GSH-sensitive carbonyl vinyl sulfide linkage, ultrasonic self-assembly and surface decoration with folate. The TEM graphs shows that the as-synthesized nanoparticles are spherical with a particle size of 170~220 nm. In vitro drug release of nanoparticles demonstrated acceptable stability in PBS containing 20 muM GSH at pH 7.4. However, the cumulative drug release rate of the samples containing 20 mM and 10 mM GSH medium reached 78.9% and 64.8%, respectively, in pH 5.0 at 20 h. This indicated that this nano-sized system is highly sensitive to GSH. The inhibition ratio of folate-modified nanoparticles compared to unmodified nanoparticles was higher in cancer cells (human promyelocytic leukemia cells, HL-60) while their cytotoxicity was lower in normal cells (mouse fibroblast cell lines, L929). Furthermore, in vitro cancer cell incubation studies confirmed that folate-modified nanoparticles therapeutics were significantly more effective than unmodified nanoparticles therapeutics. Our results suggest that folate receptor-targeting and GSH-stimulation can significantly elevate tumour intracellular drug release. Therefore, folate-modified nanoparticles containing chemoradiotherapy is a potential treatment for leukemia therapy.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China. qwqunwang@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China. wqwangqun@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA. davoudi@iastate.edu.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China. zhenghua.whut@126.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China. uniteddealer@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China. qwqunwang@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China. uniteddealer@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China. iamnanomacro@gmail.com.', 'Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Antiviral Drugs, Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, Wuhan 430070, China. yuxiuxiang1970@163.com.', 'Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Antiviral Drugs, Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, Wuhan 430070, China. xiongjinghui@gmail.com.', 'Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA. qunwang@iastate.edu.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8657-7489'],20181108,,,"['51273156; 51373130/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '20171049720004/National Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for', 'Undergraduates', ""No. 348137/Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America Career Award"", 'No. RSGTMT17/PhRMA Foundation']",,PMC6266736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, HTLV-1 infection is a serious public health concern. Currently, diseases caused by HTLV-1 cannot be prevented or cured. Hence, there is a pressing need to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of HTLV-1 infection and intervention in host cell physiology. HTLV-1-encoded non-structural proteins that reside and function in the cellular membranes are of particular interest, because they alter cellular components, signaling pathways, and transcriptional mechanisms. Summarized herein is the current knowledge about the functions of the membrane-associated p8(I), p12(I), and p13(II) regulatory non-structural proteins. p12(I) resides in endomembranes and interacts with host proteins on the pathways of signal transduction, thus preventing immune responses to the virus. p8(I) is a proteolytic product of p12(I) residing in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to T-cell deactivation and participates in cellular conduits, enhancing virus transmission. p13(II) associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is proposed to function as a potassium channel. Potassium influx through p13(II) in the matrix causes membrane depolarization and triggers processes that lead to either T-cell activation or cell death through apoptosis.","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. erg54@cornell.edu.']",,20181108,,,"['P41 GM103521/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM123779/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AI137735/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM123779/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6274929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 6.,"Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver tumor in children, but treatment has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. We have previously demonstrated that Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia (PIM) kinases promote tumorigenesis in hepatoblastoma. Stem cell-like cancer cells (SCLCCs) are a subset of cells thought to be responsible for chemoresistance, metastasis, relapse, and recurrence. The aim of this study was to identify SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma and determine the role of PIM kinases in SCLCCs. Hepatoblastoma cells were separated into CD133-enriched and CD133-depleted populations and the frequency of SCLCCs was assessed. CD133 expression was determined in the presence or absence of the PIM inhibitor, AZD1208. The effects of AZD1208 on proliferation, apoptosis, and motility were assessed in vitro and the effect of AZD1208 on tumor growth was examined in vivo. We identified CD133 as a marker for SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma and showed that PIM kinases promote a SCLCC phenotype. PIM kinase inhibition with AZD1208 decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion and increased apoptosis in both SCLCCs and non-SCLCCs in a long-term passaged hepatoblastoma cell line and patient-derived xenograft. Additionally, tumor growth in mice implanted with hepatoblastoma SCLCCs was decreased with PIM inhibition such that 57% of the tumors regressed. These findings identify CD133 as a marker for SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma and provide evidence that inhibition of PIM kinases decreases stemness and tumorigenicity of SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma, making them potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of hepatoblastoma.","['Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.

In this work, 334 blood samples obtained in strip-dried form were used for bovine leucosis analysis with ELISA and real-time PCR methods. High percentage of seropositive animals (18.3%) let us estimate both indirect (serological) and direct methods applicability for the analysis of strip-dried blood samples and also to compare them (PCR results concurred with ELISA in 93.4% cases). Parallel analysis of native and corresponding strip-dried samples approved the proposed format as a reliable analytical way of sampling being in 100% concordance with conventional serum/whole blood ELISA and PCR analysis. Even distribution of antibodies against bovine leukemia virus along the membrane carrier was demonstrated by square-to-square analyzing of the sample strip (CV not exceeded 7%). Also, strip-dried blood samples showed enhanced stability at elevated temperatures comparing to liquid serum. The proposed strip-blood format is a promising way of sampling, storage and transportation and can find application in veterinary practice for infectious disease monitoring.","['Faculty of Chemistry, M.V.

Using single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we identify a master regulator, SPI1, the LSC-specific expression of which determines the molecular signature and activity of LSCs in the murine Pten-null T-ALL model. Although initiated by PTEN-controlled beta-catenin activation, Spi1 expression and LSC 'stemness' are maintained by a beta-catenin-SPI1-HAVCR2 regulatory circuit independent of the leukemogenic driver mutation. Perturbing any component of this circuit either genetically or pharmacologically can prevent LSC formation or eliminate existing LSCs. LSCs lose their 'stemness' when Spi1 expression is silenced by DNA methylation, but Spi1 expression can be reactivated by 5-AZ treatment. Importantly, similar regulatory mechanisms may be also present in human T-ALL.","['The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Drug Discovery Oncology, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Berlin, Germany.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking University, Beijing, China.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5199-1359', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3292-1413', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7545-7919']",20181109,,,,,PMC6251627,"['HZ, LZ, YW, BD, WG, MW, LY, XF, YT, XL, HW No competing interests declared, NL is', 'an employee of Bayer AG']","['(c) 2018, Zhu et al.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism underlying benzene-induced haematotoxicity, especially at low concentrations of chronic benzene exposure has not been well-elucidated. Here, we found that increased autophagy and decreased acetylation occurred in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) isolated from patients with chronic benzene exposure. We further showed in vitro that benzene metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ) could directly induce autophagy without apoptosis in BMMNCs and CD34(+) cells. This was mediated by reduction in acetylation of autophagy components through inhibiting the activity of acetyltransferase, p300. Furthermore, elevation of p300 expression by Momordica Antiviral Protein 30 Kd (MAP30) or chloroquine reduced HQ-induced autophagy. We further demonstrated that in vivo, MAP30 and chloroquine reversed benzene-induced autophagy and haematotoxicity in a mouse model. Taken together, these findings highlight increased autophagy as a novel mechanism for benzene-induced haematotoxicity and provide potential strategies to reverse this process for therapeutic benefits.","['Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Glycoconjugate Research Ministry of Public Health, Department of Biochemistry and Molecule Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9796-0184'],20181108,,,,,PMC6349156,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Dec 17.,"BACKGROUND: Skin diseases are frequent in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other hematological neoplasias. Eosinophilic dermatosis (ED) of hematologic malignancy has long been considered a nonspecific cutaneous reaction pattern. Recently neoplastic cells have been shown to be present in ED, thus challenging the classification as a nonspecific dermatosis. METHODS: We report five patients with ED in association with CLL. We further investigated the presence of neoplastic B-cells in the skin infiltrate by immunohistochemistry and immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement and compared these to extracutaneous manifestations of CLL. RESULTS: The phenotype of the lymphocytic infiltrate was predominately CD3+ (range: 60%-90%). CD20+ and CD79a+ lymphocytes were less frequent, accounting for up to 15% (range: absent - 15%). CD23+ lymphocytes represented up to 20% (range: absent - 20%) of the infiltrate. The analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement in the skin specimens showed clonal rearrangements in 4/5 patients and in three of these four patients clones were identical to extracutaneous CLL manifestations. CONCLUSION: Our data show that neoplastic B-cells are very frequently found in ED when systematically evaluated. This findings support the hypothesis that leukemic cells play a pathogenetic role in ED of hematologic malignancy.","['Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Departments of Dermatology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville and Box Hill Hospital - Monash University, Eastern Health Clinical School, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Institute for Surgical Pathology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4044-9094'],20181217,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSC) capable of regenerating leukemia is a major cause of relapse. There is a pressing need to better understand mechanisms of LSC regulation and their resistance to therapy in order to improve outcomes for leukemia. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a lethal myeloproliferative disorder that that is caused by hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transformation by the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has revolutionized CML treatment, but fails to eliminate LSC responsible for propagating and regenerating leukemia. Therefore, patients require continued treatment to prevent relapse. Leukemic and normal stem cells share properties of quiescence and self-renewal, that are supported by bone marrow niches. Persistence of LSC after TKI treatment is related to tyrosine kinase independent mechanisms which include intrinsic properties of LSCs determined by epigenetic alterations, altered transcriptional regulatory networks or mitochondrial/metabolic changes. In addition to cell intrinsic changes, signals from the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) play a critical role in protecting LSC from TKI treatment. Each type of alteration may offer potential points of intervention for therapeutic targeting of LSC.","['Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA. rbhatia@uabmc.edu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the feasibility or safety of using this mode of imaging guidance for percutaneous lung nodule biopsy in children has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate safety and diagnostic accuracy of percutaneous lung nodule biopsy in people treated at a pediatric hospital using cone-beam CT with navigational overlay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients from two large tertiary-care children's hospitals with lung nodules of 48 mm or smaller underwent percutaneous lung nodule biopsy using cone-beam CT with navigational overlay. We evaluated patient demographics, pre- and post-biopsy diagnoses, number of biopsy passes, complications, radiation exposure and technical success. RESULTS: Percutaneous lung nodule biopsy was performed for 37 nodules in 36 patients (23 males, 13 females, median age 15.5 years, range 8 months to 23 years). One patient underwent biopsy of two nodules at a single procedure. Median patient weight was 55 kg (range 8-97 kg). Pre-biopsy diagnoses included metastatic sarcoma or other solid tumor (n=11), leukemia/lymphoma (n=13), infection (n=10), chronic granulomatous disease (n=2) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD; n=1). Mean number of passes was 5 (range 2-15). Mean pre-procedure international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.1 and platelet count 193 x 10(9)/L. Diagnostic specimens were obtained in 32 of 36 patients (89%). Thirteen complications were encountered in 12 patients (33% of cohort), including 9 pneumothoraces (4 requiring chest tubes); 1 hemothorax, which required a chest tube; and 3 self-limited pulmonary hemorrhages. Mean and median radiation doses were as follows: fluoroscopy time 3 min and 2.4 min, dose-area product (DAP) (recorded in 31 patients) 23,402 Gy.cm(2) and 12,453 Gy.cm(2), and air kerma 88 mGy and 58 mGy. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous lung nodule needle biopsy can be performed accurately using cone-beam CT with navigational overlay.","[""Department of Radiology, Section of Interventional Radiology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, 4800 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA, 98145, USA. giridhar.shivaram@seattlechildrens.org."", 'Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Division of Interventional Radiology and Image-guided Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ""Department of Radiology, Section of Interventional Radiology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, 4800 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA, 98145, USA."", ""Department of Radiology, Section of Interventional Radiology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, 4800 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA, 98145, USA."", 'Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Division of Interventional Radiology and Image-guided Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3286-5394'],20181108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although efficient eradication programs have been successfully implemented in most European countries and Oceania, BLV infection rates are still high worldwide. BLV naturally infects cattle, inducing a persistent infection with diverse clinical outcomes. The virus infects lymphocytes and integrates a DNA intermediate as a provirus into the genome of the cells. Therefore, exposure to biological fluids contaminated with infected lymphocytes potentially spreads the virus. Vertical transmission may occur in utero or during delivery, and about 10% of calves born to BLV-infected dams are already infected at birth. Most frequently, transmission from dams to their offspring occurs through the ingestion of infected colostrum or milk. Therefore, although EBL is not a disease specific to the neonatal period, during this period the calves are at special risk of becoming infected, especially in dairy farms, where they ingest colostrum and/or raw milk either naturally or artificially. Calves infected during the first week of life could play an active role in early propagation of BLV to susceptible animals. This review discusses the main factors that contribute to neonatal BLV infection in dairy herds, as well as different approaches and management practices that could be implemented to reduce the risk of BLV transmission during this period, aiming to decrease BLV infection in dairy herds.","['Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria-Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria-Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria-Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria-Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria-Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",,20181025,,,,,PMC6209627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With an almost stagnant approach for the management of patients with AML in the last three decades, the main purpose of this paper is to increase our understanding of recent scientific advancements for the enhanced diagnosis and treatment of AML. Existing research data related to different approaches for a possible improvement in AML management has been collected and discussed. The identification of recurrently mutated genes, such as CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins alpha (CEBPalpha), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), and nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) along with the classic diagnostic karyotype has improved prognostic-risk stratification. Moreover, mutations affecting cellular metabolism like isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) have become a huge success by providing targets for novel therapeutic drugs. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) and vaccination against tumor-associated antigen are added options considered, which require further trials before their efficacy can be determined. An important tool in monitoring early response to therapy, minimal residual disease (MRD) assays can be further refined by including pretreatment parameters such as cytogenetic and molecular markers. Potential side effects and resistance to treatment remains a huge barrier in completely finding success against AML and work needs to be done to find combinations of immunotherapies to possibly reduce adaptive resistance by AML.","['Sindh Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.', 'Sindh Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.', 'Medicine, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.', 'Sindh Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.', 'Sindh Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.']",,20180824,,,,,PMC6207171,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that obese mice with syngeneic acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have poorer response to chemotherapy treatment than control mice. We therefore investigated whether dietary intervention could improve outcome from the most common pediatric cancer, ALL. Methods: Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice raised on a 60% calories from fat diet and control mice were implanted with syngeneic ALL cells. Some DIO mice were switched to the low-fat control diet. Survival from ALL was assessed without or with chemotherapy treatment starting at the time of the diet switch. Cells from DIO mice before and after diet switch were assessed by FACS for BrdU incorporation and phosphorylation status of AKT, S6K, and EIF2a. Similar experiments were done with human ALL xenografts. Mouse and human ALL cells were cultured in media with 10% or 5% fetal bovine serum, and sensitivity to chemotherapies assessed. Results: DIO mice had poorer survival (17%) after vincristine monotherapy than control mice on a 10% low fat diet (42%; n = 12/group; p = 0.09, log rank). However, switching obese mice to the low-fat diet prior to initiation of vincristine led to dramatically improved survival (92%, p < 0.01 vs both other groups). In vitro, FBS restriction made murine and human ALL cells more sensitive to vincristine. Interestingly, while serum restriction enhanced ALL sensitivity to dexamethasone and l-asparaginase, dietary switch did not improve survival of DIO mice treated with either drug in monotherapy. Thus, it appears that dietary intervention has a unique effect to improve ALL cell sensitivity to vincristine in vivo. Conclusions: We report herein that a dietary intervention can improve ALL outcome in a preclinical model. Further work is needed to identify the mechanisms of this effect and investigate potential impact on human leukemia in patients.","[""1Diabetes and Obesity Program, Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA.0000 0001 2156 6853grid.42505.36"", ""2Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA.0000 0001 2156 6853grid.42505.36"", 'Present Address: Cure 4 The Kids Foundation, Las Vegas, NV USA.', ""4Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, UCLA Children's Discovery and Innovation Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine UCLA, 10833 Le Conte Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1752 USA.0000 0000 9632 6718grid.19006.3e"", ""1Diabetes and Obesity Program, Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA.0000 0001 2156 6853grid.42505.36"", 'Present Address: Aptose Biosciences, San Diego, CA USA.', ""2Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA.0000 0001 2156 6853grid.42505.36"", ""1Diabetes and Obesity Program, Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA.0000 0001 2156 6853grid.42505.36"", ""4Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, UCLA Children's Discovery and Innovation Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine UCLA, 10833 Le Conte Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1752 USA.0000 0000 9632 6718grid.19006.3e""]",,20181101,,,"['R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6211598,"['All studies were approved by the CHLA IACUC and performed in accordance with the', 'US Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.Not', 'applicableThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer', 'Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and', 'institutional affiliations.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously created a rat model of cancer cachexia using MKN45cl85 and 85As2 cells derived from human gastric cancer. The 85As2 cells induced cachexia more potently compared to MKN45cl85 cells. To clarify the mechanism underlying the difference in the cachexia-inducing ability of these cells, we conducted DNA microarray analysis, focusing on cell proliferation and the production of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cachexia-inducing factor. The plasma human LIF levels of 85As2-induced cachexic rats increased as symptoms worsened, whereas the plasma levels of MKNcl85 were low. 85As2 cells displayed more genetic changes compared to MKN45cl85 cells, which were related to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/5 signaling. Stimulation of both cells with TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide) or TLR5 (flagellin) agonists did not affect proliferation. However, in 82As2 cells, LIF production was significantly increased by stimulation with TLR5, which was suppressed by an inhibitor of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1/4, which are important factors in the TLR5 signaling pathway. The increase in LIF production resulting from activation of the TLR5 signaling pathway may contribute to the cachexia-inducing ability of 85As2 cells.","['Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Tsumura Kampo Research Laboratories, Kampo Research & Development Division, Tsumura & Co., Inashiki-Gun, Ibaraki 300-1192, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology and Metabolic Disease, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology and Metabolic Disease, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Biomarker Discovery, Exploratory Oncology Research & Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.', 'Tsumura Kampo Research Laboratories, Kampo Research & Development Division, Tsumura & Co., Inashiki-Gun, Ibaraki 300-1192, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Supportive Care Research, Exploratory Oncology Research & Clinica l Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Innovation Center for Supportive, Palliative and Phychosocial Care, National Cancer Center Hospital, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",,20181005,,,,,PMC6205166,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST YU received a research grant and lecture fees from Tsumura', '& Co.

In this study, we investigated the emerging modes of ponatinib resistance in TKI-naive and dasatinib resistant BCR-ABL1+ cell lines. To investigate potential resistance mechanisms, ponatinib resistance was generated in BCR-ABL1+ cell-lines by long-term exposure to increasing concentrations of ponatinib. Two cell lines with prior dasatinib resistance demonstrated BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutation(s) upon exposure to ponatinib. In one of these cell lines the T315I mutation had emerged during dasatinib exposure. When further cultured with ponatinib, the T315I mutation level and BCR-ABL1 mRNA expression level were increased. In the other cell line, compound mutations G250E/E255K developed with ponatinib exposure. In contrast, the ponatinib resistant cell lines that had no prior exposure to other TKIs (TKI-naive) did not develop BCR-ABL1 KD mutations. Rather, both of these cell lines demonstrated Bcr-Abl-independent resistance via Axl overexpression. Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has previously been associated with imatinib and nilotinib resistance. Ponatinib sensitivity was restored following Axl inhibition or shRNA-mediated-knockdown of Axl, suggesting that Axl was the primary driver of resistance and a potential target for therapy in this setting.","['South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Cancer Theme, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Cancer Theme, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Cancer Theme, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Cancer Theme, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Cancer Theme, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Cancer Theme, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Discipline of Paediatrics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",,20181005,,,,,PMC6205183,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST D.L.W. receives research funding from Ariad, CSL, Novartis', 'and BMS; receives honoraria from and participates in advisory boards of Novartis', 'and BMS.

Its high efficacy stabilized disease in above 80% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients over 10 years survival. Due to the similar canceration of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) as to CML, imatinib has been approved to be used as first-line treatment. Study design: Our retrospective study was proposed to enroll 191 GIST patients with larger tumor size (>/=8 cm) who preoperative accepted imatinib from those with direct operation. Analysis included demographics, cancer specific survival and relationship of their risk factors. Results: Male patients and gastrointestinal (GI) tract location took higher proportion in total cases, detection of KIT mutant took 89.7% among all traceable genetic testing. Patients with preoperative imatinib can achieve higher cancer specific survival (CSS) after both in 1 year and 3 years duration than their counterpart. Tumor size above its threshold of 8 cm would be a hazardous factor for poor prognosis. Conclusion: In conclusion, as for regressing tumor progression and creating operative chance, preoperative imatinib should be considered for the patients with high risk, although the precise duration of this intervention needs further validation.","['Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Medical Image Center, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.']",,20181005,,,,,PMC6218762,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation with internal tandem duplication of fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3-ITD) is one of the two most common driver mutations and the presence of FLT3-ITD delivers poor prognosis. A number of ongoing clinical efforts are focused on FLT3 inhibitor use to improve the outcomes of this otherwise difficult leukemia. Midostaurin has been shown to improve outcomes in FLT3-mutated AML in the frontline setting. Several FLT3 inhibitors, especially second-generation agents, have shown clinically meaningful activity in relapsed or refractory AML and in patients not amenable to intensive therapy. In this article, we briefly review the biology of FLT3 in the physiological state and its role in leukemogenesis. We present a detailed review of current clinical evidence of FLT3 inhibitors and their use in the induction, treatment of relapsed or refractory disease, and maintenance setting.","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA, carlos-vigil@uiowa.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA, carlos-vigil@uiowa.edu.']",,20181016,,,,,PMC6198878,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In the present investigation, we fabricated a new oncolytic vaccinia virus (oVV-ING4), which expresses the inhibitor of growth family member 4 (ING4) and explored its antitumor activity individually and in combination with cytarabine in AML cells. Results: The experiments confirmed that oVV can efficiently and specifically infect leukemia cells, and augment the ING4 gene expression. Flow cytometry and western blot demonstrated that oVV-ING4 enhances apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in AML cells, and causes remarkable cancer cell death. In addition, the synergistic efficiency of oVV-ING4 and cytarabine was investigated in vitro and in vivo; the combination significantly inhibited the survival of leukemia cells in vitro and xenografted KG-1 AML tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion: In brief, oVV-ING4 can increase the sensitivity of leukemia cells to cytarabine and induce cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, oVV-ING4 may be a promising therapeutic candidate for leukemia and in combination with cytarabine represents a potential antitumor therapy.","['The Second Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com."", 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.', 'The Second Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com."", 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.', ""Department of Hematology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com."", 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.', 'The Second Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310015, China.', 'The Second Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com."", 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China, tongxiangmin@163.com.']",,20181015,,,,,PMC6199215,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to monitor the activity of PEG-ASNase in plasma and design an individualization project, a rapid and sensitive method to determine PEG-ASNase activity in plasma using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry was established. Methods: PEG-ASNase is commonly used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With Nessler's reagent as the chromogenic reagent of ammonia, a stable yellow complex was produced. The units of enzyme activity were defined as micromoles of ammonia released per minute. Results: Calibration curves fitted by plotting the OD at 450 nm of the Nessler product vs concentration were linear in the range of 27.8-1,111.0 IU/L with r (2)=0.999. The lower limit of quantification for PEG-ASNase activity in human plasma was 20 IU/L with good accuracy and precision. The intra- and interday precision (relative standard deviation) values were below 10% and accuracy ranged from 90% to 110% at all quality control levels. Analytical recoveries were determined between 90% and 110% for all quality control samples. Conclusion: This study proved that the Nessler method is well validated and can be successfully applied in the determination of plasma samples in the clinical setting for patients with ALL. It takes personalized nanomedicine to an entirely new level.","[""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210008, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210008, China, fyj322@189.cn."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210008, China, fyj322@189.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmaceutics, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmaceutics, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210008, China."", 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA, th.webster@neu.edu.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210008, China, fyj322@189.cn."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210008, China, fyj322@189.cn.']",,20181015,,,,,PMC6198885,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"Richter syndrome is the name given to the transformation of the most frequent type of leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, into an aggressive lymphoma. Patients with Richter syndrome have limited response to therapies and dismal survival. The underlying mechanisms of transformation are insufficiently understood and there is a major lack of knowledge regarding the roles of microRNA that have already proven to be causative for most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, by using four types of genomic platforms and independent sets of patients from three institutions, we identified microRNA involved in the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia to Richter syndrome. The expression signature is composed of miR-21, miR-150, miR-146b and miR-181b, with confirmed targets significantly enriched in pathways involved in cancer, immunity and inflammation. In addition, we demonstrated that genomic alterations may account for microRNA deregulation in a subset of cases of Richter syndrome. Furthermore, network analysis showed that Richter transformation leads to a complete rearrangement, resulting in a highly connected microRNA network. Functionally, ectopic overexpression of miR-21 increased proliferation of malignant B cells in multiple assays, while miR-150 and miR-26a were downregulated in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia xenogeneic mouse transplantation model. Together, our results suggest that Richter transformation is associated with significant expression and genomic loci alterations of microRNA involved in both malignancy and immunity.","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Present address - Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Pathology Department, IRCCS, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Universita della Svizzera italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Universita della Svizzera italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA gcalin@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNAs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",,20181108,,,"['R01 CA164346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3 TR000943/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM122775/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA222007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6518906,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"The oncoprotein BCR-ABL1 triggers chronic myeloid leukemia. It is clear that the disease relies on constitutive BCR-ABL1 kinase activity, but not all the interactors and regulators of the oncoprotein are known. We describe and validate a Drosophila leukemia model based on inducible human BCR-ABL1 expression controlled by tissue-specific promoters. The model was conceived to be a versatile tool for performing genetic screens. BCR-ABL1 expression in the developing eye interferes with ommatidia differentiation and expression in the hematopoietic precursors increases the number of circulating blood cells. We show that BCR-ABL1 interferes with the pathway of endogenous dAbl with which it shares the target protein Ena. Loss of function of ena or Dab, an upstream regulator of dAbl, respectively suppresses or enhances both the BCR-ABL1-dependent phenotypes. Importantly, in patients with leukemia decreased human Dab1 and Dab2 expression correlates with more severe disease and Dab1 expression reduces the proliferation of leukemia cells. Globally, these observations validate our Drosophila model, which promises to be an excellent system for performing unbiased genetic screens aimed at identifying new BCR-ABL1 interactors and regulators in order to better elucidate the mechanism of leukemia onset and progression.","['Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FABIT), University of Bologna, Italy roberto.bernardoni@unibo.it.', 'Health Sciences and Technology - Interdepartmental Center for Industrial Research (HST-ICIR), University of Bologna, Ozzano Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FABIT), University of Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Present address: Department of Biological Sciences, School of Applied Sciences, University of Huddersfield, Queensgate, UK.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FABIT), University of Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FABIT), University of Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/INSERM/ULP 67404 Illkirch, France.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FABIT), University of Bologna, Italy.', 'Health Sciences and Technology - Interdepartmental Center for Industrial Research (HST-ICIR), University of Bologna, Ozzano Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy daniela.cilloni@unito.it.']",,20181108,,,['P40 OD018537/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6442973,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"PURPOSE: A few previous studies report a direct relationship between older age and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. This study further evaluated this adverse event's age-based risk. METHODS: CALGB 40101 investigated adjuvant paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) once per week or 175 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks) in patients with breast cancer and served as a platform for the current study that investigated age-based differences in neuropathy. Grade 2 or worse neuropathy, as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4, was the primary endpoint; patients were assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 15 years. RESULTS: Among these 1,881 patients, 230 were 65 years of age or older, 556 were 55-64 years, and 1,095 were younger than 55; 1,226 neuropathy events (commonly grade 1 or 2) were reported in 65% of the cohort. The number of grade 2 or worse events was 63 (27%), 155 (28%), and 266 (24%) within respective age groups (p = .14). In univariate analysis, only motor neuropathy had a higher age-based incidence: 19 (8%), 43 (8%), and 60 (5%), respectively (p = .04); in multivariate analyses, this association was no longer statistically significant. Other endpoints, such as time to onset of neuropathy (time from trial enrollment to neuropathy development) and time to improvement (time from maximal grade sensory neuropathy to a one-category improvement), showed no statistically significant age-based differences. In contrast, obesity was associated with neuropathy, and every 2-week paclitaxel was associated with trends toward neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Although paclitaxel-induced neuropathy is common, older age is not an independent risk factor. Clinical trial identification number. NCT00041119 (CALGB 40101).

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"Preclinical models have shown that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 pathways enhances antileukemic responses. Azacitidine upregulates PD-1 and IFNgamma signaling. We therefore conducted this single-arm trial, in which patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated with azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) days 1 to 7 intravenously or subcutaneously with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 14, every 4 to 6 weeks. For the seventy patients who were treated, the median age was 70 years (range, 22-90) and the median number of prior therapies received was 2 (range, 1-7). The overall response rate (ORR) was 33%, including 15 (22%) complete remission/complete remission with insufficient recovery of counts, 1 partial response, and 7 patients with hematologic improvement maintained >6 months. Six patients (9%) had stable disease >6 months. The ORR was 58% and 22%, in hypomethylating agent (HMA)-naive (n = 25) and HMA-pretreated (n = 45) patients, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 8 (11%) patients. Pretherapy bone marrow and peripheral blood CD3 and CD8 were significantly predictive for response on flow cytometry. CTLA4 was significantly upregulated on CD4(+) Teff in nonresponders after 2 and 4 doses of nivolumab. Azacitidine and nivolumab therapy produced an encouraging response rate and overall survival in patients with R/R AML, particularly in HMA-naive and salvage 1 patients. Pretherapy bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood CD3 percentage may be biomarkers for patient selection. SIGNIFICANCE: Azacitidine in combination with nivolumab appeared to be a safe and effective therapy in patients with AML who were salvage 1, prior hypomethylator-naive, or had increased pretherapy CD3(+) bone marrow infiltrate by flow cytometry or IHC. Bone marrow CD3 and CD8 are relatively simple assays that should be incorporated to select patients in future trials.

Epub 2018 Oct 13.,"BACKGROUND: As oral targeted agents, such as ibrutinib, become more widely used, understanding the impact of suboptimal dosing on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) outside of clinical trials is imperative. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on ibrutinib discontinuation, dose reductions, and treatment interruptions were collected on 170 non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 115, 64%) patients treated with ibrutinib at a single institution. Ibrutinib dose adherence was calculated as the proportion of days in which ibrutinib was administered out of the total number of days ibrutinib was prescribed in the first 8 weeks. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to compare conditional survival outcomes beyond 8 weeks in patients with >/= 80% dose adherence and patients with < 80% dose adherence. RESULTS: Median OS among those who discontinued therapy for progression was poor (n = 51, 1.7 months; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-3.7). Lower dose adherence (< 80%) was associated with significantly worse PFS (P = .002) and OS (P = .021). However, among CLL patients, lower dose adherence was only associated with worse PFS (P = .043). Patients with early dose reductions had significantly worse PFS (P = .004) and OS (P = .014). Patients with dose interruptions lasting > 1 week had worse PFS (P = .047) but not OS (P = .577). CONCLUSION: In this observational study, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL patients experienced poor outcomes after discontinuing ibrutinib for disease progression. The inferior survival related to suboptimal dose adherence of ibrutinib was predominantly due to early dose reduction. These data confirm poor survival in CLL and lymphoma patients alike after ibrutinib discontinuation, and support recommendations for full dose at treatment initiation.","['Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"OBJECTIVES: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the main culprit in cancers of the cervix, penis, anus, skin, eye and head and neck. Current treatments for HPV cancers have not altered survival outcomes for 30years and there is a significant lack of targeted therapeutic agents in the management of advanced HPV-related HNSCC. Here we show that survival and maintenance of HPV-positive HNC cells relies on the continuous expression of the major HPV oncogene, E7, and that Aurora kinases are critical for survival of high-risk HPV-positive HNC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess the role of HPV E7 on HNC cell survival, RNA interference (RNAi) of the E7 gene was initially performed. Using an Aurora kinase inhibitor, Alisertib, the role of Aurora kinases in the carcinogenesis of HPV E7 positive HNC tumour lines was then investigated. An in vivo HNC xenograft model was also utilised to assess loss of tumour volume in response to RNAi E7 gene silencing and Alisertib treatment. RESULTS: RNAi silencing of the HPV E7 gene inhibited the growth of HPV-positive HNC cells and in vivo tumour load. We show that HPV E7 oncogene expression confers sensitivity to Alisertib on HNC cells where Alisertib-mediated loss in in vitro cell viability and in vivo tumour load is dependent on E7 expression. Moreover, Aurora kinase inhibition induced degradation of MCL-1 in HPV E7-expressing HNC cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, we show that Aurora kinases are a novel therapeutic target for HPV-positive HNCs. It might be feasible to combine Aurora kinase and MCL-1 inhibitors for future HNC therapies.","['Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia; Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia; Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kaifeng Central Hospital, Kaifeng City, China.', ""Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia; Dental Institute, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.', 'Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology, VCU Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Dentistry, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.

This study was performed in vivo in two human xenograft acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models and in vitro using HL60 and U937 cell lines. RESULTS: Qu treatment almost eliminates DNMT1 and DNMT3a expression, and this regulation was in part STAT-3 dependent. The treatment also downregulated class I HDACs. Furthermore, treatment of the cell lines with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, together with Qu prevented degradation of class I HDACs compared to cells treated with Qu alone, indicating increased proteasome degradation of class I HDACS by Qu. Qu induced demethylation of the pro-apoptotic BCL2L11, DAPK1 genes, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, Qu (50 mumol/L) treatment of cell lines for 48 h caused accumulation of acetylated histone 3 and histone 4, resulting in three- to ten fold increases in the promoter region of DAPK1, BCL2L11, BAX, APAF1, BNIP3, and BNIP3L. In addition, Qu treatment significantly increased the mRNA levels of all these genes, when compared to cells treated with vehicle only (control cells) (*p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results showed that enhanced apoptosis, induced by Qu, might be caused in part by its DNA demethylating activity, by HDAC inhibition, and by the enrichment of H3ac and H4ac in the promoter regions of genes involved in the apoptosis pathway, leading to their transcription activation.","['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Rua Carlos Chagas, 480, CEP, Campinas, SP, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Rua Carlos Chagas, 480, CEP, Campinas, SP, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Rua Carlos Chagas, 480, CEP, Campinas, SP, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Rua Carlos Chagas, 480, CEP, Campinas, SP, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Rua Carlos Chagas, 480, CEP, Campinas, SP, 13083-878, Brazil. sara@unicamp.br.']",,20181108,,,,,PMC6225654,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the large amount of obtained data requires extensive bioinformatics analysis. In this work, we established an approach combining amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), AFLP in silico and next generation sequencing (NGS) methods to map the malignant genome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. We compared the unique DNA fingerprints of patients generated by the AFLP technique approach with those of healthy donors to identify AFLP markers associated with the disease and/or the response to treatment with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Among the statistically significant AFLP markers selected for NGS analysis and virtual fingerprinting, we identified the sequences of three fragments in the region of DNA repeat element OldhAT1, LINE L1M7, LTR MER90, and satellite ALR/Alpha among repetitive elements, which may indicate a role of these non-coding repetitive sequences in hematological malignancy. SNPs leading to the presence/absence of these fragments were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. When evaluating the results of AFLP analysis for some fragments, we faced the frequently discussed size homoplasy, resulting in co-migration of non-identical AFLP fragments that may originate from an insertion/deletion, SNP, somatic mutation anywhere in the genome, or combination thereof. The AFLP-AFLP in silico-NGS procedure represents a smart alternative to microarrays and relatively expensive and bioinformatically challenging whole-genome sequencing to detect the association of variable regions of the human genome with diseases.","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6961-4551'],20181108,,,,,PMC6224067,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also a well-known risk factor in pediatric hematologic malignancy, acute myelogenous leukemia, recurrent disease and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We previously revealed that a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia, recurrent disease and >10 years of age were risk factors for IFI in patients with pediatric hematologic malignancies. We examined and compared the incidence, risk factors and mortality rate from IFI between 276 patients from 2007 to 2016 and patients in our past report. The cumulative incidence of IFI was 10.5%; this comprised cases of probable and possible IFI at rates of 5.1% and 5.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age >9 years at admission, recurrent disease and acute myelogenous leukemia diagnosis were risk factors for IFI. Similar to the results of the previous study, multivariate analysis showed that each of these 3 variables was an independent predictor of IFI. The survival rate was lower in patients with IFI than in those without IFI (38.8% versus 69.9%; P < 0.001). However, IFI was a direct cause of death in only 2 patients. Although 11 patients received stem cell transplantation after IFI treatment, only 2 patients have survived, and the other 9 patients died of other complications.","['From the Department of Hematology/Oncology for Children and Adolescents, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Shiroishiku, Sapporo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the CLL-IPI in 897 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL in 3 randomized trials testing idelalisib (PI3Kdelta inhibitor). The CLL-IPI identified patients as low (2.2%), intermediate (12.8%), high (48.7%), and very high (36.2%) risk and was prognostic for survival (log-rank p < .0001; C-statistic 0.706). Of CLL-IPI factors, age >65, beta2-microglobulin >3.5mg/L, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene, and deletion 17p/TP53 mutation were independently prognostic, but Rai I-IV or Binet B/C was not. The CLL-IPI is prognostic for survival in relapsed CLL and with idelalisib therapy.

In particular, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma is a very common malignancy in the Western hemisphere, and most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma have an indolent course and behavior. However, 2% to 8% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma cases transform. Histiocytic sarcomatous transformation is rare and portends poor prognosis. OBJECTIVE.-: To review the clinical features, morphology, and key points related to the differential diagnosis for histiocytic sarcoma. We discuss recent understanding of the biology underlying transformation. DATA SOURCES.-: University of Michigan case and review of pertinent literature about histiocytic sarcoma and morphologic differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS.-: Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare histiocytic neoplasm that can arise as a result of transdifferentiation from low-grade B-cell lymphomas, and has a wide differential diagnosis including other histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms, myeloid neoplasms, lymphomas, melanoma, and carcinoma. However, some key morphologic and immunohistochemical features allow for accurate classification.","['From the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Dec 3.,"BACKGROUND: Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies worldwide. Studies have shown that the incidence of peanut allergies in Western-born Asians is higher than that in Asia-born Asians. Notably, Europeans and Americans mostly eat roasted peanuts, whereas Asians mostly eat boiled or fried peanuts. RESULTS: BALB/c mice were sensitized using purified protein from raw, roasted or boiled peanuts, then fed the same by oral gavage. The relevant allergic reactions were studied using BALB/c mice model, including a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell model, simulated gastric fluid experiments, and ultraviolet (UV) and circular dichroism (CD) spectral analysis. Serological studies showed increased levels of immunoglobulin E, interleukin-4 and interleukin-5, and pathological studies showed mast cell degranulation and inflammatory changes in jejunal tissues, with an increase in thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene expression in all treatment groups compared with the control group (phosphate-buffered saline). Compared with the raw peanut group, sera from the roasted peanut group produced a significant increase in RBL beta-hexosaminidase A release in vitro, and roasted peanuts showed increased resistance to digestion in simulated gastric fluid experiments. Ultraviolet and CD spectral analyses showed that the roasting and boiling processes altered the structure of the major peanut allergens, which may have contributed to the differences observed in peanut allergenicity. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that peanut allergies are related to peanut thermal processing methods. In our mouse model, the raw, roasted and boiled peanuts elicited different degrees of allergic response. Compared with raw peanut, roasted peanuts show a higher allergenicity, whereas the boiled peanuts show a lower allergenicity.

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is characterized by expression of CD5 on clonal B cells, and is partly driven by activated B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling. While CD5 is known to be a negative regulator of BCR signalling, it is unknown if variability in CD5 expression exists among patients and whether CLL cell CD5 expression affects CLL clinical outcomes. We assessed the extent to which CD5 expression is correlated with clinical outcomes, and whether this information adds to currently used prognostic markers. We evaluated CD5 expression from 1275 blood samples, established prognostic markers and time to event data from 423 CLL patients followed at the Duke University and Durham VA Medical Centers. CD5 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was largely stable over time in individual patients, but ranged between 0.5 and 760 in the entire cohort. Lower CD5 MFI was significantly associated with a shorter time to first therapy.

However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity are common toxicities which are potentially life-threatening in severe cases. Risk factors for CRS and neurotoxicity identified so far include disease burden, lymphodepletion intensity and CAR-T cell dose administered. Risk-adapted dosing, with lower CAR-T cell doses administered to B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients with high marrow blast counts, has been successful at decreasing severe CRS rates in this population. Intervention with therapies, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, have been effective at ameliorating toxicity, enabling CAR-T cells to be administered safely to many patients without significantly compromising efficacy. Deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of underlying CRS and neurotoxicity will enable the development of novel approaches to reduce toxicity and improve outcomes.","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9398-2677'],20181108,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Developed for the stem cell community, it has a major focus on pluripotency, tissue stem cells, and staged differentiation. Stemformatics includes curated 'collections' of data relevant to cell reprogramming, as well as hematopoiesis and leukaemia. Rather than simply rehosting datasets as they appear in public repositories, Stemformatics uses a stringent set of quality control metrics and its own pipelines to process handpicked datasets from raw files. This means that about 30% of datasets processed by Stemformatics fail the quality control metrics and never make it to the portal, ensuring that Stemformatics data are of high quality and have been processed in a consistent manner. Stemformatics provides easy-to-use and intuitive tools for biologists to visually explore the data, including interactive gene expression profiles, principal component analysis plots and hierarchical clusters, among others. The addition of tools that facilitate cross-dataset comparisons provides users with snapshots of gene expression in multiple cell and tissues, assisting the identification of cell-type restricted genes, or potential housekeeping genes.

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of the antimicrobial treatment in early discharge vs. in-hospital treatment in children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN) with low risk of invasive bacterial infection (IBI). Methods: Quasi-experimental design with a historical cohort control group. Children with cancer during an episode of FN and low risk of IBI were included. The control group were inpatient children that received intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam. The experimental group was early discharge patients, who received 48 h of IV treatment and were switched to oral treatment. Outcomes: fever resolution, readmissions, and mortality. Results: Eighty low-risk FN episodes were included; the median age was 6 years old (2.6-11 years), and 43 (54%) were female. Main diagnoses were solid tumors (52 patients) and leukemia or lymphoma (28 patients). Forty-three patients received in-hospital treatment, and 37 were selected for early discharge (31 patients received ciprofloxacin and six received amoxicillin/clavulanate). Two patients were readmitted, one due to a relapse of fever with tumor progression and the other due to epistaxis. Adverse effects occurred in 21.6% of the early discharge group and 12% of the inpatient treatment group (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Early discharge in pediatric patients with cancer, fever, and neutropenia is an acceptable and safe alternative for low-risk patients.","['Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad del Bajio, Leon, Guanajuato.', 'Departamento de Infectologia, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City.', 'Unidad de Investigacion en Medicina Basada en Evidencias, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Secretaria de Salud, Mexico City.', 'Unidad de Investigacion en Analisis y Sintesis de la Evidencia, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, IMSS, Coordinacion de Investigacion, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City.', 'Departamento de Oncologia, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City.

Methods: A descriptive and survival study of 210 acute leukemia patients diagnosed and treated during 2008-2012 was performed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were developed for all patients, each leukemia type (B, T and myeloid) and for B type related to risk group, age, sex, leukocytes, cell markers, DNA index, karyotype, and translocations. Results: Age, gender and proportion of leukemia types (B = 85%; M = 10%; T = 5%), were similar to other parts of the country. At the end of the 5-year treatment, 20% of the patients were alive, 53% had died and 27% had abandoned the treatment. Global survival was 42% (B = 45%; T = 20%; M = 10%) (median: 38.8 months; confidence interval of 95% = 28.9-48.7). Very high-risk median survival was 7.7 versus 47 months. There was no difference between standard and high-risk groups. The initial leukocyte count < 50,000/mL and CD10 positive were related to better B survival; no other variables were related. At the time of death, 29% of patients were in remission. Conclusions: Global survival of acute leukemia at Hospital de Especialidades Pediatricas under the Seguro Popular during its first 5 years was surprisingly poor given the medical resources available through the insurance. Early mortality, death during remission and high desertion rates contributed to these results. A detailed revision of treatment protocols and reasons for abandoning treatment is mandatory.","['Departamento de Investigacion.

INTERVENTIONS: The patient received hyper-Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine,Adriamycin, Dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) regimen chemotherapy (methotrexate, pirarubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine) for 3 courses of chemotherapy. After 3 months of treatment, the patient developed intermittent pain, blurred vision, and inarticulate speech. Therefore, the patient was considered as central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) and immediately received 2 courses of chemotherapy with hyper-CVAD-B combined with polyethylene glycol conjugated asparaginase (PEG-ASP). OUTCOMES: On the seventh day after the completion of chemotherapy, the patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis because he complained of perianal pain and hematuria, and his creatine kinase (CK) increased suddenly to 3136 U/L. Finally, the patient died despite all kinds of active rescue. LESSONS: Rhabdomyolysis may occur after chemotherapy of leukemia. When patients developed hematuria, muscle weakness, or even asymptomatic elevation of CK levels, physicians should pay attention to the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis and take active hydration treatment.","['Hematology Department, First Affliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.']",,,,,,,PMC6250547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall survival (OS) superiority has not been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (RCT) in this population, challenging the value of available therapies. We sought to assess the relative value of approved therapies using value-assessment tools. Clinical, safety, quality-of-life (QOL), supportive care, and resource utilization outcomes data were abstracted from RCTs and examined using value-assessment frameworks. Three RCTs, one each of azacitidine, decitabine, and low-dose cytarabine were identified. OS was not statistically significant and secondary outcomes including response rates, rates of transfusion independence, the frequency of hospitalizations and changes in QOL were reported differently across trials. Value-assessment tools considered OS as the primary efficacy endpoint without consideration to response rates. The NCCN Evidence Blocks(TM) were most successful in considering secondary endpoints. With the move toward value-based care, understanding how these value tools apply to AML patients is critical.","['a Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions, Cardinal Health , Dublin , OH , USA.', 'b Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization , Princeton , NJ , USA.', 'a Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions, Cardinal Health , Dublin , OH , USA.']",,20181108,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 May;60(5):1107-1109.

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"The specific prognostic factors and the long-term effects of different treatment options in APL remain unclear. In this retrospective study, 70 APL patients were treated with ATRA + DNR/DA or ATRA + ATO regimens for induction therapy and DA or ATRA + ATO for consolidation and maintenance therapy. The prognostic factors and treatment effects on outcome were analyzed. Results showed that the 5-year OS in low-intermediate risk and high risk groups were 95.63% and 100%, and the 5-year RFS were 95.34% and 100%, respectively, the early mortality rate was 4.28%. No significant difference was found on OS and RFS with different regimens, but side-effects and treatment-related mortality rates were lower in ATRA + ATO group. CD34 expression, FLT3-ITD mutation and PML-RARA isoform had no significance on OS and RFS. In conclusion, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities had no influence on effect of APL patients; ATRA + ATO sequential maintenance may alleviate complications, treatment-related mortality, and the previously high risk factors.","[""a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University , Huai'an , P.

Patients and methods We report a case of intracranial Ewing sarcoma in a 13-year-old girl who complained of headache and migraine. The tumor had developed in the right middle cranial fossa with a mass effect on the brain with impending transuncal herniation. RESULTS: Undifferentiated small round cell morphology with completely negative results for friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (Fli-1) and a nonspecific cytoplasmic CD99-positive staining pattern mislead the diagnosis as central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumor, NOS. However, whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed Ewing sarcoma (EWS)-Fli-1 gene fusion, which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization study and the diagnosis was revised to ES. CONCLUSIONS: This case is a true intracranial but extra-axial ES confirmed by WGS. We report this case of intracranial ES to demonstrate the importance of marker gene studies using FISH or NGS.","['Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 103 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Seoul National University Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 103 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 103 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea. shparknp@snu.ac.kr.', ""Seoul National University Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. shparknp@snu.ac.kr."", ""Institute of Neuroscience, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. shparknp@snu.ac.kr.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8681-1597'],20181107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"Micro-environment plays important role in the pathogenesis of CLL by providing protective niche for CLL cells. Several molecules play important role in communication between CLL cells and immune cells like CD86.Some of the data suggest that CLL patients with high CD86 level need earlier treatments and cells with higher CD86 expression has higher proliferation rate but the role of CD86 in the survival and proliferation of CLL cells is unclear. We investigated the effect of CD86 expression to CLL cells in 50 peripheral blood and 15 lymph node biopsy samples from CLL patients. Our results showed that the expressions of CD86 increased significantly after 7 day culturing in medium, or in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). We found positive correlation between CD86 and CD23 expression (p < 0.05), but no correlation with other markers. Furthermore, no correlation were found between the CD86 expression and the proliferation of CLL cells. Analysis of clinical data showed that cases with high CD86 expression had lower level of serum lymphocyte count (p < 0.04) at the time of the diagnosis. CD86 shows multiple appearances in the lymph nodes containing pseudofollicules, but no correlation was found between CD86 positivity, and Ki67 positivity. Our results suggest that the use of CD86 molecule as a proliferation marker for CLL is highly questionable. However, the CD86 molecule may interfere with the immune system of patients with CLL by activating and depleting immune functions. That can be the reason why CD86 positivity may mean worse prognosis.","['1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 26, Budapest, H-1085, Hungary. barna.gabor@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.']",,20181108,,,"['NVKP_16-1-2016-0004/Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation', 'Office (NFKIH)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 7.,"Despite significant advances in the treatment of complications requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU mortality remains high for patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We evaluated the role of thrombocytopenia and poor graft function in allogeneic stem cell recipients receiving ICU treatments along with established prognostic ICU markers in order to identify patients at risk for severe complications. At ICU admission, clinical and laboratory data of 108 allogeneic stem cell transplanted ICU patients were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Platelet counts (</= 50,000/mul, p < 0.0005), hemoglobin levels (</= 8.5 mg/dl, p = 0.019), and leukocyte count (</= 1500/mul, p = 0.025) along with sepsis (p = 0.002) and acute myeloid leukemia (p < 0.0005) correlated significantly with survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed thrombocytopenia (hazard ratio (HR) 2.79 (1.58-4.92, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and anemia (HR 1.82, 1.06-3.11, 95% CI) as independent mortality risk factors. Predominant ICU diagnoses were acute respiratory failure (75%), acute kidney injury (47%), and septic shock (30%). Acute graft versus host disease was diagnosed in 42% of patients, and 47% required vasopressors. Low platelet (</= 50,000/mul) and poor graft function are independent prognostic factors for impaired survival in critically ill stem cell transplanted patients. The underlying pathophysiology of poor graft function is not fully understood and currently under investigation. High-risk patients may be identified and ICU treatments stratified according to allogeneic stem cell patients' individual risk profiles. In contrast to previous studies involving medical or surgical ICU patients, the fraction of thrombocytopenic patients was larger and low platelets were a better differentiating factor in multivariate analysis than any other parameter.","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany. amin.turki@uk-essen.de.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1347-3360'],20181107,,['Ann Hematol. 2018 Dec 14;:.

The dynamics of these proteins' expression and interactions determine the survival of all cells in an organism, whether the healthy cells of a fully competent immune system or the diseased cells of an individual with cancer. Anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 are well-known for maintaining tumor cell survival and are therefore attractive drug targets. The BCL-2-selective inhibitor venetoclax has been approved for use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is now being studied in a number of other hematologic malignancies.

The diagnosis of MM was based on the presence of serum M-protein, abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, and lytic bone lesions. The patient achieved a partial response to lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment. However, 2 years after the diagnosis of MM, the patient developed leukocytosis with granulocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow examination revealed Philadelphia chromosomes and chimeric p190 BCR-ABL mRNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization also revealed BCR-ABL-positive neutrophils in the peripheral blood, which suggested the emergence of CML with p190 BCR-ABL. The codevelopment of MM and CML is very rare, and this is the first report describing p190 BCR-ABL-type CML coexisting with MM.

Recently, the role of vitamin D (VD) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms in hematologic malignancies has been considered. In this review, we examine the possible role of VD levels, as well as VDR polymorphisms as prognostic biomarkers in leukemia/lymphoma. Relevant English language literature were searched and retrieved from Google Scholar search engine (1985-2017). The following keywords were used: vitamin D, vitamin D receptor, leukemia, lymphoma, and polymorphism. Increased serum levels of VD in patients with leukemia are associated with a better prognosis. However, low VD levels are associated with a poor prognosis, and VDR polymorphisms in various leukemias can have prognostic value. VD biomarker can be regarded as a potential prognostic factor for a number of leukemias, including acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There is a significant relationship between different polymorphisms of VDR (including Taq I and Fok I) with several leukemia types such as ALL and AML, which may have prognostic value.","['Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.']",,20181008,,,,,PMC6199555,['Conflict of interest: the authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, development of resistance and high rates of relapse is a significant impediment in successfully treating AML. We performed a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and identified 113 (83 after adjusting for Linkage Disequilibrium) SNPs associated with in vitro cytarabine chemosensitivity of diagnostic leukemic cells from a cohort of 50 pediatric AML patients (p<10(-4)). Further evaluation of diagnostic leukemic cell gene-expression identified 19 SNP-gene pairs with a concordant triad of associations: i)SNP genotype with cytarabine sensitivity (p<0.0001), ii) gene-expression with cytarabine sensitivity (p<0.05), and iii) genotype with gene-expression (p<0.1). Two genes from SNP-gene pairs, rs1376041-GPR56 and rs75400242-IGF1R, were functionally validated by siRNA knockdown in AML cell lines. Consistent with association of rs1376041 and gene-expression in AML patients siRNA mediated knock-down of GPR56 increased cytarabine sensitivity of AML cell lines. Similarly for IGF1R, knockdown increased the cytarabine sensitivity of AML cell lines consistent with results in AML patients. Given both IGF1R and GPR56 are promising drug-targets in AML, our results on SNPs driving the expression/function of these genes will not only enhance our understanding of cytarabine resistance but also hold promise in personalizing AML for targeted therapies.","['Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research and Center for Pharmacogenomics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research and Center for Pharmacogenomics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Acute and Tertiary Care, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research and Center for Pharmacogenomics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",,20181009,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6201857,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) regulates multiple cell signal pathways in a variety of cellular functions, including cell migration, proliferation, survival and angiogenesis. SDF-1-induced chemotaxis is an important step of lymphocyte migration. However, the molecular mechanisms that modulate SDF-1-mediated lymphocyte migration are not well identified. Nitric oxide (NO) has been found to function as a signaling molecule in a number of signaling pathways, including migration. In the present study, the potential role of NO in SDF-1-induced migration and the association between NO and the cytoskeletal changes of Jurkat cells was investigated. The present study demonstrated that Jurkat cells induced the production of NO by SDF-1 stimulation, using Griess reaction method and western blot analysis, and that NO was involved in SDF-1-induced rearrangement and polymerization of the cytoskeleton, using NOS inhibitor L-NMMA. Furthermore, NO was required for the migration of Jurkat cells. The research suggested that NO signaling pathways exerted a critical role in SDF-1-induced cytoskeleton changes and the migration of Jurkat cells. This work provides insight into the migration mechanism of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and provides an effective theoretical basis for therapy strategies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Department of Biology, School of Life Science, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030006, P.R.

The literature review revealed that myeloid leukemia may appear secondary to Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, simultaneous bi-lineage hematologic malignancies are rarely seen and the prognosis is worse than single lineage lymphoma or myeloid leukemia. There were no standard therapies. All simultaneous bi-lineage malignancies of myeloid leukemia and lymphoma reported in Pubmed were combined with the present two cases, to analyses its pathogenesis, features and treatment. It was concluded that the prognosis of bi-lineage hematologic malignancies was poor, however allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could improve survival (P=0.033).","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450002, P.R.

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"Breast cancer is a common malignant tumor among females, with triple-negative breast cancer being an important type accounting for 15-20% of all breast cancer cases. Triple-negative breast cancer is one of the most aggressive types of cancer without standard adjuvant chemotherapy. Ganoderic acid A (GA-A) is one of the major bioactive Ganoderma triterpenoids isolated from Ganoderma, which are recognized for their preventative and therapeutic effects. In the present study, the antineoplastic effect of GA-A on human breast cancer was investigated and the pro-apoptotic function of Janus kinase (JAK)2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 on the function of GA-A was revealed. GA-A treatment inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, GA-A exhibited significant antitumor activity by enhancing the apoptotic index and reactive oxygen species production. In the present study, GA-A was identified to directly inhibit JAK2 phosphorylation and STAT3 downstream activation. In addition, GA-A suppressed STAT3 target gene expression, including B cell lymphoma-extra-large and Myeloid cell leukemia 1, resulting in elevated levels of proteins associated with mitochondrial apoptosis in addition to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase. GA-A, in combination with AG490, a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, further decreased MDA-MB-231 cell viability. In conclusion, GA-A treatment inhibited breast cancer cell viability via JAK2/STAT3 downregulation and may regulate associated targets to serve an anti-MDA-MB-231 role, including mitochondrial apoptosis and regulating the expression of cell-cycle-associated factors.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150081, P.R.

However, despite the impressive results in patients with hematologic malignancies, CAR-T cells have showed limited effect against solid cancers. New approaches will need to simultaneously overcome the multiple challenges that CAR-T cells encounter in solid tumors, including the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity of antigen expression. Oncolytic viruses are lytic and immunogenic anti-cancer agents with the potential to synergize with CAR-T cells for the treatment of solid tumors. In addition, viruses can be further modified to deliver therapeutic transgenes selectively to the tumor microenvironment, which could enhance the effector functions of tumor-specific T cells. This review summarizes the major limitations of CAR-T cells in solid tumors and discusses the potential role for oncolytic viruses as partners for CAR-T cells in the fight against cancer.","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain."", ""ProCure Program, IDIBELL-Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain.""]",,20181023,,,,,PMC6207052,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, TKI are not curative because of the development of resistance and lack of complete molecular remission in the majority of patients. Clinical evidences would support the notion that patient's immune system may play a key role in preventing relapses. In particular, increased proportions of terminally differentiated CD56(+)CD16(+)CD57(+) NK cells have been reported to be associated with successful Imatinib therapy discontinuation or with a deep molecular response in Dasatinib-treated patients. In view of the potential role of NK cells in immune-response against CML, it is important to study whether any TKI have an effect on the NK cell development and identify possible molecular mechanism(s) by which continuous exposure to in vitro TKI may influence NK cell development and repertoire. To this end, CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were cultured in the absence or in the presence of Imatinib, Nilotinib, or Dasatinib. We show that all compounds exert an inhibitory effect on CD56(+) cell recovery. In addition, Dasatinib sharply skewed the repertoire of CD56(+) cell population, leading to an impaired recovery of CD56(+)CD117(-)CD16(+)CD94/NKG2A(+)EOMES(+) mature cytotoxic NK cells, while the recovery of CD56(+)CD117(+)CD94/NKG2A(-)RORgammat(+) IL-22-producing ILC3 was not affected. This effect appears to involve the Dasatinib-mediated inhibition of Src kinases and, indirectly, of STAT5-signaling activation in CD34(+) cells during first days of culture. Our studies, reveal a possible mechanism by which Dasatinib may interfere with the proliferation and maturation of fully competent NK cells, i.e., by targeting signaling pathways required for differentiation and survival of NK cells but not of ILC3.","['Dipartimento Medicina Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS G.

The graft-vs.-leukemia effect (GVL) is one of the main therapeutic goals that arises from HSCT. On the other hand, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) is still one of the main and most serious complications following allogeneic HSCT. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HSCT together with high-dose chemotherapy is used as a treatment option. An aggressive progression of the disease, a decreased response to treatment, and a poor prognosis are connected to internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene, which affects around 30% of AML patients. In this study, C3H/HeN mice received an allogeneic graft together with 32D-FLT3(ITD) AML cells to induce acute GVHD and GVL. It was examined if pre-incubation of the graft with the anti-human cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 antibody MAX.16H5 IgG1 prevented the development of GVHD and whether the graft function was impaired. Animals receiving grafts pre-incubated with the antibody together with FLT3(ITD) AML cells survived significantly longer than mice receiving untreated grafts. The observed prolonged survival due to MAX.16H5 incubation of immune cell grafts prior to transplantation may allow an extended application of additional targeted strategies in the treatment of AML.","['Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Immunology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, Halle University Hospital, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance, Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.']",,20181022,,,,,PMC6204383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing understanding of natural killer (NK) cell immunobiology has aroused considerable interest around the role of NK cells in pulmonary aspergillosis in the immunocompromised host. Murine studies indicate that NK cells play a critical role in pulmonary clearance of A. fumigatus. We show that the in vitro interaction between NK cells and A. fumigatus induces partial activation of NK cell immune response, characterised by low-level production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, polarisation of lytic granules and release of fungal DNA. We observed a contact-dependent down-regulation of activatory receptors NKG2D and NKp46 on the NK cell surface, and a failure of full granule release. Furthermore, the NK cell cytokine-mediated response to leukaemic cells was impaired in the presence of A. fumigatus. These observations suggest that A. fumigatus-mediated NK cell immunoparesis may represent an important mechanism of immune evasion during pulmonary aspergillosis.","['Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Kennedy Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Centre for Immunology and Vaccinology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung Institute, London, United Kingdom.']",,20181022,,,"['G0902260/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'NIHR-RP-011-053/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",,PMC6204393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consolidation therapy in ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 90 protocol involves the use of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX, 5 g/m(2)) over 24 h as continuous infusion. The adverse effects due to HDMTX include renal dysfunction in 2%-12% patients, which can lead to increased systemic MTX exposure, leading to further myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, skin toxicity, and, in severe cases, multiorgan failure. Dermatologic toxicity due to MTX includes morbilliform drug rash, photoreactivation, photoenhancement, and skin hyperpigmentation. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare and possibly fatal reaction which can occur with MTX. Here, we describe a patient with B-cell ALL who developed TEN after administration of HDMTX.","['Department of Medical and Paediatric Oncology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Medical and Paediatric Oncology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Medical and Paediatric Oncology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.']",,,,,,,PMC6201642,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 7.,"Although diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells widely express the BCL2 protein, they rarely respond to treatment with BCL2-selective inhibitors. Here we show that DLBCL cells harboring PMAIP1/NOXA gene amplification were highly sensitive to BCL2 small-molecule inhibitors. In these cells, BCL2 inhibition induced cell death by activating caspase 9, which was further amplified by caspase-dependent cleavage and depletion of MCL1. In DLBCL cells lacking NOXA amplification, BCL2 inhibition was associated with an increase in MCL1 protein abundance in a BIM-dependent manner, causing a decreased antilymphoma efficacy. In these cells, dual inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 was required for enhanced killing. Pharmacologic induction of NOXA, using the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat, decreased MCL1 protein abundance and increased lymphoma cell vulnerability to BCL2 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for combination strategies to disrupt lymphoma cell codependency on BCL2 and MCL1 proteins in DLBCL.","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Antitumor Assessment Core, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Core, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065; younesa@mskcc.org.', 'Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0355-3757'],20181107,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 OD020355/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA192937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6255185,"['Conflict of interest statement: A.Y. has potential conflicts of interest; funds', 'for research came from Servier and for clinical trials from Servier and Novartis.']",['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

Epub 2018 Nov 7.,"The heterogeneity of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) has made evaluating patient response to treatment challenging. In 2006, the International Working Group (IWG) proposed a revision to previously published standardized response criteria (IWG 2000) for uniformly evaluating clinical responses in MDSs. These IWG 2006 criteria have been used prospectively in many clinical trials in MDSs, but proved challenging in several of them, especially for the evaluation of erythroid response. In this report, we provide rationale for modifications (IWG 2018) of these recommendations, mainly for ""hematological improvement"" criteria used for lower-risk MDSs, based on recent practical and reported experience in clinical trials. Most suggestions relate to erythroid response assessment, which are refined in an overall more stringent manner. Two major proposed changes are the differentiation between ""procedures"" and ""criteria"" for hematologic improvement-erythroid assessment and a new categorization of transfusion-burden subgroups.","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, and Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, and Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Onkologie, Hamatologie und Palliativmedizin, Marien Hospital, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria (AOU) Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""St. James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Nijmegen Center for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Universitatsklinik Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology and Oncology), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Haematology Oncology, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Leukemia Program, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; and.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'European Myelodysplastic Syndromes Cooperative Group (EMSCO Group), Leipzig, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5130-9284'],20181107,,,,,PMC7042664,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 7.,"The tendency of mitochondria to undergo or resist BCL2-controlled apoptosis (so-called mitochondrial priming) is a powerful predictor of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Fully exploiting this finding will require unraveling the molecular genetics underlying phenotypic variability in mitochondrial priming. Here, we report that mitochondrial apoptosis resistance in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is mediated by inactivation of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). In T-ALL clinical specimens, loss-of-function mutations of PRC2 core components (EZH2, EED, or SUZ12) were associated with mitochondrial apoptosis resistance. In T-ALL cells, PRC2 depletion induced resistance to apoptosis induction by multiple chemotherapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action. PRC2 loss induced apoptosis resistance via transcriptional up-regulation of the LIM domain transcription factor CRIP2 and downstream up-regulation of the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1 These findings demonstrate the importance of mitochondrial apoptotic priming as a prognostic factor in T-ALL and implicate mitochondrial chaperone function as a molecular determinant of chemotherapy response.","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Deparment of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."", ""Cancer and Blood Disorders Department, Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Carilion Children's, Roanoke, VA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA alejandro.gutierrez@childrens.harvard.edu."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5387-9069', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6530-7829', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7036-1053', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8182-659X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2566-3145', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4081-8195', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6631-5174', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9063-7205', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3523-7687', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0249-9007']",20181107,,,"['K08 CA191091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6279404,,['(c) 2018 Aries et al.'],"['RefSeq/NM_003797', 'RefSeq/NM_004456']",,,,,,,,,,,

Aged HSCs show changes to their epigenome, such as alterations in DNA methylation and histone methylation and acetylation landscapes. We previously showed a correlation between high Cdc42 activity in aged HSCs and the loss of intranuclear epigenetic polarity, or epipolarity, as indicated by the specific distribution of H4K16ac. RESULTS: Here, we show that not all histone modifications display a polar localization and that a reduction in H4K16ac amount and loss of epipolarity are specific to aged HSCs. Increasing the levels of H4K16ac is not sufficient to restore polarity in aged HSCs and the restoration of HSC function. The changes in H4K16ac upon aging and rejuvenation of HSCs are correlated with a change in chromosome 11 architecture and alterations in nuclear volume and shape. Surprisingly, by taking advantage of knockout mouse models, we demonstrate that increased Cdc42 activity levels correlate with the repression of the nuclear envelope protein LaminA/C, which controls chromosome 11 distribution, H4K16ac polarity, and nuclear volume and shape in aged HSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data show that chromatin architecture changes in aged stem cells are reversible by decreasing the levels of Cdc42 activity, revealing an unanticipated way to pharmacologically target LaminA/C expression and revert alterations of the epigenetic architecture in aged HSCs.","['Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Kollegiengasse 10, 07743, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Grosshaderner Strasse 2, 82152, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany.', 'Department of Biology II and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Grosshaderner Strasse 2, 82152, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center Ulm, University Hospital Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Regulation of Cellular Differentiation Group, INF280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), INF280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), INF280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center Ulm, University Hospital Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Aging, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11c, 89081, Ulm, Germany. carolina.florian@uni-ulm.de.', ""Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de l'Hospitalet, 199-203, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908, Barcelona, Spain. carolina.florian@uni-ulm.de.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5791-1310'],20181107,,,"['R01 AG040118/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK104814/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6223039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarize here the results of published studies investigating the clinical application of minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) in patients with NPM1-mutated AML, receiving either intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Several clinical trials have so far demonstrated a significant independent prognostic impact of molecular MRD monitoring in NPM1-mutated AML and, accordingly, the Consensus Document from the European Leukemia Net MRD Working Party has recently recommended that NPM1-mutated AML patients have MRD assessment at informative clinical timepoints during treatment and follow-up. However, several controversies remain, mainly with regard to the most clinically significant timepoints and the MRD thresholds to be considered, but also with respect to the optimal source to be analyzed, namely bone marrow or peripheral blood samples, and the correlation of MRD with other known prognostic indicators. Moreover, we discuss potential advantages, as well as drawbacks, of newer molecular technologies such as digital droplet PCR and next-generation sequencing in comparison to conventional RQ-PCR to quantify NPM1-mutated MRD. In conclusion, further prospective clinical trials are warranted to standardize MRD monitoring strategies and to optimize MRD-guided therapeutic interventions in NPM1-mutated AML patients.","['Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Modena, Via del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy. fabio.forghieri@unimore.it.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo, Viale Golgi 19, 27100 Pavia, Italy. pcomoli@smatteo.pv.it.', 'Cell Factory, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo, Viale Golgi 19, 27100 Pavia, Italy. pcomoli@smatteo.pv.it.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Modena, Via del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy. roberto.marasca@unimore.it.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Modena, Via del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy. leonardo.potenza@unimore.it.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Modena, Via del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy. mario.luppi@unimore.it.']",,20181106,,,,,PMC6274702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 4.,"AIMS AND METHODS: Many antiviral agents have been reported to present direct cytotoxic activity in cancer, showing antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects through different mechanisms. In the present study, we took into account the cytotoxic action of the antiviral drug acyclovir (ACV) on leukemia cells, by investigating cell cycle perturbations and apoptosis induction upon drug administration to three still unexplored cell lines, namely Jurkat, U937, and K562. At the same time, the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (CDDP) and 5fluorouracil (5FU) in combination with ACV was assessed, thus to evaluate if the antiviral agent could enhance cancer cell sensitivity to these chemotherapeutic drugs. FINDINGS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results showed that ACV cytotoxic action was maximum in Jurkat cells (acute T cell leukemia), which showed a dose- and time-dependent reduction of cell viability after drug exposure. The flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle revealed a delay/block in S phase and an increase of the sub-G1 peak upon ACV administration, thereby indicating apoptotic cell death. The activation of caspase-3 and the presence of nuclear DNA fragmentation confirmed the induction of apoptosis in ACV-treated cells. Interestingly, the pre-treatment of Jurkat cells with ACV for 72h or 7days increased CDDP and 5-FU cytotoxicity, suggesting enhanced leukemia cell sensitivity to these anticancer drugs.","['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino ""Carlo Bo"", Urbino, Italy.

Epub 2018 Nov 7.,"PURPOSE: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) occurs in the blood of approximately 20% of older persons. CHIP is linked to an increased risk of hematologic malignancies and of all-cause mortality; thus, the eligibility of stem-cell donors with CHIP is questionable. We comprehensively investigated how donor CHIP affects outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: We collected blood samples from 500 healthy, related HSCT donors (age >/= 55 years) at the time of stem-cell donation for targeted sequencing with a 66-gene panel. The effect of donor CHIP was assessed on recipient outcomes, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cumulative incidence of relapse/progression (CIR/P), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 92 clonal mutations with a median variant allele frequency of 5.9% were identified in 80 (16.0%) of 500 donors. CHIP prevalence was higher in donors related to patients with myeloid compared with lymphoid malignancies (19.2% v 6.3%; P </= .001). In recipients allografted with donor CHIP, we found a high cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD; hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.49; P = .003) and lower CIR/P (univariate: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.97; P = .027; multivariate: HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.98; P = .042) but no effect on nonrelapse mortality. Serial quantification of 25 mutations showed engraftment of 24 of 25 clones and disproportionate expansion in half of them. Donor-cell leukemia was observed in two recipients. OS was not affected by donor CHIP status (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.321; P = .434). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic HSCT from donors with CHIP seems safe and results in similar survival in the setting of older, related donors. Future studies in younger and unrelated donors are warranted to extend these results. Confirmatory studies and mechanistic experiments are warranted to challenge the hypothesis that donor CHIP might foster cGVHD development and reduce relapse/progression risk.","['1 Charite - University Medical Center Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', '1 Charite -

Epub 2018 Nov 7.,"Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid present in several plants, possesses a wide range of therapeutic properties such as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory. It has a significant role in reducing cancer and can act as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of diseases and ailments such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, oxidative stress, asthma, and microbial contamination disorders. Kaempferol acts through different mechanisms: It induces apoptosis (HeLa cervical cancer cells), decreases cell viability (G2/M phase), downregulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (protein kinase B) and human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus-I (HTLV-I) signaling pathways, suppresses protein expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers including N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Slug, and Snail, and metastasis-related markers such as matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2). Accordingly, the aim of the present review is to collect information pertaining to the effective role of kaempferol against various degenerative disorders, summarize the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antiaging effects of kaempferol and to review the progress of recent research and available data on kaempferol as a protective and chemotherapeutic agent against several ailments.","['University Institute of Diet & Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Allied and Health Sciences, The University of Lahore-Pakistan.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Swabi Anbar, Swabi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Swabi Anbar, Swabi, Pakistan.', 'Faculty of Home and Food Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan.', 'Faculty of Home and Food Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan.', 'Faculty of Home and Food Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan.', 'Center of Biotechnology and Microbiology, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Department of EMS.

Although the efficacy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children was significantly increased with the adjustment of chemotherapy regimen, there were still a few patients who failed in treatment. The main reasons were relapse and drug resistance. Minimal residual disease (MRD) refers to a state in which there remain traces of leukemia cells that could not be detected using morphological methods in leukemia patients who are in complete remission after receiving the induction chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, which is considered to be the main cause of recurrence. The most commonly used methods for detection of MRD include flow cytometry (FCM), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). MRD evaluation plays an important role in evaluating prognosis, predicting recurrence, guiding risk stratify and individualized therapy for children with ALL. In this paper, we reviewed the progresses in major detection methods for MRD that have been made in the clinical application of pediatric ALL.","[""Pediatric Department, PI Research Unit of Children's Blood and Tumor, the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China. liuwenjun200@gmail.com.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MiR-126 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. This study explores the regulatory role of miR-126 in myeloma and related molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MiR-126 and control were synthesized and transfected to myeloma cell line Karpas707 using Lipofectamine. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by MTT assay, caspase-3 activity detection, and flow cytometry. Myeloid cell leukemin (MCL) siRNA and plasmid were transfected to Karpas707 cells to test its impact on cell apoptosis. RESULTS: MTT assay revealed that miR-126 significantly restrained Karpas707 cell growth (p=0.0017). Cell apoptosis detection showed that miR-126 significantly promoted phosphatidylserine eversion and caspase-3 activation (p=0.031), and downregulated MCL level (p=0.017). MCL siRNA markedly enhanced Karpas707 cell apoptosis induced by miR-126 (p=0.024), while the MCL overexpression apparently inhibited Karpas707 cell apoptosis induced by miR-126 (p=0.0073). CONCLUSIONS: MiR-126 induces Karpas707 cell apoptosis by downregulating anti-apoptotic protein MCL, which provides a theoretical basis for the target selection of myeloma.","['Department of Orthopaedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China. pocheliaolunbu@163.com.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 5.,"Background: The complication rate of fungal disease is higher among patients with hematological malignancies. We investigated the clinicobacteriological outcomes of resected pulmonary fungal infections complicating hematological malignancies. Methods: Between 2001 and 2017, 21 patients with pulmonary fungal infections complicating hematological malignancies underwent resection, and their clinical records and survival were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The median age of the patients was 47 years, and 13 were male. The histological diagnoses were pulmonary aspergillosis (19 cases), mucormycosis (1 case), and cryptococcosis (1 case). The indications for surgery were resistance to antifungal therapy and the necessity of surgery before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 13 and 8 cases, respectively. The diagnoses of the hematological malignancies were acute myelogenous leukemia (10 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (5 cases), myelodysplastic syndrome (3 cases), and chronic myelogenous leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and extramedullary plasmacytoma (1 case each). The surgical procedures were partial resection (11 cases), segmentectomy (5 cases), lobectomy (4 cases), and cavernostomy (1 case). The size of the lesions was 0.9-8.5 cm. Fourteen cases had cavitation. There were no surgical-related deaths or fungal progression. Conclusion: Pulmonary fungal infections are resistant to treatments for hematological malignancies. Since the treatment of the underlying disease is extended and these infections often recur and are exacerbated, surgery should be considered when possible.","['Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital.']",,20181005,,,,,PMC6200165,"['Conflict of interest No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article', 'was reported.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 17.,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an infrequent autosomal recessive disorder that involves multiple systems and is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, radiosensitivity, immune deficiency with recurrent respiratory infections, and a tendency to develop lymphoid malignancies. A-T is caused by mutations in the ATM gene, with >1,000 mutations reported to date and gradually increasing in number. Patients with A-T have an increased incidence of cancers. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively review the case of a patient who presented at the age of 5 years with cerebellar ataxia without telangiectasia, and was diagnosed with Burkitt leukemia by bone marrow biopsy and molecular testing at the age of 7 years at the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China). The patient received chemotherapy with the pediatric CCCG-BNHL-2015 regimen (R4 group) and achieved a complete remission after 2 courses. However, recurrent respiratory infections and thrombosis occurred during chemotherapy. The diagnosis of A-T was confirmed by uncovering two variants of the ATM gene, including c.742C>T (p.R248X; rs730881336) in exon 7 and c.6067-c.6068 ins GAGGGAAGAT in exon 41 by whole-exome sequencing. Unfortunately, the patient's parents refused follow-up treatment and he succumbed to recurrent severe infections 4 months after the diagnosis of Burkitt leukemia. The diagnosis of A-T may be challenging, as its phenotype can be incomplete early in the course of the disease. Detailed medical history, characteristic clinical manifestations and increasingly developed exome sequencing techniques may be helpful in diagnosing this rare disease. Management should be based on multidisciplinary guidance and other treatment options must be investigated in the future.","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, P.R.

From seven large medical centers, we identified ten patients with t(8;9)(p22;p24) /PCM1-JAK2 and 3 with t(9p24;v)/JAK2 at diagnosis. Majority of the cases showed myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) associated features (n = 7) characterized by variable degrees of eosinophilia, myelofibrosis, frequent proliferations of early erythroblasts in bone marrow and extramedullary sites, and infrequent/absent somatic mutations. Other less common presentations included myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or MDS/MPN (one each). Four patients presented with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and of them, two patients with t(8;9)(p22;p24.1) were proven to be B-lymphoblastic crisis of MPN; and the other two cases with t(9p24;v) both were de novo B-ALL, BCR-ABL1-like (Ph-like). We show that the hematopoietic neoplasms with 9p24/JAK2 rearrangement are extremely rare, and most of them are associated with t(8;9)(p22;p24)/PCM1-JAK2, a recent provisional World Health Organization entity under ""myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with a specific gene rearrangement"". Cases of t(8;9)(p22;p24)/PCM1-JAK2, though heterogeneous, do exhibit some common clinicopathological characteristic features. Cases with t(9p24;v)/JAK2 are extremely rare; while such cases with a MPN presentation may resemble t(8;9)(p22;p24.1)/PCM1-JAK2, B-ALL cases presenting de novo B-ALL might belong to Ph-like B-ALL.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Boston Children Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

To unravel the potential of TMD crystals in biomedicine, control over their production through green and scalable routes in biocompatible solvents is critically important. Furthermore, considering multiple applications of eco-friendly 2D dispersions and their potential impact onto live matter, their toxicity and antimicrobial activity still remain an open issue. Herein, we focus on the current demands of 2D TMDs and produce high-quality, few-layered and defect-free MoS2 nanosheets, exfoliated and dispersed in pure water, stabilized up to three weeks. Hence, we studied the impact of this material on human cells by investigating its interactions with three cell lines: two tumoral, MCF7 (breast cancer) and U937 (leukemia), and one normal, HaCaT (epithelium). We observed novel and intriguing results, exhibiting evident cytotoxic effect induced in the tumor cell lines, absent in the normal cells in the tested conditions. The antibacterial action of MoS2 nanosheets is then investigated against a very dangerous gram negative bacterium, such as two types of Salmonellas: ATCC 14028 and wild-type Salmonella typhimurium. Additionally, concentration and layer-dependent modulation of cytotoxic effect is found both on human cells and Salmonellas.","['Department of Physics, ""Ettore Pancini"", University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Physics, ""Ettore Pancini"", University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""L Vanvitelli, Vico L.

Despite large-scale studies of the transcriptome in cancer, a comprehensive look at TE expression and its relationship to various mutations or prognosis has not been performed. We characterized the expression of TE in 178 adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients using transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We characterized mutation specific dysregulation of TE expression using a multivariate linear model. We identified distinct patterns of TE expression associated with specific mutations and transcriptional networks. Genes regulating methylation was not associated with significant change in TE expression. Using an unpenalized cox regression analysis we identified a TE expression signature that predicted prognosis in AML. We identified 14 candidate prognostic TE transcripts (TEP) that classified AML as high/low-risk and this was independent of mutation-based and coding-gene expression based risk-stratification. TEP was able to predict prognosis in independent cohorts of 284 pediatric AML patients and 19 relapsed adult AML patients. This first comprehensive study of TE expression in AML demonstrates that TE expression can serve as a biomarker for prognosis in AML, and provides novel insights into the biology of AML. Studies characterizing its role in other cancers are warranted.","['Jane Anne Nohl Division of Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90033, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Van Andel Research Institute, 333 Bostwick Ave NE, Grand Rapids, MI, 49503, USA. tim.triche@vai.org.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90033, USA. giriramsingh@gmail.com.']",,20181106,,,,,PMC6219593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 6.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an age-related disease that is highly dependent on the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. With increasing age, tissues accumulate senescent cells, characterized by an irreversible arrest of cell proliferation and the secretion of a set of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here, we report that AML blasts induce a senescent phenotype in the stromal cells within the BM microenvironment and that the BM stromal cell senescence is driven by p16INK4a expression. The p16INK4a-expressing senescent stromal cells then feed back to promote AML blast survival and proliferation via the SASP. Importantly, selective elimination of p16INK4a(+) senescent BM stromal cells in vivo improved the survival of mice with leukemia. Next, we find that the leukemia-driven senescent tumor microenvironment is caused by AML-induced NOX2-derived superoxide. Finally, using the p16-3MR mouse model, we show that by targeting NOX2 we reduced BM stromal cell senescence and consequently reduced AML proliferation. Together, these data identify leukemia-generated NOX2-derived superoxide as a driver of protumoral p16INK4a-dependent senescence in BM stromal cells.

Materials and Methods: Seventy ALL survivors, who were between 7 and 17 years of age and had completed therapy >/=2 years, were included. The control group consisted of their healthy siblings. HRQL was assessed by the age-specific KINDL(R) questionnaire. Results: No significant differences could be found among HRQL scores of ALL survivors with respect to variables such as sex, risk group, and having chronic illness. HRQL scores for physical well-being, emotional well-being, family, and social functioning of the patient and sibling self-reports and parent proxy reports were lower than the expected values for healthy and chronically ill children. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that both ALL survivors and their families need help via psychological counseling programs to improve their HRQL even after completion of therapy.","['Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey', 'Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey', 'Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey', 'Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6269-187X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8765-3615', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4792-269X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3425-7360', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0721-1025', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8692-2767', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9375-2855', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7874-3734', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0686-7129', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5760-8007']",20181106,,,,,PMC6516105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with primary CBL may present with symptoms not related to leukemia. Dysplastic changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow were described and demonstrated in cases of primary and secondary CBL. The literature review also revealed that differential counts made by automated blood cell counters may not characterize cells as basophils in patients with primary and secondary CBL and may mislead physicians in making a differential diagnosis. For these reasons, laboratory studies for the diagnosis of CBL are required, including metachromatic staining by toluidine blue and antigen expressions by flow cytometric analysis, to detect the nature of the neoplastic cells as basophils for a reliable diagnosis of CBL. The literature review failed to reveal specific cytogenetic findings in patients with primary and secondary types of CBL.","['Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Izmir, Turkey']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6031-6304'],20180801,,,,,PMC6256821,,,,,,Kronik Bazofilik Losemide Tanisal Sorunlar,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 1.,"CLEC12A has recently been identified as an antigen, expressed on leukemic stem cells and leukemic blasts. Given the fact that this expression profile seems stable throughout diagnosis, treatment and relapse on leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells, CLEC12A can be considered a highly potent and reliable marker for the detection of measurable residual disease and therefore applicable for risk stratification and prognostication in AML. Low CLEC12A expression on leukemic blasts seems to be independently associated with lower likelihood of achieving complete remission after 1cycle of induction chemotherapy, shorter event free survival, as well as overall survival, indicating potential prognostic properties of CLEC12A expression itself. Lack of expression on the normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, in contrast to CD123 and CD33, might result in less toxicity regarding cytopenias, making CLEC12A an interesting target for innovating immunotherapies, including monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and CAR-T cells therapy.","['Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
