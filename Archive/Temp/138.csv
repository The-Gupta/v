Since its identification eight years ago, contradictory findings regarding its intracellular localization and molecular mode of action have been reported, which may be attributed to unpredicted differences among the human and rodent orthologs. By aligning the sequences of all available ZIPK orthologs, from fish to human, we discovered that rat and mouse sequences are more diverged from the human ortholog relative to other, more distant, vertebrates. To test experimentally the outcome of this sequence divergence, we compared rat ZIPK to human ZIPK in the same cellular settings. We found that while ectopically expressed human ZIPK localized to the cytoplasm and induced membrane blebbing, rat ZIPK localized exclusively within nuclei, mainly to promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic bodies, and induced significantly lower levels of membrane blebbing. Among the unique murine (rat and mouse) sequence features, we found that a highly conserved phosphorylation site, previously shown to have an effect on the cellular localization of human ZIPK, is absent in murines but not in earlier diverging organisms. Recreating this phosphorylation site in rat ZIPK led to a significant reduction in its promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic body localization, yet did not confer full cytoplasmic localization. Additionally, we found that while rat ZIPK interacts with PAR-4 (also known as PAWR) very efficiently, human ZIPK fails to do so. This interaction has clear functional implications, as coexpression of PAR-4 with rat ZIPK caused nuclear to cytoplasm translocation and induced strong membrane blebbing, thus providing the murine protein a possible adaptive mechanism to compensate for its sequence divergence. We have also cloned zebrafish ZIPK and found that, like the human and unlike the murine orthologs, it localizes to the cytoplasm, and fails to bind the highly conserved PAR-4 protein. This further supports the hypothesis that murine ZIPK underwent specific divergence from a conserved consensus. In conclusion, we present a case of species-specific divergence occurring in a specific branch of the evolutionary tree, accompanied by the acquisition of a unique protein-protein interaction that enables conservation of cellular function.","['Shoval, Yishay', 'Pietrokovski, Shmuel', 'Kimchi, Adi']","['Shoval Y', 'Pietrokovski S', 'Kimchi A']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070907,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Dapk3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Dapk3 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phylogeny', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Zebrafish']",2007/10/24 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-PLGE-RA-0323 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pgen.0030180 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2007 Oct;3(10):1884-93. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030180.

PF is known to cause apoptosis and to be a chemical heat shock protein (HSP) inducer. With this information, the effects on the gene expression in human leukemia U937 cells treated with PF were investigated. METHODS: U937 cells, a human myelomonocytic cell line, were treated with PF at different concentrations (0-640 microg/ml). Expression level of Hsp70 was monitored by Western blotting. Gene expression was evaluated using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and computational gene expression analysis tools and the results were verified by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Although cell viability was not affected after PF treatment at a high concentration of 640 microg/ml, PF treatment (80-640 microg/ml) significantly elevated Hsp70 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. When the cells were treated with PF (160 microg/ml; 30 min), 35 up-regulated and 29 down-regulated genes were identified. Among the differentially expressed genes, a significant genetic network containing CDC2, FOSL1 and EGR1 was associated with biological functions such as cell death, gene expression or cellular growth and proliferation. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that PF affects the expression of many genes including Hsp70 and will provide a better understanding on the molecular mechanism of action of this compound in inducing HSPs in cells.","['Salunga, Thucydides L', 'Tabuchi, Yoshiaki', 'Takasaki, Ichiro', 'Feril, Loreto B Jr', 'Zhao, Qing-Li', 'Ohtsuka, Kenzo', 'Tsuneyama, Koichi', 'Kondo, Takashi']","['Salunga TL', 'Tabuchi Y', 'Takasaki I', 'Feril LB Jr', 'Zhao QL', 'Ohtsuka K', 'Tsuneyama K', 'Kondo T']","['Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '21AIQ4EV64 (peoniflorin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Monoterpenes', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['783200751 [pii]', '10.1080/02656730701639499 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 2007 Sep;23(6):529-37. doi: 10.1080/02656730701639499.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2003 and December 2004, a total of 24 patients with HLA-identical sibling donors entered this study and received three doses of 3.33 Gy F-TBI separated by 24 h and cyclophosphamide or etoposide. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 37 months (range 29-47 months), 4 of the 24 patients (16.6%) died of TRM. Relapse occurred in 10 patients at a median of 9 months (range 2-18 months). Overall, 13 of 24 patients (54%) died. Relapse was the most common cause of death (9/13). The 2-year actuarial survival rate was 46% (+/-11%). CONCLUSION: In our experience, ASCT conditioned with F-TBI was associated with low TRM but a high early relapse rate in patients with hematological malignancies.","['Othman, Tarek Ben', 'Kochbati, Lotfi', 'Abdelkefi, Abderrahman', 'Ladeb, Saloua', 'Torjman, Lamia', 'Lakhal, Amel', 'Kammoun, Leila', 'Hentati, Dalenda', 'Besbes, Mounir', 'Abdeladhim, Abdeladhim Ben', 'Maalej, Mongi']","['Othman TB', 'Kochbati L', 'Abdelkefi A', 'Ladeb S', 'Torjman L', 'Lakhal A', 'Kammoun L', 'Hentati D', 'Besbes M', 'Abdeladhim AB', 'Maalej M']","['Centre National de Greffe de Moelle Osseuse, Rue Jebel Lakhdar, 1006, Bab Saadoun, Tunis, Tunisia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071026,Japan,Radiat Med,Radiation medicine,8412264,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects/methods']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/02/21 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11604-007-0158-y [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Med. 2007 Oct;25(8):407-10. doi: 10.1007/s11604-007-0158-y.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with malignant disease who underwent TBI followed by bone marrow transplantation were retrospectively reviewed. There were 86 patients (51 males, 35 females). Altogether, 36 patients were treated on twice-daily fractions of 2 Gy for 3 days to a total 12 Gy (group A). Another 50 patients were treated on once-daily fractions of 2.4 or 3.0 Gy for 4 or 5 days to a total 12 Gy (group B). RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 49.2%, and relapse-free survival was 44.3%. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding overall survival (P = 0.1237) or relapse-free survival (P = 0.1548). Two patients in group A had interstitial pneumonitis of grade 3 or higher severity compared with three patients in group B. There was no significant difference between patients in group A (5-year probability rate was 7.6%) and patients in group B (5-year probability rate was 13.9%) (P = 0.9519). CONCLUSION: We concluded that our once-daily TBI regimen is feasible and had the benefit of reducing the complexity of TBI.

We therefore examined the influence of hyperglycaemia and glucose-lowering treatment on nephrocarcinogenesis in rats. METHODS: Rats (n = 850), which were either spontaneously diabetic, streptozotocin-diabetic or normoglycaemic, were examined with special reference to Armanni-Ebstein lesions (AEL). RESULTS: Irrespective of the cause of diabetes, diabetic but not normoglycaemic rats developed typical glycogenotic clear-cell AEL. AEL showed strong proliferative activity, which was nearly completely inhibited by EGF receptor blockade (Gefitinib treatment). Many findings suggested a stepwise development of RCCs from AEL. Whereas the number and size of RCCs gradually increased in all diabetic groups, beginning at 6 months after onset of diabetes, normoglycaemic controls did not developed RCC. After 28 months, up to 82% of diabetic animals had at least one RCC. In contrast to the proximal tubules, the distal tubular system, including glycogenotic AEL, had the same levels of enzyme activities as RCC (e.g. high glycogen phosphorylase and synthase activity, lack of glucose 6-phosphatase activity) and the same expression patterns of cytokeratin 7 and several growth factors, along with their receptors and signal transduction proteins (TGF-alpha, EGF receptor, IGF-I, IGF-I receptor, IGF-II receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue 1 and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1). In addition, direct morphological transitions between distal tubules, AEL and RCCs were frequently observed. All these findings indicate a common origin and a precursor-product relationship of AEL and RCCs. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Nephrocarcinogenesis in diabetic rats results from sustained hyperglycaemia, resulting in an adaptive metabolic response, altered growth factor signalling and subsequent neoplastic transformation of the tubular epithelial cells.","['Dombrowski, F', 'Klotz, L', 'Bannasch, P', 'Evert, M']","['Dombrowski F', 'Klotz L', 'Bannasch P', 'Evert M']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universitat Greifswald, Friedrich-Loeffler-Strasse 23e, 17487, Greifswald, Germany. frank.dombrowski@uni-greifswald.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071019,Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Keratin-7)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/enzymology/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*complications/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Keratin-7/metabolism', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/enzymology/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precancerous Conditions/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction', 'Streptozocin', 'Time Factors']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00125-007-0838-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2007 Dec;50(12):2580-90. doi: 10.1007/s00125-007-0838-2.

Here, we examined the pathway of caspase-3 activation using peptide substrates and caspase inhibitors. Using the substrates of caspases-8 and -9, it was found that both are activated in cells under high pressure. The production of nuclei with sub-G1 DNA content in 100 MPa-treated MEL cells was suppressed by inhibitors of caspases-8 and -9, and pan-caspase. In 100 MPa-treated cells, pan-caspase inhibitor partially prevented the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and the breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential. These results suggest that the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are activated in apoptotic signaling during the high pressure-induced death of MEL cells.","['Yamaguchi, Takeo', 'Hashiguchi, Kenji', 'Katsuki, Satoshi', 'Iwamoto, Wakako', 'Tsuruhara, Shoichiro', 'Terada, Shigeyuki']","['Yamaguchi T', 'Hashiguchi K', 'Katsuki S', 'Iwamoto W', 'Tsuruhara S', 'Terada S']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Fukuoka University, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan. takeo@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071019,England,Cell Mol Biol Lett,Cellular & molecular biology letters,9607427,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/enzymology/pathology', 'Pressure', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2478/s11658-007-0034-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Biol Lett. 2008;13(1):49-57. doi: 10.2478/s11658-007-0034-x.

Although each is linked with a specific disease their functional activity poses the question whether they have a degree of commonality in their effects upon target cells. Exon array analysis of the effects of six leukemogenic PTKs (BCR/ABL, TEL/PDGFRbeta, FIP1/PDGFRalpha, D816V KIT, NPM/ALK, and FLT3ITD) revealed few common effects on the transcriptome. It is apparent, however, that proteome changes are not directly governed by transcriptome changes. Therefore, we assessed and used a new generation of iTRAQ tagging, enabling eight-channel relative quantification discovery proteomics, to analyze the effects of these six leukemogenic PTKs. Again these were found to have disparate effects on the proteome with few common targets. BCR/ABL had the greatest effect on the proteome and had more effects in common with FIP1/PDGFRalpha. The proteomic effects of the four type III receptor kinases were relatively remotely related. The only protein commonly affected was eosinophil-associated ribonuclease 7. Five of six PTKs affected the motility-related proteins CAPG and vimentin, although this did not correspond to changes in motility. However, correlation of the proteomics data with that from the exon microarray not only showed poor levels of correlation between transcript and protein levels but also revealed alternative patterns of regulation of the CAPG protein by different oncogenes, illustrating the utility of such a combined approach.","['Pierce, Andrew', 'Unwin, Richard D', 'Evans, Caroline A', 'Griffiths, Stephen', 'Carney, Louise', 'Zhang, Liqun', 'Jaworska, Ewa', 'Lee, Chia-Fang', 'Blinco, David', 'Okoniewski, Michal J', 'Miller, Crispin J', 'Bitton, Danny A', 'Spooncer, Elaine', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Pierce A', 'Unwin RD', 'Evans CA', 'Griffiths S', 'Carney L', 'Zhang L', 'Jaworska E', 'Lee CF', 'Blinco D', 'Okoniewski MJ', 'Miller CJ', 'Bitton DA', 'Spooncer E', 'Whetton AD']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, University of Manchester, Christie Hospital, Kinnaird House, Kinnaird Road, Manchester M204QL, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071021,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteome/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)31175-0 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M700251-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2008 May;7(5):853-63. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M700251-MCP200.

Some tumor cells can be stimulated to reenter their differentiation program and to undergo terminal growth arrest. The in vitro differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells is an important example of tumor cell reprogramming. MEL cells are malignant erythroblasts that are blocked from differentiating into mature RBC due to dysregulated expression of the transcription factor PU.1, which binds to and represses GATA-1, the major transcriptional regulator of erythropoiesis. We used RNA interference to ask whether inhibiting PU.1 synthesis was sufficient to cause MEL cells to lose their malignant properties. We report here that transfection of MEL cells with a PU.1-specific short interfering RNA oligonucleotide causes the cells to resume erythroid differentiation, accumulate hemoglobin, and undergo terminal growth arrest. RNA interference directed at specific, aberrantly expressed transcription factors may hold promise for the development of potent antitumor therapies in other hematologic malignancies.","['Papetti, Michael', 'Skoultchi, Arthur I']","['Papetti M', 'Skoultchi AI']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2007/10/24 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/10/1053 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0145 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2007 Oct;5(10):1053-62. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0145.,,,PMC3190309,,"['R01 HL078381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '2P30CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1F32 HL077242-0102/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL78381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS327438'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we show alterations in F-actin distribution and cell cycle progression in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, resulting from treatment with these cytokines in vitro. We found that both agents caused F-actin reorganization. Although multiple potential effects of various growth factors have been described previously, in our experimental conditions, we observed some rather subtle differences between the effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on studied cells. The presence of these cytokines in the cell environment caused not only increased F-actin labeling in the cytoplasm, but also a weaker intensity of peripheral ring staining in comparison with control cells. In spite of the fact that HL60 cells exposed to G-CSF and GM-CSF contained different F-actin structures such as aggregates and F-actin network, the rate of actin polymerization was not significantly enhanced. Moreover, alterations were mainly related to considerable changes in the relative proportion of these different structures, what might be reflected by specific features of the differentiation process, with regard to the kind of stimulating factor used. Thus, reorganization of F-actin and other results obtained in our experimental conditions, might reflect unique characteristics of the differentiation process in HL-60 cells, involving low apoptosis frequency, the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle, as well as possible alternative ways of the cell death.","['Grzanka, Alina', 'Izdebska, Magdalena', 'Litwiniec, Anna', 'Grzanka, Dariusz', 'Safiejko-Mroczka, Barbara']","['Grzanka A', 'Izdebska M', 'Litwiniec A', 'Grzanka D', 'Safiejko-Mroczka B']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Nicolaus Copernicus University, The Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Poland. agrzanka@cm.umk.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Actins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*drug effects', 'Actins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/04/12 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['28/3/2007 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2007;45(3):191-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While in some cases, such as childhood leukemia, these treatments may cure patients, it is common knowledge that they are associated with serious side effects. The main conceptual reason for this is that neither cancer cells nor the cancer cause(s) are directly targeted.

Late infection incidence and risk factors were retrospectively determined in 196 long-term survivors after HLA matched related HSCT.

We tested the requirement of Sema4D expression on T cells in the induction of T cell allo-immune responses. Sema4D-/- T cells showed reduced expansion in vitro upon stimulation with allo-geneic antigen presenting cells (APCs) when compared to wild-type (wt) T cells. Similar in vitro results were observed using anti-Sema4D mAbs. Further studies demonstrated that the reduced proliferation was not due to intrinsic T cell defects, and that the cytotoxic functions were preserved. After allo-geneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), recipients of Sema4D-/- T cells showed reduced mortality and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) target organ damage. Allo-geneic dendritic cells (DCs) cocultured with Sema4D-/- responder T cells secreted less TNF-alpha and IL-12p70 compared to wt T cells. Similar reduction of DC function was observed with anti-Sema4D mAbs. Given the preservation of CTL function we evaluated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses. When BALB/c recipient mice were challenged with the P815 murine mastocytoma cell line (H2(d)) the recipients of allo-geneic Sema4D-/- B6 T cells showed a significant improvement in tumor free survival when compared to syngeneic recipients, thus demonstrating preservation of GVL, albeit of a lesser magnitude than allo-geneic wt T cells. In summary, Sema4D plays a significant role in mediating in vitro and in vivo allo-geneic responses by modulating T cell-APC interactions.","['Duran-Struuck, Raimon', 'Tawara, Isao', 'Lowler, Kathi', 'Clouthier, Shawn G', 'Weisiger, Elizabeth', 'Rogers, Clare', 'Luker, Gary', 'Kumanogoh, Atsushi', 'Liu, Chen', 'Ferrara, James L M', 'Reddy, Pavan']","['Duran-Struuck R', 'Tawara I', 'Lowler K', 'Clouthier SG', 'Weisiger E', 'Rogers C', 'Luker G', 'Kumanogoh A', 'Liu C', 'Ferrara JL', 'Reddy P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070921,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Sema4d protein, mouse)', '0 (Semaphorins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Semaphorins/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2007/10/24 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00371-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.07.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Nov;13(11):1294-1303. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.07.014.

Initial results with the use of mismatched allografts led to limited enthusiasm because of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infectious complications, resulting in an unacceptable treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Recent advances with effective T cell depletion, the use of a ""megadose"" of stem cells, earlier detection of severe infections, combined with better antimicrobial therapy and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has significantly decreased the early transplant-related mortality and GVHD, whereas enabling prompt engraftment, hence advancing the therapeutic benefit of haploidentical transplantation. However, the cardinal problems related to delayed immune reconstitution allowing posttransplant infectious complications and relapse remain, limiting the efficacy of haploidentical HSCT. Preliminary data has demonstrated the potential for use of adoptive cellular immunity and selective allodepletion in rapidly reconstituting immunity without GVHD. The encouraging reports from haploidentical transplant using noninherited maternal antigen (NIMA)-mismatched or natural killer (NK) alloreactive donors may greatly increase the donor availability and open the way to more appropriate donor selection in HLA-haploidentical HSCT. Future challenges remain in determining the safest approach for haploidentical transplant to be performed with minimal risk of GVHD, whereas preserving effective graft-versus-leukemia activity and promoting prompt immune reconstitution.","['Koh, Liang-Piu', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Chao, Nelson J']","['Koh LP', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Chao NJ']","['Adult Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Graft Survival/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation Tolerance/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2007/10/24 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00383-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Nov;13(11):1249-67. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.08.003.,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using blood samples withdrawn from 28 AL patients and 31 healthy controls, we found that, in the absence of exogenous WKYMVm, WKYMVm receptor and bactericidal activity did not differ between patients and controls. Addition of WKYMVm markedly increased the bactericidal activities of these cells in a dose-dependent manner. During induction chemotherapy, there were significant increases in bactericidal activity in the presence and absence of 1nM WKYMVm, with higher bactericidal activities at the time of complete remission than at the time of diagnosis or on day 15. During consolidation chemotherapy, WKYMVm had no effect on bactericidal activities. Patients showed significant increase in the concentrations of TNF alpha, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8, but significant decrease in the concentrations of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-12. TNF alpha, IL-1b and IL-6 showed significant negative correlations with bactericidal activities of patient neutrophils at time of diagnosis, and IL-4 showed a significant positive correlation with bactericidal activities.

It is specially important to find few genetic markers which can be explored for diagnostic purposes. The performance of a set of markers is often measured by the associated classification accuracy. This motivates our ranking of genes depending on the minimum probability of classification errors (MPE) for each gene. In this work, we use Bayesian decision-making algorithm to compute MPE. A quantile-based probability density estimation technique is used for generating probability density functions of genes. The method is tested on three datasets: colon cancer, leukaemia, and hereditary breast cancer. The quality of the selected markers is evaluated by the classification accuracy obtained using support-vector-machine and a modified naive Bayes classifier.

Further molecular analysis showed that deoxyschizandrin and gamma-schizandrin caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), cytochrome c release from mitochondrion to cytosol, truncation of Bid protein, and activation of caspase-3 and -9. However, they did not increase the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Although PLAGL2 is known to mainly act as a transcription factor, other functions which may contribute to its oncogenic potential are not clear. Pirh2 (P53 induced RING-H2 protein) is a p53 inducible E3 ligase involved in the ubiquitination of p53, while the mechanisms to regulate its activities are largely unknown. In this study, we show for the first time that Pirh2 forms dimers through its N- and C-terminus in cells and Pirh2 dimers interact with PLAGL2. The interaction between PLAGL2 and Pirh2 dimers prevents proteasomal degradation of Pirh2. This study thus uncovers a novel function of PLAGL2 as an oncoprotein through regulating the stability of Pirh2. Given the importance of Pirh2 in regulating p53 stability, its interaction with PLAGL2 may provide valuable therapeutic targets in treating Pirh2-overexpression malignancies.","['Zheng, Gang', 'Ning, Jinying', 'Yang, Yu-Chung']","['Zheng G', 'Ning J', 'Yang YC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 2109 Adelbert Road, W353, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071011,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PLAGL2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RCHY1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/01/26 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02150-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Dec 14;364(2):344-50. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.003.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to investigate this query, leukemia cells were cultured in presence of kinase inhibitors (KIs). Proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation were analyzed at the cellular and molecular levels, using flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: SB203580, a P38 MAPK inhibitor, had no effect on cell proliferation, whereas LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, and PD098059, a selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular regulated kinase (MEK) phosphorylation, arrested cells in G(0)/G(1). However, LY294002 and PD098059 acted using different mechanisms: LY294002 decreased the expression of phosphorylated S6RP, whereas PD098059 increased P21/waf1 antigen expression. SP600125, an inhibitor of N-terminal c-jun kinases, arrested cells in G(2) and induced an endoreplicative process. SP600125 increased p21 at both the mRNA and protein levels. G(2) blockage is dependent on the PI3K pathway and the endoreplicative process is dependent on the PI3K and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathways and mRNA synthesis. On the other hand, PD098059 potentiated the apoptotic process induced by either SP600125 or LY294002. Modulation of the expression of CD11, CD15, CD18, and CD54 was cell-dependent. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KIs modulate proliferation of leukemia cells and that the MEK/ERK inhibitor, PD098059, in combination with either SP600125 or LY294002, could have clinical value.","['Champelovier, Pierre', 'El Atifi, Michele', 'Pautre, Virginie', 'Rostaing, Beatrice', 'Berger, Francois', 'Seigneurin, Daniel']","['Champelovier P', 'El Atifi M', 'Pautre V', 'Rostaing B', 'Berger F', 'Seigneurin D']","[""Laboratoire de Dynamique Cellulaire de l'EPHE, Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.

Nuclear overexpression of the Wnt effector beta-catenin and deregulated beta-catenin nuclear signaling can promote malignant transformation in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, a role for beta-catenin in mast cell leukemia has not been described. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is upregulated by its tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that can be exacerbated by deregulated expression of oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Here, we investigated the relationship between activated KIT and beta-catenin signaling in mast cell leukemia. Beta-catenin was tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells with KIT activated by either gain-of-function mutation or incubation with the KIT ligand stem cell factor. Beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation depended on KIT activity but not on PI3K-AKT activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was associated with its nuclear localization and enhanced transcription of target genes c-myc and cyclin D1. Endogenous KIT and beta-catenin were found to associate in mast cell leukemia cells, and in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that active KIT phosphorylates tyrosine residues of beta-catenin directly. Aberrant beta-catenin-driven transcription caused by deregulated KIT may represent a significant new target for treatment of mast cell leukemia.","['Kajiguchi, Tomohiro', 'Lee, Sunmin', 'Lee, Min-Jung', 'Trepel, Jane B', 'Neckers, Len']","['Kajiguchi T', 'Lee S', 'Lee MJ', 'Trepel JB', 'Neckers L']","['Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1107, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071018,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00343-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 May;32(5):761-70. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.023.

Thus, identification of new therapeutic strategies and targets is a high priority. The semisynthetic geldanamycin derivative 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) inhibits heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) binding to client proteins, thereby leading to their degradation. We demonstrate that at biologically active and clinically attainable levels (1 mumol/l), 17-AAG treatment of CLL B cells in vitro causes modest apoptosis as well as decreased AKT protein levels. Given the potential activation of AKT following antibody therapy in CLL, we evaluated the combination of 17-AAG and rituximab. These agents produced synergistic cytotoxicity of CLL cells in vitro. However, rituximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was modestly reduced with 17-AAG, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity was not altered. We conclude that the combination of Hsp90 inhibitors with therapeutic antibodies, such as rituximab may represent a novel strategy to enhance therapeutic response in CLL. Furthermore, our data indicates that AKT and Hsp70 protein levels are relevant pharmacodynamic endpoints to monitor the in vivo effect of 17-AAG therapy.","['Johnson, Amy J', 'Wagner, Amy J', 'Cheney, Carolyn M', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Lucas, David M', 'Guster, Sara K', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Byrd, John C']","['Johnson AJ', 'Wagner AJ', 'Cheney CM', 'Smith LL', 'Lucas DM', 'Guster SK', 'Grever MR', 'Lin TS', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. amy.johnson@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071019,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Drug Synergism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6878 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06878.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Dec;139(5):837-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06878.x.

Apoptosis, scavenging of radicals, antioxidant, and pro-oxidant characteristics are primarily responsible for the antitumor activities of phenolic compounds. Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies on the cellular apoptosis and cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds have been investigated recently by Selassie and colleagues (J Med Chem; 48:7234, 2005) wherein models were developed for various carcinogenic cell lines. These quantitative structure-activity relationship models are based on few experimentally obtained physicochemical parameters such as Verloop's sterimol descriptor, hydrophobicity, Hammett electronic parameter, and octanol/water partition coefficient. The paper deals with structure-activity relationships of phenols and its derivatives for the development of predictive models from the standpoint of theoretical structural parameters and ridge regression methodology. The quantitative structure-activity relationship studies developed here for the caspase-mediated apoptosis activity and cytotoxicity on murine leukemia cell line (L1210), human promylolytic cell line (HL-60), human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), parenteral human acute lymphoblastic cells (CCRF-CEM), and multidrug-resistant subline of CCRF-resistant to vinblastine (CEM/VLB) cells utilize physicochemical molecular descriptors calculated solely from the structure of phenolic compounds under investigation along with the descriptors used by Selassie and group. It is seen that such quantitative structure-activity relationships can provide a better quality predictive model for the phenolic compounds. The biological activities of the nine sets of phenolic compounds have been calculated based on ridge regression analysis that clearly gives a better significant correlation compared to the activities predicted by Selassie and co-workers. Counter-propagation artificial neural network studies have been introduced in the present investigation for a better understanding of multidimensional rational patterns in more complex data sets. The counter-propagation artificial neural network studies were performed on the same data set and with the same descriptors as have been carried out in developing ridge regression models and the result of counter-propagation neural network models produces very interesting findings in terms of leave-one-out test. Finally, an attempt has been made for a comparative study of the relative effectiveness of linear statistical methods versus nonlinear techniques, such as counter-propagation neural networks in modeling structure-activity studies of the phenolic compounds.","['Nandi, Sisir', 'Vracko, Marjan', 'Bagchi, Manish C']","['Nandi S', 'Vracko M', 'Bagchi MC']","['Structural Biology and Bioinformatics Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

The cell volume of 4nH1K cells was about twice of that of diploid cells, indicating that 4nH1K cells contained about twice as much total intracellular material as 2nH1 cells. The morphology of the 4nH1K cells was flagstone-like, thus differing from that of the spindle-shaped 2nH1 cells, suggesting that morphological transformation occurred during the diploid-tetraploid transition. 4nH1K cells exhibited alkaline phosphatase activity and formed teratocarcinomas, implying that they were pluripotent. These characteristics of 4nH1K cells were similar to those of tetraploid 4nH1 cells that have been established through polyploidization by demecolcine, suggesting that 4nH1K and 4nH1 cells are similar irrespective of the different mechanisms of polyploidization.","['Fujikawa-Yamamoto, Kohzaburo', 'Miyagoshi, Minoru', 'Yamagishi, Hiroko']","['Fujikawa-Yamamoto K', 'Miyagoshi M', 'Yamagishi H']","['Cell Medicine, Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa, Japan. fujikawa@kanazawa-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/enzymology/pathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Indole Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', '*Polyploidy', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['HUC034 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-0774.2007.00034.x [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2007 Nov;20(4):91-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-0774.2007.00034.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a Q-sort task, participants arranged the vignettes along a bipolar scale according to their willingness to interact with the persons, and were asked to explain their decisions. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that IDU, AIDS, and CS were all individually stigmatizing. Strong interactions were found between the stigmas of HIV/AIDS, IDU, and CS.

In recent years, some effort has been made in developing T-cell specific immunity against neoplasmatic cells. Reconstitution of effective costimulation and immunological response of host T-cells against CLL cells could be a potential approach in immunotherapeutic trials. CD40/CD40L system is involved in the survival and proliferation of normal and neoplasmatic B-cells. Some preclinical studies have shown that CD40 stimulation can differentiate leukemic cells into dendritic cells (DCs) and result in host response. In this study, we sought to determine whether B-CLL cells could be turned into efficient and functional antigen presenting cells, as well as to assess the type of allogeneic T-cell response against B-CLL - derived DCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: B-CLL cells from 25 patients were cultured with or without the presence of CD40L and IL-4 for 96 hours and then cultured in mixed lymphocyte reaction with allogeneic T-cells. RESULTS: 1) after CD40 stimulation B-CLL cells achieved phenotypical and functional characterization of DCs (i.e. upregulated co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules at mRNA and protein level) 2) leukemia-derived DCs expressed higher amount of mRNA for chemokines involved in T-cell migration (MDC, TARC and CCR7) 3) the proliferating response of Tcells against leukemia-derived DCs consisted of CD4 and CD8 cells (upregulation of HLA-DR and OX40). CONCLUSIONS: our experiment confirm that B-CLL cells can be turned into dendritic-like cells, additionally, these cells express chemokines involved in T-cell migration and stimulate allogeneic response.","['Luczynski, W', 'Stasiak-Barmuta, A', 'Piszcz, J', 'Ilendo, E', 'Kowalczuk, O', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, M']","['Luczynski W', 'Stasiak-Barmuta A', 'Piszcz J', 'Ilendo E', 'Kowalczuk O', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland. w.luczynski@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines/*biosynthesis', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, OX40/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2007;54(6):527-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impacts of JNK2/p38 suppression on gene expression profile of CML cell lines (K562/KU-812) were studied using an experimental approach that combines siRNA-mediated specific inhibition of the genes and array-based expression analyses. After JNK2 depletion, 27 out of 588 tested genes showed significant expression changes, with 13 down-regulated genes and 14 up-regulated genes. Among others, expression of MSH2 and MSH6, mdm2, and caspase-2 was reduced and, on the other hand, MKK1 and MKK6, RFC2, cytokeratins K18 and K19, BAD, and DR5 expression was up-regulated. In the case of p38 silencing, 20 genes were considered as significantly deregulated (7 genes reduced, 13 over-expressed). These genes included caspase-10, SOD1, and Notch4 (down-regulation) and caspase-2 and caspase-3, CDC2, CDK4, and c-kit (up-regulation). In conclusion, comparison of expression profiles after JNK2 or p38 gene silencing revealed distinct sets of affected genes. The results implied an unequal impact of the MAPK deregulation on the CML cells. Further, we demonstrated that neither JNK2 nor p38 siRNAmediated inhibition led to significant change of CML cell proliferation. It suggests that there are other important, likely upstream regulators essential for CML malignant cell growth/transformation; therefore, separate inhibition of JNK2 or p38 MAPK gene is not sufficient for a proliferation arrest.","['Merkerova, M', 'Bruchova, H', 'Brdicka, R']","['Merkerova M', 'Bruchova H', 'Brdicka R']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Department of Molecular Genetics, Prague, U nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/*biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2007;54(6):503-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study includes bone marrow samples from 36 controls, 27 patients with AML, 39 patients with B-ALL undergoing therapy who remained in complete remission after treatment and also 30 B-ALL patients one year after the end of therapy. We observed substantial expansion of immature bone marrow populations in the regenerating bone marrows, which were identified by expression of CD34 and/or CD117 markers by 4-color flow cytometry. Myeloid precursors were significantly increased after cessation of induction therapy cycle of B-ALL (1.27+/-2.04%, p=0.0064) and also AML patients (0.87+/-0.77%, p=0.001), but also during follow-up of B-ALL patients (1.42+/-2.36%, p=0.0001) when compared with non-treated controls (0.38+/-0.29%). Some cases where their frequencies achieved up to 12% reflect the massive regeneration of myeloid lineage in bone marrow after chemotherapy cycles. Especially in these cases accurate interpretation of such a high frequency of immature myeloid cells as myeloid precursors was very important to exclude incoming relapse or secondary leukemia. The myeloid precursors represented by CD34+ in regenerating bone marrow expressed CD45 (94.8+/-5.5%), CD117 (38.3+/-26.2%), CD38 (91.4+/-5.7%), HLA-DR (90.6+/-7.6%), CD13 (73.0+/-20.8%) and CD33 (85.2+/-15.6%), while CD90 (2.7+/-2.5%), CD133 (10.0+/-8.2%) and T or B lymphocyte markers were negative. Comparing immunophenotypes with control bone marrows, only difference in expression of CD33 marker was found (85.2+/-15.6% versus 63.0+/-17.4% p=0.024). In addition, according to expression of these markers three different subsets of myeloid precursor cells were identified in regenerating bone marrow samples: CD34+ CD117- HLA-DR+, CD34+ CD117+ HLA-DR+ and CD34- CD117+ HLA-DR-/+ without aberrant marker expression. In conclusion for the correct discrimination of MRD in acute leukemia it is indispensable to define the range of normality in myeloid differentiation by extensive studies of bone marrows not only from healthy donors but also from regenerating bone marrow of patients undergoing therapy.","['Zeleznikova, T', 'Stevulova, L', 'Kovarikova, A', 'Babusikova, O']","['Zeleznikova T', 'Stevulova L', 'Kovarikova A', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 833 91 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exontzel@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual']",2007/10/24 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2007;54(6):471-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the high reactivity of AcITC towards thiols, its effects on leukemia cells were similar to naturally occurring isothiocyanates. AcITC changed the intracellular level of glutathione (GSH), and induced apoptosis. Arrest of cell cycle (G2/M-phase) was also observed. AcITC primarily reacted with -SH groups on cellular surface, and the study of the interaction of the isotiocyanate with human erythrocyte ghosts confirmed that the plasma membrane was the first place where AcITC bound.

METHODS: The long-term outcomes were analyzed in 1069 consecutive AML patients in first CR who were diagnosed and treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1991 and 2003. RESULTS.: The failure rates as yearly risk of treatment failure were 69.1 in the first year, 37.7 in the second year, 17.0 in the third year, 7.6 in the fourth year, and 6.6 in the fifth year, suggesting that 3 years from the CR date is a convenient time to consider patients potentially cured. The effect of cytogenetics on relapse-free survival (RFS) remained constant throughout the first 3 years, whereas the effect of age increased with time. The probability of RFS for patients alive without disease recurrence at 3 years was 84.0% at 6 years. When the interaction between age and cytogenetics was examined for these patients, the outcomes of those with favorable cytogenetics were found to be excellent regardless of age. However, in the intermediate cytogenetic group, although patients aged <60 years had excellent outcomes, those aged > or =60 years were found to be at a substantial risk of disease recurrence even after 3 years of CR, with a 6-year RFS rate of 56.5%. There were only 6 patients with adverse cytogenetics in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that the risk of treatment failure differs over time according to a combination of cytogenetics and age.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Yanada M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Borthakur G', 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian H', 'Estey E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Many methods exist for conducting phase II trials under the assumption that patients are homogeneous. In the presence of patient heterogeneity, however, these designs are likely to draw incorrect conclusions. We propose a class of model-based Bayesian designs for single-arm phase II trials with a binary or time-to-event outcome and two or more prognostic subgroups. The designs' early stopping rules are subgroup specific and allow the possibility of terminating some subgroups while continuing others, thus providing superior results when compared with designs that ignore treatment-subgroup interactions. Because our formulation requires informative priors on standard treatment parameters and subgroup main effects, and non-informative priors on experimental treatment parameters and treatment-subgroup interactions, we provide an algorithm for computing prior hyperparameter values.

Our specific objectives were to improve antibody selection criteria, identify a cell permeabilization procedure better tailored to ZAP-70 analysis, as well as to establish objective criteria to control antigen stability. METHODS: Sequentially titrated 2F3.2-FITC, 1E7.2-FITC, and 1E7.2-Alexa Fluor 488 anti-ZAP-70 antibodies were used to stain normal B and T cells and Scatchard analysis was applied to calculate K(d) and B(max) values from saturation curves of specific binding. ZAP-70 staining was compared in cells permeabilized with two commercially available kits, Triton X-100, and a custom saponin procedure. RESULTS: Normal B-cells were found to provide an excellent measure of nonspecific staining while varying ZAP-70 antibodies and concentrations. Comparing Scatchard analyses of specific T-cell binding revealed that 1E7.2-Alexa Fluor 488 had the highest binding affinity of the tested anti-ZAP-70 antibodies and was the best choice. The highest levels of ZAP-70 fluorescence occurred when cells were permeabilized using a noncommercial saponin procedure. Decrease of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell viability correlated with diminished ZAP-70 expression; when viability was lower than 95% the percentage of bright positive samples was significantly decreased, indicating a possibility of false-negative results. CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency and reliability of flow cytometric detection of ZAP-70 can be optimized by using Scatchard analysis to help select the most effective antibodies and antibody concentrations that maximize specific to nonspecific binding, by using a ""custom"" ZAP-70 permeabilization procedure, and by better controlling antigen stability by measuring cell viability.","['Preobrazhensky, Sergey N', 'Bahler, David W']","['Preobrazhensky SN', 'Bahler DW']","['ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. preobrs@aruplab.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In contrast, CNS-directed therapy is essential for all patients with ALL because without it, the majority of patients eventually will experience relapse. To approach this discrepancy and to explore potential distinct biologic properties of leukemic cells that migrate into the CNS, we compared gene expression profiles of childhood ALL patients with initial CNS involvement with the profiles of CNS-negative patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated leukemic gene expression profiles from the bone marrow of 17 CNS-positive patients and 26 CNS-negative patients who were frequency matched for risk factors associated with CNS involvement. Results were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and validated using independent patient samples. RESULTS: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) expression was consistently upregulated in leukemic cells of CNS-positive patients compared with CNS-negative patients. In multivariate analysis, IL-15 expression levels greater than the median were associated with CNS involvement compared with expression equal to or less than the median (odds ratio [OR] = 10.70; 95% CI, 2.95 to 38.81). Diagnostic likelihood ratios for CNS positivity were 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.65) for the first and 6.93 (95% CI, 2.55 to 18.83) for the fourth IL-15 expression quartiles. In patients who were CNS negative at diagnosis, IL-15 levels greater than the median were associated with subsequent CNS relapse compared with expression equal to or less than the median (OR = 13.80; 95% CI, 3.38 to 56.31). CONCLUSION: Quantification of leukemic IL-15 expression at diagnosis predicts CNS status and could be a new tool to further tailor CNS-directed therapy in childhood ALL.","['Cario, Gunnar', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Teichert, Anja', 'Rhein, Peter', 'Skokowa, Julia', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Welte, Karl', 'Schunemann, Holger J', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin']","['Cario G', 'Izraeli S', 'Teichert A', 'Rhein P', 'Skokowa J', 'Moricke A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Schrauder A', 'Karawajew L', 'Ludwig WD', 'Welte K', 'Schunemann HJ', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Schrappe M', 'Stanulla M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism']",2007/10/20 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/10/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/30/4813 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.8166 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 20;25(30):4813-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.8166.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the CD8 T cell response at mucosal sites, we targeted the Ag to MAdCAM-1, a mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule expressed mainly by high endothelial venules (HEV) in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and Peyer's patches of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. When chemical conjugates of anti-MAdCAM-1 Ab and model Ag OVA were injected i.v., a greatly enhanced proliferative response of Ag-specific OT-I CD8 T cells was detected in MLN. This was preceded by prolonged accumulation, up to 2 wk, of the anti-MAdCAM OVA conjugate on HEV of Peyer's patches and MLN. In contrast, nontargeted OVA conjugate was very inefficient in inducing OT-I CD8 T cell proliferation in MLN and required at least 20-fold more Ag to induce a comparable response. In addition, MAdCAM targeting elicits an endogenous OVA-specific CD8 T cell response, evident by IFN-gamma production and target killing. Induced response offers protection against an OVA-expressing B cell lymphoma. We propose that the augmentation of gut CD8 T cell responses by MAdCAM targeting is due to both accumulation of Ag in the HEV and conversion of a soluble Ag to a cell-associated one, allowing cross-presentation by DCs.","['Bourges, Dorothee', 'Zhan, Yifan', 'Brady, Jamie L', 'Braley, Hal', 'Caminschi, Irina', 'Prato, Sandro', 'Villadangos, Jose A', 'Lew, Andrew M']","['Bourges D', 'Zhan Y', 'Brady JL', 'Braley H', 'Caminschi I', 'Prato S', 'Villadangos JA', 'Lew AM']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'CD11c Antigen/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Priming/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Intestines/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Ovalbumin/immunology']",2007/10/20 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/10/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['179/9/5678 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.9.5678 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Nov 1;179(9):5678-85. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.9.5678.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, accurately assessing energy expenditure (EE) is important in planning adequate nutrition support. Indirect calorimetry (IC) represents the gold standard method but is not always available or applicable to all settings. The purpose of this study was to preliminary compare a new wearable device, the SenseWear armband (SWA), to IC in cancer patients. METHODS: Ten (6 M, 4 F) subjects (mean +/- SD: 56.6 +/- 13.3 years) affected by newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia, undergoing induction chemotherapy, were prospectively enrolled. Resting EE (REE) was measured simultaneously by SWA and IC on admission (day 0) and at discharge (end). Total daily EE (TDEE) was determined by SWA 4 times during the stay (days 0, 7, 14, and end) and predicted values were calculated according to IC REE estimates (TDEE = IC x correction factor 1.2). RESULTS: Mean length of stay was 27.1 +/- 6.2 days. Bland-Altman plots revealed no significant differences between overall REE estimates (day 0 + end) performed by IC and SWA (mean +/- SD; 1645 +/- 282 vs 1705 +/- 278 kcal/d) and the correlation was high (r = 0.84; p < .0001). SWA TDEE showed a progressive reduction during the stay. No bias was detected between overall SWA TDEE (1799 +/- 153 kcal/d) and IC predicted TDEE (1974 +/- 176 kcal/d), but there was a wide 95% confidence interval (-672; +321 kcal/d). Moreover, the correlation between these values was significant (r = 0.68; p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: SWA seems to provide accurate and reliable estimation of REE and useful information on TDEE also in cancer patients. Its use appears promising.

Although CCR is usually durable, a minority of patients relapse. Biomarkers capable of predicting those CCR patients with a higher risk of relapse would improve therapeutic management. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To assess whether changes in BCR-ABL RNA levels are a prognostic biomarker predictive of relapse, we regularly monitored transcript levels [every 3 months (median)] in 90 patients with CCR during 49 months (median) of imatinib therapy. RESULTS: Throughout follow-up, the 20 patients with eventual relapse had higher transcript levels than the durable responders. Major molecular response (MMR; >3-log reduction of BCR-ABL RNA) was attained by 76 patients (12 with subsequent relapse) and was a significant predictor of prolonged relapse-free survival (P = 0.0008). A minimal 0.5-log increase in transcripts (before relapse; experienced by 42 patients, 16 with subsequent relapse) conveyed a significantly shorter relapse-free survival (P = 0.0017). Loss of MMR (transcript increase to <2.5-log reduction, before relapse; experienced by 33 patients, 11 with subsequent relapse) was also predictive of shortened relapse-free survival (P = 0.0003). A complete molecular response (undetectable transcripts by nested PCR) was attained by 28 MMR patients (one with subsequent relapse) and conveyed a significantly prolonged relapse-free survival (P = 0.0052). CONCLUSIONS: In chronic myeloid leukemia patients with an imatinib-induced CCR, a minimal half-log increase in BCR-ABL RNA (including loss of MMR) is a significant risk factor for future relapse. The achievement of a complete molecular response imparts longer progression-free survival than the achievement of an MMR.","['Press, Richard D', 'Galderisi, Chad', 'Yang, Rui', 'Rempfer, Carole', 'Willis, Stephanie G', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Deininger, Michael W N']","['Press RD', 'Galderisi C', 'Yang R', 'Rempfer C', 'Willis SG', 'Mauro MJ', 'Druker BJ', 'Deininger MW']","['Department of Pathology, Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Cancer Institute, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97201, USA. pressr@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/10/20 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/10/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/20/6136 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1112 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Oct 15;13(20):6136-43. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1112.,,,,,"['HL082978-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA095203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survivin is a bifunctional inhibitor of apoptosis protein that has been implicated in protection from apoptosis and regulation of mitosis. Several clinical trials targeting survivin with a collection of different approaches from small molecule antagonists to immunotherapy are currently under way. With regard to the latter, spontaneous anti-survivin T-cell reactivity has been described in cancer patients suffering from a huge range of cancers of different origin, e.g., breast and colon cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. Thus, survivin may serve as a universal target antigen for anticancer immunotherapy. Accordingly, down-regulation of survivin as a means of immune escape would severely inflict the survival capacity of tumor cells, which highlights this protein as a prime target candidate for therapeutic vaccinations against cancer. Data from several ongoing phase I/II trials targeting survivin for patients with advanced cancer will provide further information about this idea.","['Andersen, Mads Hald', 'Svane, Inge Marie', 'Becker, Jurgen C', 'Straten, Per Thor']","['Andersen MH', 'Svane IM', 'Becker JC', 'Straten PT']","['Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Department of Hematology, Herlev University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark. mahaan01@heh.regionh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/metabolism']",2007/10/20 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/10/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/20/5991 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0686 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Oct 15;13(20):5991-4. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0686.,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of extracellular nucleotides are mediated by P2 receptors, among which the P2X(7) subtype is attracting increasing attention for its involvement in apoptosis, cell growth, and cytokine release. Recent studies showed that P2X(7) is overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast and prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to better understand the clinical significance of P2X(7) receptor expression in normal and cancer human thyroid tissues. P2X(7) receptor message and protein expression and functional activity were tested in two cell lines (FB1 and FB2) established from either anaplastic or papillary primary thyroid cancer and in several histological samples of human papillary cancer. We show here that human thyroid papillary carcinoma, whether of the classical or follicular variant, expresses the P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R) to a much higher level than normal thyroid tissue. The P2X(7)R was similarly up-regulated in FB1 and FB2 cell lines. In contrast to normal thyroid cells, both cell lines responded to extracellular nucleotide stimulation with a large increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and secretion of IL-6. Ca(2+) increase was attenuated and release of IL-6 was fully blocked by P2X(7)R inhibitors. Finally, the thyroid carcinoma cell lines had at least a 3-fold higher intracellular ATP concentration and maintained at least a 3-fold higher extracellular ATP level, compared with control cells. These data suggest that an enhanced P2X(7)R function might be a feature of human thyroid cancer.","['Solini, Anna', 'Cuccato, Sabina', 'Ferrari, Davide', 'Santini, Eleonora', 'Gulinelli, Sara', 'Callegari, Maria Giulia', 'Dardano, Angela', 'Faviana, Pinuccia', 'Madec, Stephanie', 'Di Virgilio, Francesco', 'Monzani, Fabio']","['Solini A', 'Cuccato S', 'Ferrari D', 'Santini E', 'Gulinelli S', 'Callegari MG', 'Dardano A', 'Faviana P', 'Madec S', 'Di Virgilio F', 'Monzani F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 67, I-56100 Pisa, Italy. a.solini@med.unipi.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071018,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7', 'Thyroid Gland/metabolism', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/10/20 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/10/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2007-1223 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2007-1223 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2008 Jan;149(1):389-96. doi: 10.1210/en.2007-1223.

METHODS: We reviewed clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)] characteristics of this complication in pediatric cancer patients treated from 2000 to 2006. RESULTS: Six of 754 (0.8%) patients with leukemia or lymphoma and 2 of 44 (4.5%) with bone sarcoma experienced acute encephalopathy within 2 weeks (median, 7.5 days) after receiving high-dose i.v. and/or intrathecal MTX. The signs and symptoms varied at presentation and during episodes: hemiparesis (eight patients, alternating from side to side in four), dysphasia (six), confusion/emotionality (six), headache (three), choreoathetosis (two), and seizure (two). All patients recovered after 1-7 days (median, 5.5 days). DWI revealed restricted diffusion in anatomic brain regions associated with the symptoms; changes on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging were consistently less marked. After recovery, DWI findings were normal but T2 and/or FLAIR imaging usually showed residual abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Acute MTX toxicity often manifests as fluctuating neurologic symptoms with alternating hemispheric involvement. Restricted diffusion on DWI is a reliable early sign of acute MTX encephalopathy and resolves as clinical status improves, despite the persistence of subtle abnormalities on MRI.","['Inaba, H', 'Khan, R B', 'Laningham, F H', 'Crews, K R', 'Pui, C-H', 'Daw, N C']","['Inaba H', 'Khan RB', 'Laningham FH', 'Crews KR', 'Pui CH', 'Daw NC']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071017,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '27Y3KJK423 (Aminophylline)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Aminophylline/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Brain/drug effects/*pathology', 'Child', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Female', 'Histiocytoma, Malignant Fibrous/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/10/20 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/10/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41115-0 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdm466 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Jan;19(1):178-84. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdm466.

This domain is separated from the carboxy terminal C domain (Cdom) of SU by a proline-rich region. In this study, we show that the Cdom region in the SU from subgroup C feline leukemia virus (FeLV-C) forms a second receptor-binding domain that is distinct from its RBD, and which can independently bind to its host receptor FLVCR1, in the absence of RBD. Furthermore, our results suggest that residues located in the C2 disulfide-bonded loop in FeLV-C Cdom are critical for SU binding to FLVCR1 and for virus infection. We propose that binding of FeLV-C SU to FLVCR1 involves interaction of two receptor-binding domains (RBD and Cdom) with FLVCR1, and that this mechanism of interaction is conserved for other gammaretroviruses. Our results could have important implications for designing gammaretrovirus vectors that can efficiently infect specific target cells.","['Rey, Michelle A', 'Prasad, Rati', 'Tailor, Chetankumar S']","['Rey MA', 'Prasad R', 'Tailor CS']","['Program in Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X8.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071022,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (feline leukemia virus protein p15E)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/classification/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Virulence']",2007/10/20 09:00,2008/02/21 09:00,['2007/10/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(07)00604-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2007.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2008 Jan 20;370(2):273-84. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2007.09.011.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human tongue carcinoma Tca8113 cells were cultured with the GSI L-685 458. Cell growth was determined by the methylthiazole tetrazolium method. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry and/or confocal microscopy. RT-PCR and Western blot were employed to determine the intracellular expression levels. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: L-685,458 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of human tongue carcinoma Tca8113 cells by inducing G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The mRNA and protein levels of Hairy/Enhancer of Split-1, a target of Notch activation, were decreased dose-dependently by L-685,458. Furthermore, L-685,458 down-regulated cyclin D1, B-cell lymphocytic-leukemia proto-oncogene 2 and c-Myc expressions, which are regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB.

Both linear and dendrimer structures have been prepared to achieve enhanced lipophilicity. After incubation in foetal calf serum the lipophilic conjugates showed a higher stability to hydrolysis with respect to the parent drug. In a preliminary in vitro biological assay, LAA conjugates showed the ability to retain or improve the growth inhibitory activity of the parent peptide against a human lymphoblastoid cell line. The interaction of the prepared conjugates with 1,2-L-alpha-dimiristoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar liposomes, chosen as a biological membrane model, was studied. The higher lipophilicity of TP5 conjugates was reflected in a better penetration through phospholipid bilayers, whose thermal behaviour was altered in a concentration-dependent way. Such enhanced affinity of TP5-LAA conjugates for this membrane model could anticipate a better interaction with cell membranes and, ultimately, an improved biological activity of compounds compared with the parent pentapeptide.","['Pignatello, R', 'Pecora, T M G']","['Pignatello R', 'Pecora TM']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Citta Universitaria, viale A.

Here, we provide further evidence that ABT-869 treatment significantly downregulates cyclins D and E but increases the expression of p21 and p27. ABT-869 induces apoptosis through downregulation of Bcl-xL and upregulation of BAK, BID and BAD. We also evaluate the combinations of ABT-869 and chemotherapy. ABT-869 demonstrates significant sequence-dependent synergism with cytarabine and doxorubicin in cell lines and primary leukemia samples. The optimal combination was validated in MV4-11 xenografts. Low-density array analysis revealed the synergistic interaction involved in downregulation of cell cycle and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway genes. CCND1 and c-Mos were the most significantly inhibited targets on both transcriptional and translational levels. Treatment with short hairpin RNAs targeting either CCND1 or c-Mos further sensitized MV4-11 cells to ABT-869. These findings suggest that specific pathway genes were further targeted by adding chemotherapy and support the rationale of combination therapy.

To harmonize BCR-ABL mRNA quantification an international multicenter trial involving 37 laboratories in 14 countries was initiated using 10 samples, each containing various dilutions (10, 2, 1 and 0.1%) of b3a2 or b2a2 BCR-ABL positive in normal leukocytes and negative controls. A novel control plasmid (pME-2) was designed for external calibration containing BCR-ABL and glucuronidase-beta (GUS) sequences. Median BCR-ABL/ABL ratios were 9.1, 1.8, 0.85 and 0.11% in b3a2 samples and 9.5, 1.6, 0.84 and 0.11% in b2a2 samples.

The coefficients of variation were 0.62 for ratios BCR-ABL/ABL and 1.03 for ratios BCR-ABL/GUS. Five of 37 evaluable participating laboratories (13%) detected low BCR-ABL copy numbers in negative control samples; one laboratory failed to detect BCR-ABL in a low-level sample.

We examined the release of Ang-1 and Ang-2 by AML cells cultured alone and in cocultures with stromal cells. Detectable Ang-1 release from AML cells was observed for most patients (62/91), whereas Ang-2 release was detected only for a minority (23/91). Coculture of AML and stromal cells led to increased Ang-1 levels. Furthermore, the role of the angiopoietin system was investigated by characterizing whether the differences in angiopoietin expression in AML patients can be related to nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations. We compared the gene expression profiles of AML cells derived from 19 patients with FLT3 mutations and normal cytogenetics with and without NPM1 mutations and observed increased expression of Ang-1 in patients with NPM1 mutations. Finally, we found significantly higher Ang-2 levels in serum of AML patients compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that AML cells are a major source of Ang-1 in leukemic bone marrow, especially in patients with NPM1 mutations, but the local levels are also influenced by stromal cells. Local Ang-2 release from AML cells is less common, but high systemic levels of Ang-2 may affect bone marrow angioregulation.","['Hatfield, K J', 'Hovland, R', 'Oyan, A M', 'Kalland, K H', 'Ryningen, A', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Bruserud, O']","['Hatfield KJ', 'Hovland R', 'Oyan AM', 'Kalland KH', 'Ryningen A', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Section of Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071018,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiopoietin-1/analysis/*metabolism', 'Angiopoietin-2/analysis/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404985 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404985 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):287-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404985.

However, there is emerging need to implement diagnostics and patient classification based on other biological features, such as expression levels of specific genes or genomic polymorphisms and/or mutations. This advancement would ideally be pursued in a diagnostic laboratory by an unique platform capable of different diagnostic purposes. We developed a rapid, accurate and reproducible assay to screen for the most common fusion gene transcripts in human leukemia, which combines a multiplex RT-PCR approach with the electronic hybridization and fluorescent detection on the Nanogen NanoChip Molecular Biology Workstation. This study demonstrates, as a proof-of-principle, that this microelectronic device, highly effective in detecting single base mutations, is also efficient in the analysis of gene expression, thus providing as a multi-purpose platform for relevant comprehensive diagnostics of hemato-oncology patients.","['Corradi, B', 'Fazio, G', 'Palmi, C', 'Rossi, V', 'Biondi, A', 'Cazzaniga, G']","['Corradi B', 'Fazio G', 'Palmi C', 'Rossi V', 'Biondi A', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, MI, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20071018,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling/instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Microchip Analytical Procedures/*methods', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/instrumentation/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*instrumentation/methods', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404987 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404987 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):294-302. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404987.

Pim2 protein is induced by oncogenic Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3)-internal tandem duplications (ITD), but not by Flt3 wild-type receptor (Flt3-Wt) in response to Flt3 ligand (FL). Here we show that Pim2 can complement Flt3-Wt signaling and induce transformation similar to Flt3-ITD in myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that Pim2 is necessary but not sufficient for Flt3-ITD-induced transformation of 32D cells and primary bone marrow cells as assessed by colony assays. Pim2-induced clonogenic growth of FL-treated 32D-Flt3-Wt cells. Proliferation of 32D-Flt3-Wt cells was significantly enhanced in FL-treated Pim2-overexpressing cells. This increase was associated with enhanced S-phase cell cycle progression. Pim2-overexpressing cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation or treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PKC412). The Flt3 point mutant D835Y, which is not able to support colony growth of myeloid cells, also induced clonogenic growth in the presence of Pim2. In conclusion, Pim2 is an important target of Flt3-ITD-induced transformation, and overexpression of Pim2 together with Flt3-Wt or D835Y receptor mimics Flt3-ITD-mediated transformation. Pim2 complements with Flt3-Wt signaling to induce proliferation by enhancing G(1)/S-phase progression of the cell cycle.","['Agrawal, S', 'Koschmieder, S', 'Baumer, N', 'Reddy, N G P', 'Berdel, W E', 'Muller-Tidow, C', 'Serve, H']","['Agrawal S', 'Koschmieder S', 'Baumer N', 'Reddy NG', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071018,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Pim2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'S Phase/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404988 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404988 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jan;22(1):78-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404988.

Previous animal studies showed activity against solid tumors and Adriamycin-resistant leukemia. We initially sought to test the proposed Top2-mediated DNA cleavage activity of batracylin and identify potential biomarkers for activity. COMPARE analysis in the NCI-60 cell lines showed batracylin activity to be most closely related to the class of Top2 inhibitors. The 50% growth inhibition (GI50) value for batracylin in HT29 colon carcinoma cells was 10 micromol/L. DNA-protein cross-links, consistent with Top2 targeting, were measured by alkaline elution. DNA single-strand breaks were also detected and found to be protein associated. However, only a weak induction of DNA double-strand breaks was observed. Because batracylin induced almost exclusively DNA single-strand breaks, we tested batracylin as a Top1 inhibitor. Batracylin exhibited both Top1- and Top2alpha/beta-mediated DNA cleavage in vitro and in cells. The phosphorylation of histone (gamma-H2AX) was tested to measure the extent of DNA damage. Kinetics of gamma-H2AX ""foci"" showed early activation with low micromol/L concentrations, thus presenting a useful early biomarker of DNA damage. The half-life of gamma-H2AX signal reversal after drug removal was consistent with reversal of DNA-protein cross-links. The persistence of the DNA-protein complexes induced by batracylin was markedly longer than by etoposide or camptothecin. The phosphorylated DNA damage-responsive kinase, ataxia telangiectasia mutated, was also found activated at sites of gamma-H2AX. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase, Chk2, was only weakly phosphorylated. Thus, batracylin is a dual Top1 and Top2 inhibitor and gamma-H2AX could be considered a biomarker in the ongoing clinical trials.","['Rao, V Ashutosh', 'Agama, Keli', 'Holbeck, Susan', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Rao VA', 'Agama K', 'Holbeck S', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '67199-66-0 (batracylin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded', '*DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Histones/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2007/10/19 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/20/9971 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0804 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Oct 15;67(20):9971-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0804.,,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) show activity in vitro and in preclinical models of both human and murine precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL), inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. These MTI-mediated effects can be reversed by interleukin-7 (IL-7), an important regulator of early B-cell development. This observation led us to examine the contribution of signaling via the IL-7Ralpha chain, which is shared by the receptor complexes of IL-7 and thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP is closely related to IL-7 and active in lymphopoiesis, but an effect of TSLP on leukemia cells has not been described. We examined the effect of TSLP on pre-B ALL cells and their response to MTIs. Here, we show that TSLP stimulates proliferation of pre-B ALL cell lines. TSLP also partially reverses the effects of MTI on proliferation, apoptosis, and ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in cell lines, with similar biological effects seen in some primary human lymphoblast samples. These data show that TSLP can promote survival of pre-B ALL cells and antagonize the effects of MTIs. These findings suggest that IL-7Ralpha chain is responsible for transducing the survival signal that overcomes MTI-mediated growth inhibition in pre-B ALL. Thus, further exploration of the IL-7Ralpha pathway may identify potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of ALL. Our data illustrate that growth-factor-mediated signaling may provide one mechanism of MTI resistance.","['Brown, Valerie I', 'Hulitt, Jessica', 'Fish, Jonathan', 'Sheen, Cecilia', 'Bruno, Marlo', 'Xu, Qing', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Fang, Junjie', 'Teachey, David', 'Grupp, Stephan A']","['Brown VI', 'Hulitt J', 'Fish J', 'Sheen C', 'Bruno M', 'Xu Q', 'Carroll M', 'Fang J', 'Teachey D', 'Grupp SA']","[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Eif4ebp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Protein S6)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'GT0IL38SP4 (thymic stromal lymphopoietin)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2007/10/19 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/20/9963 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4704 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Oct 15;67(20):9963-70. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4704.,,,,,"['K08 CA104882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA104882-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5K08-CA104882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNFalpha can exert opposing, concentration-dependent effects on neutrophils to either accelerate their apoptosis or enhance their survival. We show that TNFalpha greatly increases the rate of turnover of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein that plays a key role in neutrophil survival. In contrast to Mcl-1 turnover in control- or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-treated neutrophils that occurs via the proteasome, TNFalpha-accelerated Mcl-1 turnover occurs via activation of caspases. Mcl-1-depleted cells thus have accelerated rates of apoptosis. While TNFalpha had no effect on MCL-1 transcription, it induced expression of another antiapoptotic molecule, BFL-1. Low concentrations of TNFalpha (<or=1 ng/mL) stimulated BFL-1 expression, whereas higher concentrations (>or=10 ng/mL) triggered caspase-dependent acceleration of Mcl-1 turnover. These opposing effects on 2 separate antiapoptotic systems of neutrophils explain the divergent effects of TNFalpha on neutrophil apoptosis and have important implications for understanding how TNFalpha may affect immune function in inflammatory diseases.","['Cross, Andrew', 'Moots, Robert J', 'Edwards, Steven W']","['Cross A', 'Moots RJ', 'Edwards SW']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071017,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48508-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-087833 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):878-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-087833.

BLyS stimulation activates 2 independent signaling pathways, Akt/mTOR and Pim 2, associated with cell growth and survival. BLyS blocks the cell volume loss (atrophy) that freshly isolated B cells normally undergo when maintained in vitro while concurrently increasing glycolytic activity and overall metabolism. This atrophy resistance requires Akt/mTOR. We used a genetic approach to resolve the contributions of Akt/mTOR and Pim kinase pathways to BLyS-mediated survival. Pim 2-deficient B cells are readily protected from death by BLyS stimulation, but this protection is completely abrogated by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment in vivo significantly reduces both follicular and marginal zone B cells in Pim-deficient but not healthy hosts. BLyS-dependent survival requires the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. Mcl-1 protein levels rise and fall in response to BLyS addition and withdrawal, respectively, and conditional deletion of the Mcl-1 gene renders B cells refractory to BLyS-mediated protection. Because BlyS is required for the normal homeostasis of all B cells, these data suggest a therapeutic strategy simultaneously inhibiting mTOR and Pim 2 could target pathogenic B cells.","['Woodland, Robert T', 'Fox, Casey J', 'Schmidt, Madelyn R', 'Hammerman, Peter S', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley J', 'Hilbert, David M', 'Thompson, Craig B']","['Woodland RT', 'Fox CJ', 'Schmidt MR', 'Hammerman PS', 'Opferman JT', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Hilbert DM', 'Thompson CB']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655, USA.

Here, we show that histone H3-lysine 4 methylation, a chromatin mark associated with the transcriptional process, progressively increased at GAD1 and other GABAergic gene promoters (GAD2, NPY, SST) in human prefrontal cortex (PFC) from prenatal to peripubertal ages and throughout adulthood. Alterations in schizophrenia included decreased GAD1 expression and H3K4-trimethylation, predominantly in females and in conjunction with a risk haplotype at the 5' end of GAD1. Heterozygosity for a truncated, lacZ knock-in allele of mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1), a histone methyltransferase expressed in GABAergic and other cortical neurons, resulted in decreased H3K4 methylation at GABAergic gene promoters. In contrast, Gad1 H3K4 (tri)methylation and Mll1 occupancy was increased in cerebral cortex of mice after treatment with the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine. These effects were not mimicked by haloperidol or genetic ablation of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, suggesting that blockade of D2-like signaling is not sufficient for clozapine-induced histone methylation. Therefore, chromatin remodeling mechanisms at GABAergic gene promoters, including MLL1-mediated histone methylation, operate throughout an extended period of normal human PFC development and play a role in the neurobiology of schizophrenia.","['Huang, Hsien-Sung', 'Matevossian, Anouch', 'Whittle, Catheryne', 'Kim, Se Young', 'Schumacher, Armin', 'Baker, Stephen P', 'Akbarian, Schahram']","['Huang HS', 'Matevossian A', 'Whittle C', 'Kim SY', 'Schumacher A', 'Baker SP', 'Akbarian S']","['Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute, Department of Psychiatry, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 4.1.1.15 (Glutamate Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.15 (glutamate decarboxylase 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Glutamate Decarboxylase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Prefrontal Cortex/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Schizophrenia/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/genetics/*physiology']",2007/10/19 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['27/42/11254 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3272-07.2007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2007 Oct 17;27(42):11254-62. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3272-07.2007.,,,PMC6673022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Misregulation of Hox genes is likely to be critical for LSC induction and maintenance but alone it does not recapitulate the phenotype and biology of MLL leukemias, which are clinically heterogeneous--presumably reflecting differences in LSC biology and/or frequency. TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) class homeodomain proteins of the Pbx and Meis families are also misexpressed in this context, and we thus employed knockout, knockdown, and dominant-negative genetic techniques to investigate the requirements and contributions of these factors in MLL oncoprotein-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Our studies show that induction and maintenance of MLL transformation requires Meis1 and is codependent on the redundant contributions of Pbx2 and Pbx3. Meis1 in particular serves a major role in establishing LSC potential, and determines LSC frequency by quantitatively regulating the extent of self-renewal, differentiation arrest, and cycling, as well as the rate of in vivo LSC generation from myeloid progenitors. Thus, TALE proteins are critical downstream effectors within an essential homeoprotein network that serves a rate-limiting regulatory role in MLL leukemogenesis.","['Wong, Piu', 'Iwasaki, Masayuki', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'So, Chi Wai Eric', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Wong P', 'Iwasaki M', 'Somervaille TC', 'So CW', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071017,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tgif1 protein, mouse)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, cdc/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/mortality', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['gad.1602107 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1602107 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2007 Nov 1;21(21):2762-74. doi: 10.1101/gad.1602107.

The HTLV-1-encoded protein Tax transactivates the viral long terminal repeat and plays a critical role in virus replication and transformation. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that coactivator-associated arginine methytransferase 1, a protein arginine methytransferase, was important for Tax-mediated transactivation. To further investigate the role of methyltransferases in viral transcription, we utilized adenosine-2,3-dialdehyde (AdOx), an adenosine analog and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase inhibitor. The addition of AdOx decreased Tax transactivation in C81, Hut102, and MT-2 cells. Unexpectedly, we found that AdOx potently inhibited the growth of HTLV-1-transformed cells. Further investigation revealed that AdOx inhibited the Tax-activated NF-kappaB pathway, resulting in reactivation of p53 and induction of p53 target genes. Analysis of the NF-kappaB pathway demonstrated that AdOx treatment resulted in degradation of the IkappaB kinase complex and inhibition of NF-kappaB through stabilization of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha. Our data further demonstrated that AdOx induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and cell death in HTLV-1-transformed but not control lymphocytes.

In this report, we show that Friend virus induces the bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway in the spleen, which rapidly amplifies target cells, propagating their infection and resulting in acute splenomegaly. This mechanism mimics the response to acute anemia, in which BMP4 expressed in the spleen drives the expansion of a specialized population of stress erythroid progenitors. Previously we demonstrated that these progenitors, termed stress BFU-E, are targets for Friend virus in the spleen (A. Subramanian, H. E. Teal, P. H. Correll, and R. F. Paulson, J. Virol. 79:14586-14594, 2005). Here, we extend those findings by showing that Friend virus infects two distinct populations of bone marrow cells. One population, when infected, differentiates into mature erythrocytes in an Epo-independent manner, while a second population migrates to the spleen after infection, where it induces BMP4 expression and acts as a reservoir of virus. The activation of the stress erythropoiesis pathway in the spleen by Friend virus results in the rapid expansion of stress BFU-E, providing abundant target cells for viral infection. These observations suggest a novel mechanism by which a virus induces a stress response pathway that amplifies target cells for the virus, leading to acute expansion of infected cells.","['Subramanian, Aparna', 'Hegde, Shailaja', 'Porayette, Prashanth', 'Yon, Michele', 'Hankey, Pamela', 'Paulson, Robert F']","['Subramanian A', 'Hegde S', 'Porayette P', 'Yon M', 'Hankey P', 'Paulson RF']","['Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071017,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/virology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Spleen/pathology/virology', 'Splenomegaly/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02487-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02487-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jan;82(1):382-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02487-06.

Recent studies demonstrated that individual ND10 components, like hDaxx or promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), mediate an intrinsic immune response against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, strengthening the assumption that ND10 components are part of a cellular antiviral defense mechanism. In order to further define the role of hDaxx and PML for HCMV replication, we generated either primary human fibroblasts with a stable, individual knockdown of PML or hDaxx (PML-kd and hDaxx-kd, respectively) or cells exhibiting a double knockdown. Comparative analysis of HCMV replication in PML-kd or hDaxx-kd cells revealed that immediate-early (IE) gene expression increased to a similar extent, regardless of which ND10 constituent was depleted. Since a loss of PML, the defining component of ND10, results in a dispersal of the entire nuclear substructure, the increased replication efficacy of HCMV in PML-kd cells could be a consequence of the dissociation of the repressor protein hDaxx from its optimal subnuclear localization. However, experiments using three different recombinant HCMVs revealed a differential growth complementation in PML-kd versus hDaxx-kd cells, strongly arguing for an independent involvement in suppressing HCMV replication. Furthermore, infection experiments using double-knockdown cells devoid of both PML and hDaxx illustrated an additional enhancement in the replication efficacy of HCMV compared to the single-knockdown cells. Taken together, our data indicate that both proteins, PML and hDaxx, mediate an intrinsic immune response against HCMV infection by contributing independently to the silencing of HCMV IE gene expression.","['Tavalai, Nina', 'Papior, Peer', 'Rechter, Sabine', 'Stamminger, Thomas']","['Tavalai N', 'Papior P', 'Rechter S', 'Stamminger T']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, University Hospital Erlangen, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071017,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', '*Virus Replication']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01685-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01685-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jan;82(1):126-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01685-07.

However, the type of polyubiquitin chain linkages and the host factors that are required for Tax ubiquitination have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that Tax polyubiquitin chains are composed predominantly of lysine 63-linked chains. Furthermore, the ubiquitination of Tax is critically dependent on the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13. Tax interacts with Ubc13, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Ubc13 expression abrogates Tax ubiquitination and the activation of NF-kappaB. Mouse fibroblasts lacking Ubc13 exhibit impaired Tax activation of NF-kappaB despite normal tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Finally, the interaction of Tax with NEMO is disrupted in the absence of Tax ubiquitination and Ubc13 expression, suggesting that Tax ubiquitination is critical for NEMO binding. Collectively, our results reveal that Ubc13 is essential for Tax ubiquitination, its interaction with NEMO, and Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activation.","['Shembade, Noula', 'Harhaj, Nicole S', 'Yamamoto, Masahiro', 'Akira, Shizuo', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Shembade N', 'Harhaj NS', 'Yamamoto M', 'Akira S', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, the University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, 1550 NW 10 Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071017,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (IKBKG protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ube2n protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/10/19 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01790-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01790-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Dec;81(24):13735-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01790-07.

The development of human or chimeric antibodies and protein engineering to combine MoAbs with other biologically active molecules, such as radio-isotopes, toxins, chemotherapy and cytokines, has made available a new range of agents with clinical activity. DISCUSSION: This article will review the requirements and strategies for successful MoAb therapy and the clinical experience in a range of lymphoid malignancies. On the basis of substantial experience of antibodies, such as rituximab and alemtuzumab, as single agents, there is now evidence from randomized trials that the addition of antibodies to chemotherapy improves efficacy and prolongs progression free and overall survival for patients with follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. CONCLUSION: The trials of the next decade will address issues such as the optimal strategies and timing for clinical use, the role of radio- and immuno-conjugates and, finally, what other potential molecules, such as those influencing cell growth and death, may be targeted.","['Dearden, Claire E']",['Dearden CE'],"['The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Downs Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5 PT UK. claire.dearden@rmh.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Br Med Bull,British medical bulletin,0376542,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Rituximab']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/05/15 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['83/1/275 [pii]', '10.1093/bmb/ldm025 [doi]']",ppublish,Br Med Bull. 2007;83:275-90. doi: 10.1093/bmb/ldm025.,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gain-of-function Shp2 mutants such as Shp2E76K are associated with myeloid leukemias. We found that Shp2E76K could transform cytokine-dependent human TF-1 myeloid cells into cytokine independence and further characterized the Shp2E76K-induced cell survival mechanism in this study. Expression of Shp2E76K suppressed the cytokine withdrawal-induced intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which is controlled by the Bcl-2 family proteins. Analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins showed that Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were up-regulated in Shp2E76K-transformed TF-1 (TF-1/Shp2E76K) cells. Knockdown of Bcl-XL but not Mcl-1 with short hairpin RNAs prevented Shp2E76K-induced cytokine-independent survival. Roscovitine, which down-regulated Mcl-1, also did not prevent cytokine-independent survival of TF-1/Shp2E76K cells, whereas the Bcl-XL inhibitor HA14-1 did. Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2 (Erk1/2) were constitutively activated in TF-1/Shp2E76K cells, whereas little active Akt was detected under cytokine-free conditions. Shp2E76K-induced Bcl-XL expression was suppressed by Mek inhibitors and by a dominant-negative Mek1 mutant but not by the phosphoinositide 3-phosphate inhibitor LY294002 and the Akt inhibitor API-2. Inhibition of Erk1/2 blocked cytokine-independent survival of TF-1/Shp2E76K cells, whereas inhibition of Akt had a minimal effect on cytokine-independent survival of TF-1/Shp2E76K cells. These results show that Shp2E76K can evoke constitutive Erk1/2 activation in TF-1 cells. Furthermore, Shp2E76K induces cytokine-independent survival of TF-1 cells by a novel mechanism involving up-regulation of Bcl-XL through the Erk1/2 pathway.","['Ren, Yuan', 'Chen, Zhengming', 'Chen, Liwei', 'Woods, Nicholas T', 'Reuther, Gary W', 'Cheng, Jin Q', 'Wang, Hong-gang', 'Wu, Jie']","['Ren Y', 'Chen Z', 'Chen L', 'Woods NT', 'Reuther GW', 'Cheng JQ', 'Wang HG', 'Wu J']","['Molecular Oncology Program, H.

Age-standardized to the 2000 US population, overall IRs were 3.83 per 100 000 person-years for CLL (n = 15 676) and 1.31 for SLL (n = 5382) during 1993-2004. Incidence of the combined entity, CLL/SLL, was 90% higher among males compared to females, and the male:female IR ratio was significantly higher for CLL (1.98) than for SLL (1.67). CLL/SLL IRs were 25% and 77% lower among Blacks and Asian/Pacific Islanders, respectively, compared to Whites. A significant reporting delay was evident for CLL but not for SLL, so that CLL/SLL temporal trends must be interpreted cautiously. CLL and SLL IRs increased exponentially with age among all gender/race groups, with CLL IRs increasing more steeply with advancing age than SLL.

The New Zealand Black (NZB) strain is a naturally occurring model of late-onset CLL characterized by B-cell hyperproliferation and autoimmunity early in life, followed by progression to CLL. Other genetically engineered models of CLL that have been developed include (NZB x NZW) F1 mice engineered to express IL5, mice expressing human TCL1A, and mice overexpressing both BCL2 and a tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor. The applicability to human CLL varies with each model, suggesting that CLL is a multifactorial disease. Our work with the de novo NZB model has revealed many similarities to the human situation, particularly familial CLL. In NZB, the malignant clones express CD5, zap-70, and have chromosomal instability and germline Ig sequence. We also identified a point mutation in the 3'-flanking sequence of Mirn16-1, which resulted in decreased levels of the microRNA, miR-16 in lymphoid tissue. Exogenous restoration of miR-16 to an NZB malignant B-1 cell line resulted in cell cycle alterations, suggesting that the altered expression of Mirn15a/16-1 is an important molecular lesion in CLL. Future studies utilizing the NZB mouse could ascertain the role of environmental triggers, such as low dose radiation and organic chemicals in the augmentation of a pre-existing propensity to develop CLL.","['Scaglione, Brian J', 'Salerno, Erica', 'Balan, Murugabaskar', 'Coffman, Frederick', 'Landgraf, Pablo', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Kotenko, Sergei', 'Marti, Gerald E', 'Raveche, Elizabeth S']","['Scaglione BJ', 'Salerno E', 'Balan M', 'Coffman F', 'Landgraf P', 'Abbasi F', 'Kotenko S', 'Marti GE', 'Raveche ES']","['New Jersey Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071017,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6851 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06851.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Dec;139(5):645-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06851.x.

Combretastatin A-1 (CA1) has a greater antitumor effect than combretastatin A-4 (CA4). We hypothesized that this reflects the enhanced reactivity conferred by the second (ortho) phenolic moiety in CA1. Oxidation of CA1 by peroxidase, tyrosinase, or Fe(III) generates a species with mass characteristics of the corresponding ortho-quinone Q1. After administration of CA1-bis(phosphate) to mice, the hydroquinone-thioether conjugate Q1H2-SG, formed from the nucleophilic addition of GSH to Q1, was detected in liver. In competition, electrocyclic ring closure of Q1, over a few minutes at pH 7.4, leads to a second ortho-quinone product Q2, characterized by exact mass and NMR. This product was also generated by human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells in vitro, provided that superoxide dismutase was added. Q2 is highly reactive toward glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate, stimulating oxygen consumption in a catalytic manner. Free radical intermediates formed during autoxidation of CA1 were characterized by EPR, and the effects of GSH and ascorbate on the signals were studied. Pulse radiolysis was used to initiate selective one-electron oxidation or reduction and provided further evidence, from the differing absorption spectra of the radicals formed on oxidation of CA1 or reduction of Q2, that two different quinones were formed on oxidation of CA1. The results demonstrate fundamental differences between the pharmacological properties of CA1 and CA4 that provide two possible explanations for their differential activities in vivo: oxidative activation to a quinone intermediate likely to bind to protein thiols and possibly to nucleic acids and stimulation of oxidative stress by enhancing superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production. The observation of the GSH conjugate Q1H2-SG in vivo provides a new marker for oxidative metabolism of relevance to current clinical trials of CA1-bis(phosphate) (OXi4503).","['Folkes, Lisa K', 'Christlieb, Martin', 'Madej, Edyta', 'Stratford, Michael R L', 'Wardman, Peter']","['Folkes LK', 'Christlieb M', 'Madej E', 'Stratford MR', 'Wardman P']","['University of Oxford, Gray Cancer Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital, Middlesex, UK. folkes@gci.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071018,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '2222ATS339 (combretastatin A-1)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Free Radicals/*metabolism', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Detoxication, Phase I', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Nucleic Acids/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Protein Binding', 'Quinones/*metabolism', 'Stilbenes/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism']",2007/10/19 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx7002195 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2007 Dec;20(12):1885-94. doi: 10.1021/tx7002195.

Of the 11 patients who achieved CR, 9 received consolidation therapy. The median survival was 11.2 months, and the median of event-free survival and overall survival in the patients who achieved CR was 9.4 months and 21.6 months, respectively.

Following activation, the TM undergoes conformational transitions from a native nonfusogenic state to a fusion-active pre-hairpin intermediate that subsequently resolves to a compact trimer-of-hairpins or six-helix bundle. Disruption of these structural transitions inhibits membrane fusion and viral entry and validates TM as an anti-viral and vaccine target. To investigate the immunological properties of fusion-active TM, we have generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize the coiled-coil domain of the pre-hairpin intermediate. Antibody reactivity is highly sensitive to the conformation of the coiled coil as binding is dramatically reduced or lost on denatured antigen. Moreover, a unique group of antibodies are 100-1000-fold more reactive with the coiled coil than the trimer-of-hairpins form of TM. The antibodies recognize virally expressed envelope, and significantly, some selectively bind to envelope only under conditions that promote membrane fusion. Most importantly, many of the antibodies potently block six-helix bundle formation in vitro. Nevertheless, viral envelope was remarkably resistant to neutralization by antibodies directed to the coiled coil. The data imply that the coiled coil of viral envelope is poorly exposed to antibody during membrane fusion. We suggest that resistance to neutralization by antibodies directed to fusion-associated structures is a common property of retroviral TM and perhaps of other viral class I fusion proteins. These observations have significant implications for vaccine design.","['Mirsaliotis, Antonis', 'Nurkiyanova, Kulpash', 'Lamb, Daniel', 'Kuo, Chien-Wen S', 'Brighty, David W']","['Mirsaliotis A', 'Nurkiyanova K', 'Lamb D', 'Kuo CW', 'Brighty DW']","['Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, the University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071016,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/genetics/immunology', '*Virus Internalization']",2007/10/18 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/10/18 09:00'],"['2007/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(18)46126-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M706827200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Dec 14;282(50):36724-35. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M706827200.

By inhibiting RUNX function, the fusion oncoprotein predisposes specifically to acute myeloid leukemia in both patients and mouse models. We have shown that Cbfbeta-SMMHC expression leads to a sustained reduction of circulating B lymphocytes in the mouse. In this study, we demonstrate that the activation of Cbfbeta-SMMHC reduces pre-pro-B cells approximately 3-fold and pre-B cells more than 10-fold and that this differentiation block is cell-autonomous. The reduction of pre-pro-B cells coincided with an increase in apoptosis in this population. The number of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) were not affected; however, the expression of critical early B-cell factors Ebf1, Tcfe2a, and Pax5 was significantly reduced. In addition, Cbfbeta-SMMHC reduced Rag1 and Rag2 expression and impaired V(D)J recombination in the CLPs. Furthermore, CLPs expressing Cbfbeta-SMMHC also show inhibition of B cell-specific genes Cd79a, Igll1, VpreB1, and Blk. These results demonstrate that CBF/RUNX function is essential for the function of CLPs, the survival of pre-pro-B cells, and the establishment of a B lineage-specific transcriptional program. This study also provides a mechanistic basis for the myeloid-lineage bias of CBFbeta-SMMHC-associated leukemia.","['Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Gerstein, Rachel M', 'Castilla, Lucio H']","['Kuo YH', 'Gerstein RM', 'Castilla LH']","['Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071016,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'VDJ Recombinases/genetics/metabolism']",2007/10/18 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/10/18 09:00'],"['2007/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45411-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-104422 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1543-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-104422.

After excluding patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplications, we compared treatment outcome of 16 de novo CN-AML patients with FLT3-TKD with that of 123 patients with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), less than 60 years of age and similarly treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols. All FLT3-TKD(+) patients and 85% of FLT3-WT patients achieved a complete remission (P = .13). Disease-free survival (DFS) of FLT3-TKD(+) patients was worse than DFS of FLT3-WT patients (P = .01; estimated 3-year DFS rates, 31% vs 60%, respectively). In a multivariable analysis, FLT3-TKD was associated with worse DFS (P = .02) independent of NPM1 status and percentage of bone marrow blasts. To gain further biologic insights, a gene-expression signature differentiating FLT3-TKD(+) from FLT3-WT patients was identified. The signature (333 probe sets) included overexpression of VNN1, C3AR1, PTPN6, and multiple other genes involved in monocarboxylate transport activity, and underexpression of genes involved in signal transduction regulation. These associations with outcome, other prognostic markers, and the elucidated expression signature enhance our understanding of FLT3-TKD-associated biology and may lead to development of novel therapies that improve clinical outcome of CN-AML patients with FLT3-TKD.","['Whitman, Susan P', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Langer, Christian', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Wen, Jing', 'Racke, Frederick', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Whitman SP', 'Ruppert AS', 'Radmacher MD', 'Mrozek K', 'Paschka P', 'Langer C', 'Baldus CD', 'Wen J', 'Racke F', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Larson RA', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43240, USA. susan.whitman@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071016,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspartic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoleucine/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/10/18 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/10/18 09:00'],"['2007/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45412-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-107946 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 1;111(3):1552-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-107946.

WT1 is a well-characterized developmental gene that is mutated in Wilms' tumor (WT) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and has an antisense transcript (WT1-AS), which we have previously found to regulate WT1 protein levels. In this study, we show that WT1-AS is present in multiple spliceoforms that are usually expressed in parallel with WT1 RNA in human and mouse tissues. We demonstrate that the expression of WT1-AS correlates with methylation of the antisense regulatory region (ARR) in WT1 intron 1, displaying imprinted monoallelic expression in normal kidney and loss of imprinting in WT. However, we find no evidence for imprinting of mouse Wt1-as. WT1-AS transcripts are exported into the cytoplasm and form heteroduplexes with WT1 mRNA in the overlapping region in WT1 exon 1. In AML, there is often abnormal splicing of WT1-AS, which may play a role in the development of this malignancy.

Two conclusions have been drawn from previous studies. One suggests that colostrum ingestion transmits BLV to neonatal calves. The second suggests that colostral antibodies are protective. HYPOTHESIS: Colostrum from BLV-positive cattle is protective in naturally exposed calves. ANIMALS: Twelve colostrum-deprived Holstein calves and 20 colostrum-fed Holstein calves born to BLV-infected cows. METHODS: Prospective study. Colostrum-deprived calves were tested weekly by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for BLV antibody and provirus for 12 weeks or until the animal became positive for BLV infection. Colostrum-fed calves were fed colostrum derived from BLV-positive cows. Thereafter, ELISA and PCR tests for BLV antibody and provirus were performed every other week until 2 consecutive negative ELISA tests or 1 positive PCR test was achieved. The proportion of calves that converted to BLV-positive status was calculated for each group and compared between groups by using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Four of 12 colostrum-deprived calves (33%) became BLV positive, whereas 0 of 20 colostrum-fed calves (0%) became BLV positive. The proportion of calves that became infected was significantly higher in the colostrum-deprived group (P = .014). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Calves born to BLV-positive cows are exposed during parturition, and a proportion of these calves will become infected with BLV. Administration of colostrum from BLV-positive cows greatly decreases the risk of infection.","['Nagy, Dusty W', 'Tyler, Jeff W', 'Kleiboeker, Steven B']","['Nagy DW', 'Tyler JW', 'Kleiboeker SB']","['Departments of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO 65211, USA. nagyd@missouri.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'Colostrum/*immunology/virology', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/*transmission/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Incidence', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics']",2007/10/18 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/10/18 09:00'],"['2007/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1892/0891-6640(2007)21[1104:dptobl]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2007 Sep-Oct;21(5):1104-7. doi: 10.1892/0891-6640(2007)21[1104:dptobl]2.0.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A complete blood count (CBC) revealed peripheral lymphocytosis. Abdominal ultrasonography and laparoscopy confirmed severe splenomegaly. Cytologic examination of a bone-marrow core and histologic examination of spleen and liver biopsy samples revealed neoplastic small lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical staining of liver and spleen samples with the use of leukocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies showed that the neoplastic lymphocytes were immunoreactive to T-lymphocyte CD3 receptor and immunonegative to B-lymphocyte CD79a receptor. The morphology and distribution of neoplastic T-lymphocytes within the spleen, liver, peripheral blood, and bone marrow was most consistent with chronic T-lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment with chlorambucil and prednisone effectively decreased the lymphocyte count, but was associated with thrombocytopenia, which resolved after chlorambucil treatment was temporarily discontinued. Chemotherapy was resumed with a single dose of L-asparaginase, followed by a lower dosage of chlorambucil and continued prednisone. Two years after initial diagnosis, the hyena developed a hemoabdomen and was euthanized.

Disease outbreaks in small populations have probably led to the eventual extinction of such endangered animals in the wild. The endangered Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) population may also face such threats. This was evident from this study on captive Asiatic lions from western India, which were sampled from December 1998 to March 1999. Fifty-six Asiatic lions, including 17 hybrid lions (Afro-Asian crosses) from six captive centers in western India, were tested for antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV), feline parvovirus (FPV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline leukemia viral (FeLV) antigen. Agar gel immunodiffusion test and dot immunobinding assay were employed for CDV and FPV antibody detection. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used for FIV antibody and FeLV antigen detection. Forty-nine of 56 lions (87.5%) were positive for CDV. All 56 (100%) lions were positive for FPV antibodies. There were no detectable levels of FIV antibodies and FeLV antigens. It was observed that CDV and FPV, two viruses known to cause high mortality in captive carnivores, were widely prevalent in these captive Asiatic lions. It is suggested that these seropositive animals will have the potential to pose a risk of infection to other seronegative animals. Hence, it is imperative to carefully consider any movement, translocation, or reintroduction of these animals to new regions. It is also recommended that these animals be required to undergo standard quarantine and disease screening protocols. The lack of exposure to pathogens, such as FIV and FeLV, would also be a risk, and, hence, identification of reservoirs and screening of in-contact animals is highly recommended. Vaccinations must be considered, using killed or other suitable viral vaccines, which have been proved to be safe, effective, and efficacious in endangered felids.","['Ramanathan, Anand', 'Malik, Pradeep K', 'Prasad, Gaya']","['Ramanathan A', 'Malik PK', 'Prasad G']","['Wildlife Institute of India, P.O.

The most convincing proof is found in acute myeloid leukemia, where only a small subset of slowly dividing cells was able to induce transplantable acute myeloid leukemia. Normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are characterized by their unlimited ability to self-renew, give rise to a multitude of cells that exhibit more differentiated features, and show slow division kinetics. Using human HSC and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) as models, we and others have demonstrated the vital role of the cellular niche in maintaining the self-renewing capacity, that is, ""stemness"" of HSC. Without direct contact with the cellular niche, HSC tend to differentiate and lose their stemness. Similar to their normal counterparts, leukemia stem cells divide slowly and maintain their self-renewal capacity through interaction with the niche. As a consequence, they are resistant to conventional chemotherapy strategies that target rapidly dividing cells. Thus it is of utmost importance to understand the interaction between cellular niche and normal HSC as well as between leukemia stem cells and the niche to provide a basis for more efficient treatment strategies.","['Ho, A D', 'Wagner, W']","['Ho AD', 'Wagner W']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. anthony-dick.ho@urz.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Ernst Schering Found Symp Proc,Ernst Schering Foundation symposium proceedings,101312605,['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2007/10/18 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/10/18 09:00'],"['2007/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/2789_2007_048 [doi]'],ppublish,Ernst Schering Found Symp Proc. 2006;(5):125-39. doi: 10.1007/2789_2007_048.,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several growth factors contribute to enlarging the PGC population by acting as mitogens, survival factors or both. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has a growth-promoting activity for T and B-lymphocytes, but its role in PGCs had not yet been studied. Here, we show that PGCs isolated from 10.5, 11.5 and 12.5 day postcoitum (dpc) mouse embryos constitutively express the three subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). In contrast, IL-2 mRNA was not detected in these cells. However, the addition of recombinant IL-2 to the culture medium increased the number of PGCs in vitro via a mitogenic effect, as indicated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays. Neutralization of the IL-2 receptor using anti-IL-2R subunit antibodies inhibited this IL-2-mediated proliferative effect on PGCs from 11.5 dpc embryos. Together, these data are indicative of a paracrine effect of IL-2 on PGC proliferation. In this regard, we also compared the effect of IL-2 with other compounds such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), steel factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and forskolin, and found that the degree of proliferation induced by IL-2 was similar to that induced by bFGF and forskolin. These observations support the notion that similar patterns of molecular signaling may underlie the developmental pathways of hematopoietic and germ stem cell precursors.","['Eguizabal, Cristina', 'Boyano, Maria D', 'Diez-Torre, Alejandro', 'Andrade, Ricardo', 'Andollo, Noelia', 'De Felici, Massimo', 'Arechaga, Juan']","['Eguizabal C', 'Boyano MD', 'Diez-Torre A', 'Andrade R', 'Andollo N', 'De Felici M', 'Arechaga J']","['Laboratory of Developmental Biology and Cancer, Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country, Vizcaya, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Germ Cells/*cytology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spermatogonia/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2007/10/17 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/10/17 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['072442ce [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.072442ce [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2007;51(8):731-8. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.072442ce.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 2001, the detection of the high frequency of the JAK2V617F mutation in PV, CIMF, and ET, and of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in CEL further added important information in the diagnosis of CMPD. These findings also enhanced the importance of tyrosine kinase mutations in CMPD and paved the way to a more detailed classification and to an improved definition of prognosis using also novel minimal residual disease (MRD) markers. Simultaneously, the broadening of therapeutic strategies in the CMPD, e.g., due to reduced intensity conditioning in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML, in CEL, and in other ABL and PDGRFB rearrangements, increased the demands to diagnostics. Therefore, today, a multimodal diagnostic approach combining cytomorphology, cytogenetics, and individual molecular methods is needed in BCR/ABL-negative CMPD.

Inhalation of FA induces sensory irritation at relatively low concentrations. However, little is known concerning the cellular alterations observed after FA exposure in humans. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to profile global gene expression in Hs 680.Tr human tracheal fibroblasts exposed to FA and to develop biomarkers for the evaluation of FA exposure in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used gene expression analysis, and identified 54 genes designated as FA responsive. On the basis of these data, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the expression of these genes in human subjects exposed to high or low levels of FA. We monitored FA exposure by measuring the urinary concentration of thiazolidine-4-carboxylate (TZCA), a stable and quantitative cysteinyl adduct of FA. Nine genes were selected for real-time PCR analysis; of these, BHLHB2, CCNL1, SE20-4, C8FW, PLK2, and SGK showed elevated expression in subjects with high concentrations of TZCA. CONCLUSION: The identification of gene marker candidates in vitro using microarray analysis and their validation using human samples obtained from exposed subjects is a good tool for discovering genes of potential mechanistic interest and biomarkers of exposure. Thus, these genes are differentially expressed in response to FA and are potential effect biomarkers of FA exposure.","['Li, Guang-Yong', 'Lee, Hye-Young', 'Shin, Ho-Sang', 'Kim, Hyeon-Young', 'Lim, Cheol-Hong', 'Lee, Byung-Hoon']","['Li GY', 'Lee HY', 'Shin HS', 'Kim HY', 'Lim CH', 'Lee BH']","['College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (BHLHE40 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (C8G protein, human)', '0 (CCNL1 protein, human)', '0 (Complement C8)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TSPYL2 protein, human)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', 'E5913T3IBL (thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (serum-glucocorticoid regulated kinase)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/drug effects/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C8/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclins/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Homeodomain Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/genetics', 'Thiazolidines/urine']",2007/10/17 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/10/17 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.10180 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Oct;115(10):1460-6. doi: 10.1289/ehp.10180.,,,PMC2022670,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarker', 'carcinogenesis', 'formaldehyde', 'human study', 'microarray', 'toxicogenomics']",,,,,,

GC also form in T-independent (TI) responses to polysaccharide antigens but failed selection results in GC involution and memory cells are not generated. To date there are no markers that allow phenotypic distinction of T-dependent and TI germinal centre B cells. We compared the global gene expression of GC B cells purified from mice immunized with either TD or TI antigens and identified eighty genes that are differentially expressed in TD GC. Significantly, the largest cluster comprises genes involved in growth and guidance of neuron axons such as Plexin B2, Basp1, Nelf, Shh, Sc4mol and Sult4alpha. This is consistent with formation of long neurite (axon and dendrite)-like structures by mouse and human GC B cells, which may facilitate T:B cell interactions within GC, affinity maturation and B cell memory formation. Expression of BASP1 and PLEXIN B2 protein is very low or undetectable in resting and TI GC B cells, but markedly upregulated in GC B cells induced in the presence of T cell help. Finally we show some of the axon growth genes upregulated in TD-GC B cells including Basp1, Shh, Sult4alpha, Sc4mol are also preferentially expressed in post-GC B cell neoplasms.","['Yu, Di', 'Cook, Matthew C', 'Shin, Dong-Mi', 'Silva, Diego G', 'Marshall, Jennifer', 'Toellner, Kai-Michael', 'Havran, Wendy L', 'Caroni, Pico', 'Cooke, Michael P', 'Morse, Herbert C', 'MacLennan, Ian C M', 'Goodnow, Christopher C', 'Vinuesa, Carola G']","['Yu D', 'Cook MC', 'Shin DM', 'Silva DG', 'Marshall J', 'Toellner KM', 'Havran WL', 'Caroni P', 'Cooke MP', 'Morse HC', 'MacLennan IC', 'Goodnow CC', 'Vinuesa CG']","['Division of Immunology and Genetics, John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071016,United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antigens, T-Independent)', '0 (Basp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Plxnb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Shh protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (negative elongation factor)', 'EC 2.8.2 (SULT4A1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (Sulfotransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, T-Independent/*genetics/immunology', 'Axons/physiology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Germinal Center/cytology/*immunology', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Organ Specificity', 'Sulfotransferases', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology']",2007/10/17 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2007/10/17 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7100123 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.icb.7100123 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2008 Jan;86(1):3-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.icb.7100123.

To evaluate the possibility of second primary tumors after radioactive iodine treatment, we reviewed the reports on risks from both external and internal radiation exposure, especially at high doses during childhood through an internet service of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, PubMed by the end of June, 2007, together with our own experience of Chernobyl childhood thyroid cancers. Children who were internally exposed after Chernobyl accident have a long-term risk of well differentiated thyroid cancers. Once they have disease, ironically radioactive iodine ablation is one of the useful therapies after surgical treatment. Elevated risks of solid cancers and leukemia have been found in radioiodine-treated patients, however, so far precious few reports from Chernobyl thyroid cancer patient were published. To reduce the adverse effects of radioactive iodine therapy on non-target tissues, recombinant human TSH has been applied and proved effective. Period of latency of second primary cancers may be very long. Therefore patients treated with high activities of radioactive iodine, especially children cases, should be carefully followed up during their whole lifespan.","['Kumagai, Atsushi', 'Reiners, Christoph', 'Drozd, Valentina', 'Yamashita, Shunichi']","['Kumagai A', 'Reiners C', 'Drozd V', 'Yamashita S']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20071015,Japan,Endocr J,Endocrine journal,9313485,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/prevention & control/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Assessment', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Thyrotropin/pharmacology', 'Thyroxine/pharmacology']",2007/10/17 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2007/10/17 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/endocrj/K07E-012 [pii]', '10.1507/endocrj.k07e-012 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr J. 2007 Dec;54(6):839-47. doi: 10.1507/endocrj.k07e-012.

Here, we investigated the effect of IL-15 and IL-21, which are closely related to IL-2 and share the usage of the common gamma chain and of its JAK3-associated pathway. We found remarkable differences in the signal transduction pathways activated by these cytokines, which determined different responses in CLL cells. IL-15 caused cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis induced by surface IgM cross-linking. These effects were more evident in cells stimulated via surface CD40, which exhibited increased cell expression of IL-15Ralpha chain and, in some of the cases, also of IL-2Rbeta. IL-21 failed to induce CLL cell proliferation and instead promoted apoptosis. Following cell exposure to IL-15, phosphorylation of STAT5 was predominantly observed, whereas, following stimulation with IL-21, there was predominant STAT1 and STAT3 activation. Moreover, IL-15 but not IL-21 caused an increased phosphorylation of Shc and ERK1/2. Pharmacological inhibition of JAK3 or of MEK, which phosphorylates ERK1/2, efficiently blocked IL-15-induced CLL cell proliferation and the antiapoptotic effect of this cytokine. The knowledge of the signaling pathways regulating CLL cell survival and proliferation may provide new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.","['de Totero, Daniela', 'Meazza, Raffaella', 'Capaia, Matteo', 'Fabbi, Marina', 'Azzarone, Bruno', 'Balleari, Enrico', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Ferrini, Silvano']","['de Totero D', 'Meazza R', 'Capaia M', 'Fabbi M', 'Azzarone B', 'Balleari E', 'Gobbi M', 'Cutrona G', 'Ferrarini M', 'Ferrini S']","['Department of Translational Oncology and Medical Oncology C, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071015,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (IL2RB protein, human)', '0 (Il15ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Il2rb protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/immunology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunologic Capping/drug effects/immunology', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit/immunology', 'Interleukins/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 3/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/immunology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15/immunology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1']",2007/10/17 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/17 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48464-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-087882 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):517-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-087882.

METHODS: In total, 293 patients diagnosed with WG between 1973 and 1999 were studied. Cancer incidence in the cohort was assessed through 2003 by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry and compared to that of the general population by calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Analyses were stratified according to treatment with low cumulative CYC doses (< or = 36 g) and high doses (> 36 g, corresponding to treatment with 100 mg CYC/day for > 1 year). RESULTS: Fifty cancers occurred during 2121 person-years of followup (SIR of cancer of 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-2.7). Significantly increased SIR were observed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; SIR 19.6, 95% CI 4.0-57), bladder cancer (SIR 3.6, 95% CI 1.2-8.3), and non-melanoma skin cancers (SIR 4.7, 95% CI 2.8-7.3). Leukemias and bladder cancers were diagnosed 6.9-18.5 years after initiation of CYC therapy. The risk of these malignancies was not increased for patients who never received CYC or for patients treated with cumulative CYC doses < or = 36 g. In contrast, high risks of AML (SIR 59.0, 95% CI 12-172) and bladder cancer (SIR 9.5, 95% CI 2.6-24) were observed for patients treated with cumulative CYC doses > 36 g. CONCLUSION: Treatment with high cumulative CYC doses implies a substantial risk of late-occurring, serious malignancies in WG. Patients with WG should be monitored for development of cancer for several decades after cessation of CYC therapy. These findings emphasize the need for development of new treatment regimens in WG.","['Faurschou, Mikkel', 'Sorensen, Inge Juul', 'Mellemkjaer, Lene', 'Loft, Anne Gitte Rasmussen', 'Thomsen, Bjarne Svalgaard', 'Tvede, Niels', 'Baslund, Bo']","['Faurschou M', 'Sorensen IJ', 'Mellemkjaer L', 'Loft AG', 'Thomsen BS', 'Tvede N', 'Baslund B']","['Department of Rheumatology, The National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071015,Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology']",2007/10/17 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/17 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['07/13/1022 [pii]'],ppublish,J Rheumatol. 2008 Jan;35(1):100-5.

Here we show that Jurkat and CCRF-CEM human T-leukemia cell lines were more sensitive than normal human T cells to the cytotoxic effect of inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid (OA) caused T-leukemia cells to die by apoptosis, as indicated by DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and changes in nuclear morphology that were consistent with apoptosis. PP2A might therefore be a useful intracellular target for the treatment of T cell-derived leukemias. We also observed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in response to PP2A inhibition in T-leukemia cells. However, loss of DeltaPsi(m) that resulted from PP2A inhibition was not prevented by exogenous antioxidants (glutathione and N-acetyl-cysteine), indicating that OA-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability were not a consequence of ROS production. Moreover, exogenous antioxidants protected CCRF-CEM T-leukemia cells from apoptosis caused by PP2A inhibition but failed to prevent OA-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, indicating a differential role for ROS in apoptosis caused by PP2A inhibition in two different human T-leukemia cell lines.","['Boudreau, Robert T M', 'Conrad, David M', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Boudreau RT', 'Conrad DM', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada B3H 1X5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071002,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Okadaic Acid/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2007/10/16 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(07)00119-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2007 Dec;83(3):347-56. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.09.003.

One regulatory network known to control hemocyte differentiation is the Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signal-transduction pathway. A constitutive activation mutation of the Janus kinase Hopscotch (hopscotch(Tumorous-lethal); hop(Tum-l)) results in a leukemia-like over-proliferation of hemocytes and copious differentiation of lamellocytes during larval stages. Here we show that the Friend of GATA (FOG) protein U-shaped (Ush) is expressed in circulating and lymph gland hemocytes, where it plays a critical role in controlling blood cell proliferation and differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that a reduction in ush function results in hematopoietic phenotypes strikingly similar to those observed in hop(Tum-l) animals. These include lymph gland hypertrophy, increased circulating hemocyte concentration, and abundant production of lamellocytes. Forced expression of N-terminal truncated versions of Ush likewise leads to larvae with severe hematopoietic anomalies. In contrast, expression of wild-type Ush results in a strong suppression of hop(Tum-l) phenotypes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that U-shaped acts to control larval hemocyte proliferation and suppress lamellocyte differentiation, likely regulating hematopoietic events downstream of Hop kinase activity. Such functions appear to be facilitated through Ush interaction with the hematopoietic GATA factor Serpent (Srp).","['Sorrentino, Richard Paul', 'Tokusumi, Tsuyoshi', 'Schulz, Robert A']","['Sorrentino RP', 'Tokusumi T', 'Schulz RA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas M.

To further examine the features of inner ear-derived neural stem cells and their derivatives, we investigated the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a neurokine that has been shown to promote self-renewal of other neural stem cells and to affect neural and glial cell differentiation. RESULTS: LIF-treatment led to a dose-dependent increase of the number of neurons and glial cells in cultures of sphere-derived cells. Based on the detection of developmental and progenitor cell markers that are maintained in LIF-treated cultures and the increase of cycling nestin-positive progenitors, we propose that LIF maintains a pool of neural progenitor cells. We further provide evidence that LIF increases the number of nestin-positive progenitor cells directly in a cell cycle-independent fashion, which we interpret as an acceleration of neurogenesis in sphere-derived progenitors. This effect is further enhanced by an anti-apoptotic action of LIF. Finally, LIF and the neurotrophins BDNF and NT3 additively promote survival of stem cell-derived neurons. CONCLUSION: Our results implicate LIF as a powerful tool to control neural differentiation and maintenance of stem cell-derived murine spiral ganglion neuron precursors. This finding could be relevant in cell replacement studies with animal models featuring spiral ganglion neuron degeneration. The additive effect of the combination of LIF and BDNF/NT3 on stem cell-derived neuronal survival is similar to their effect on primary spiral ganglion neurons, which puts forward spiral ganglion-derived neurospheres as an in vitro model system to study aspects of auditory neuron development.","['Oshima, Kazuo', 'Teo, Dawn Tju Wei', 'Senn, Pascal', 'Starlinger, Veronika', 'Heller, Stefan']","['Oshima K', 'Teo DT', 'Senn P', 'Starlinger V', 'Heller S']","['Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Stanford CA, USA. oshimak@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071012,England,BMC Dev Biol,BMC developmental biology,100966973,"['0 (5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (Succinimides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Morphogenesis', 'Neurotrophin 3/genetics', 'Spiral Ganglion/*cytology/growth & development', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Succinimides']",2007/10/16 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-213X-7-112 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-213X-7-112 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Dev Biol. 2007 Oct 12;7:112. doi: 10.1186/1471-213X-7-112.,,,PMC2080640,,"['R01 DC006167/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'DC006167/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intrigue of this pathway undoubtedly lies in its ability to influence diverse cellular processes, including differentiation, cell fate, homeostasis, survival, proliferation and angiogenesis. Based on its evolutionary conservation and its fundamental role in development, it is not surprising that deregulation of the Notch signaling pathway can result in neoplastic growth. While originally of particular interest to immunologists based on its chief role in influencing T-cell fate decisions and tumor oncogenesis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, pigment cell biologists have recently taken notice of the Notch cascade based on studies suggesting the importance of this pathway in regulating melanocyte stem cell survival and melanoma progression.

Among these, 63% were cancer-related proteins and 74% were described for the first time in leukemia cells. Multivariate analysis highlighted significant differences in the global proteomic profile of the three CML cell lines. In particular, the detailed analysis of 35 differentially expressed proteins revealed that LAMA84 cells preferentially expressed proteins associated with an invasive behavior, while K562 and KCL22 cells preferentially expressed proteins involved in drug resistance. These data demonstrate that these CML cell lines, although representing the same pathological phenotype, show characteristics in their protein expression profile that suggest different phenotypic leukemia subclasses. These data contribute a new potential characterization of the CML phenotype and may help to understand interpatient variability in the progression of disease and in the efficacy of a treatment.","['Fontana, Simona', 'Alessandro, Riccardo', 'Barranca, Marilisa', 'Giordano, Margherita', 'Corrado, Chiara', 'Zanella-Cleon, Isabelle', 'Becchi, Michel', 'Kohn, Elise C', 'De Leo, Giacomo']","['Fontana S', 'Alessandro R', 'Barranca M', 'Giordano M', 'Corrado C', 'Zanella-Cleon I', 'Becchi M', 'Kohn EC', 'De Leo G']","['Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Universita di Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071013,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)']",IM,"['Acridine Orange/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Ethidium/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics/*methods']",2007/10/16 09:00,2008/01/03 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/pr0704128 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2007 Nov;6(11):4330-42. doi: 10.1021/pr0704128.

Furthermore, imatinib has shown unsurpassed efficacy in the less common, but not less problematic chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Multi-target agents like sunitinib, sorafenib, and lapatinib have already yielded promising results and new agents are being developed.

Next, we examined whether cyclosporin A reduced expression of Tax and its related transfer factors on Western blot and CAT assay. We further investigated whether cyclosporin A in combination with VP-16 can induce apoptosis in HTLV-1 infected T cells. Tax-producing T cells, K3T and F6T, were resistant to VP-16 induced growth inhibition compared with that of the nonproducing cells, S1T and Su9T01. Experiments using S1T and Tax-expressing cDNA-transfected S1T demonstrated Tax-induced resistance to VP-16 induction of apoptosis by DNA ladder formation. Cyclosporin A reduced Tax expression in K3T by Western blot analysis and on CAT assay, showing maximal reduction of 61% and 60% compared to control culture using LTR CAT transfected Jurkat cells and K3T cells, respectively. Cyclosporin A also reduced the nuclear expression of two Tax-related transfer factors, ATF-1 and ATF-2 on Western blot.

Specifically, we focused on the efflux transporters, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and an influx transporter, organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established imatinib-resistant K562 cells (K562/IM). Real-time PCR or Western blot analyses were performed to examine the mRNA or protein levels. Alamar blue method was used in the cytotoxicity assay. The transport activities and intracellular imatinib levels were measured by flow cytometry and HPLC, respectively. RESULTS: K562/IM displayed a 47-fold increase in resistance to imatinib over the parent K562 cells. Both P-gp and BCRP were overexpressed in K562/IM relative to K562. Furthermore, the intracellular imatinib level was markedly reduced in K562/IM. Interestingly, cyclosporin A, a P-gp inhibitor, but not fumitremorgin C, a BCRP inhibitor, restored both imatinib-sensitivity and the intracellular imatinib level. By contrast, no significant difference in the expression and function of OCT1 was observed between K562/IM and K562. CONCLUSIONS: P-gp, rather than BCRP or OCT1, is partially responsible for the development of imatinib-resistance due to constitutive and functional overexpression, leading to reduced intracellular accumulation of imatinib in K562/IM.","['Hirayama, Chie', 'Watanabe, Hiroshi', 'Nakashima, Reiko', 'Nanbu, Takeru', 'Hamada, Akinobu', 'Kuniyasu, Akihiko', 'Nakayama, Hitoshi', 'Kawaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Saito, Hideyuki']","['Hirayama C', 'Watanabe H', 'Nakashima R', 'Nanbu T', 'Hamada A', 'Kuniyasu A', 'Nakayama H', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Saito H']","['Department of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University Hospital, 1-1-1 Honjo, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071013,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'CW5S8OP3VO (tryptoquivaline)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/10/16 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11095-007-9376-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 2008 Apr;25(4):827-35. doi: 10.1007/s11095-007-9376-3.

THDA-induced apoptosis was associated with the upregulation of Bax, downregulation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), as well as the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein family kinases, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinases, and the transcription factor c-Jun were all activated by phosphorylation after 6 h exposure to THDA. Phosphorylation (activation) of JNK and ERK kinases by THDA was blocked by an ERK inhibitor, PD98059, or a JNK inhibitor, JNK-1, respectively, suggesting that THDA-induced apoptosis in K562 cells is ERK and JNK dependent. Moreover, the blockade of ERK and JNK also attenuated the modulation of Bax and XIAP, as well as the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 induced by THDA. These findings suggest that the activation of JNK and ERK is involved in the THDA-induced apoptosis of K562 cells.

However, the mechanism underlying this function of A. blazei Murill remains obscure. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of fraction FA-2-b-ss, an RNA-protein complex isolated from A. blazei Murill, on human leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro. Typical apoptotic characteristics were determined by morphological methods using DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. The growth suppressive effect of fraction FA-2-b-ss on HL-60 cells in vitro occurred in a dose- (5-80 microg/mL) and time-dependent (24-96 h) manner. The proliferation of HL-60 cells (1 x 10(5) cells/mL) treated with 40 microg/mL of fraction FA-2-b-ss for 24-96 h and with 5-80 microg/mL for 96 h resulted in inhibitory rates ranging from 8 to 54.5%, and from 4.9 to 86.3%, respectively. Both telomerase activity determined by TRAP-ELISA and mRNA expression of the caspase-3 gene detected by RT-PCR were increased in HL-60 cells during fraction FA-2-b-ss treatment. The rate of apoptosis correlated negatively with the decrease of telomerase activity (r = 0.926, P < 0.05), but correlated positively with caspase-3 mRNA expression (r = 0.926, P < 0.05). These data show that fraction FA-2-b-ss can induce HL-60 cell apoptosis and that the combined effect of down-regulation of telomerase activity and up-regulation of mRNA expression of the caspase-3 gene could be the primary mechanism of induction of apoptosis. These findings provide strong evidence that fraction FA-2-b-ss could be of interest for the clinical treatment of acute leukemia.","['Gao, L', 'Sun, Y', 'Chen, C', 'Xi, Y', 'Wang, J', 'Wang, Z']","['Gao L', 'Sun Y', 'Chen C', 'Xi Y', 'Wang J', 'Wang Z']","['School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Fungal)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Agaricus/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/analysis', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'RNA, Fungal/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/analysis', 'Time Factors']",2007/10/16 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2007001100015 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2007001100015 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2007 Nov;40(11):1545-55. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2007001100015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the miRNA expression profile of chronic and acute lymphocytic leukemias (CLL and ALL) using the TaqMan MicroRNA Assays Human Panel (Applied Biosystems). Pooled leukemia samples were compared to pooled CD19+ samples from healthy individuals (calibrator) by the 2-DD Ct method.

The miR-17-92 cluster was also found to be up-regulated in ALL, as previously reported for some types of lymphomas. The differences observed in gene expression levels were validated for miR-331 and miR-128b in ALL and CD19+ samples. These miRNAs were up-regulated in ALL, in agreement with our initial results. A brief target analysis was performed for miR-331. One of its putative targets, SOCS1, promotes STAT activation, which is a known mediator of cell proliferation and survival, suggesting the possibility of an association between miR-331 and these processes. This initial screening provided information on miRNA differentially expressed in normal and malignant B-cells that could suggest the potential roles of these miRNAs in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.","['Zanette, D L', 'Rivadavia, F', 'Molfetta, G A', 'Barbuzano, F G', 'Proto-Siqueira, R', 'Silva, W A Jr', 'Falcao, R P', 'Zago, M A']","['Zanette DL', 'Rivadavia F', 'Molfetta GA', 'Barbuzano FG', 'Proto-Siqueira R', 'Silva WA Jr', 'Falcao RP', 'Zago MA']","['Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2007/10/16 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2007001100003 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2007001100003 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2007 Nov;40(11):1435-40. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2007001100003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr is a phosphoprotein with a novel serine/threonine kinase activity encoded by its first exon. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, Bcr-Abl phosphorylates Bcr on tyrosine residues reducing its kinase activity. Overexpression of BCR in BCR-ABL+ cells produces a phosphoserine form of Bcr, which inhibits the oncogenic effects of BCR-ABL. To investigate the inhibitory effects of Bcr on Bcr-Abl, we expressed BCR/GFP in TonB210 cells, which contain a tetracycline-inducible BCR-ABL. In nude mice injected with cell clones of TonB210/BCR/GFP, tumor formation was delayed, and tumors were 50% smaller compared with the TonB210/GFP. In addition, TonB210/ BCR/GFP cells had little colony-forming ability in soft agar compared with TonB210/GFP cells. In contrast, a point mutant of BCR (Y360F), which disrupts its kinase activity, not only blocked Bcr's inhibitory effects but also enhanced the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl in a solid tumor model and in soft agar colony assays. Similar effects were observed with a second BCR kinase domain mutant, S354A. These results indicate that the inhibitory function of Bcr directed toward Bcr-Abl requires its kinase function.","['Perazzona, B', 'Lin, H', 'Sun, T', 'Wang, Y', 'Arlinghaus, R']","['Perazzona B', 'Lin H', 'Sun T', 'Wang Y', 'Arlinghaus R']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071015,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutant Proteins/physiology', 'Phosphotransferases/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2007/10/16 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210851 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210851 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Apr 3;27(15):2208-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210851.

TAL1, LYL1, HOX11 and other transcription factors essential for normal hematopoiesis are often misexpressed in the thymus in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), leading to differentiation arrest and cell transformation. Recent advances in the ability to assess DNA copy number have led to the discovery that the MYB transcription factor oncogene is tandemly duplicated in T-ALL. The NOTCH1 gene, which is essential for key embryonic cell-fate decisions in multicellular organisms, was found to be activated by mutation in a large percentage of T-ALL patients. The gene encoding the FBW7 protein ubiquitin ligase, which regulates the turnover of the intracellular form of NOTCH (ICN), is also mutated in T-ALL, resulting in stabilization of the ICN and activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway. In mature B-lineage ALL and Burkitt lymphoma, the MYC transcription factor oncogene is overexpressed due to translocation into the IG locus. PAX5, a transcription factor essential for B-lineage commitment, is inactivated in 32% of cases of B-progenitor ALL. Translocations resulting in oncogenic fusion transcription factors also occur frequently in this form of ALL. The most frequent transcription factor chimeric fusion, TEL-AML1, is an initiating event in B-progenitor ALL that acts by repressing transcription. Therefore, deregulated transcription and its consequent effects on key developmental pathways play a major role in the molecular pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancy. Once the full complement of cooperating mutations in transformed B- and T-progenitor cells is known, and the deregulated downstream pathways have been elucidated, it will be possible to identify vulnerable components and to target them with small-molecule inhibitors.","[""O'Neil, J"", 'Look, A T']","[""O'Neil J"", 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology']",2007/10/16 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210766 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210766 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Oct 15;26(47):6838-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210766.,,170,,,['CA109901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genomic events and pathways involved in the transformation of hematopoietic precursors into leukemic stem cells are increasingly understood. This concept is based on genomic mutations or functional dysregulation of transcription factors in malignant cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Loss of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (CEBPA) function in myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo leads to a differentiation block, similar to that observed in blasts from AML patients. CEBPA alterations in specific subgroups of AML comprise genomic mutations leading to dominant-negative mutant proteins, transcriptional suppression by leukemic fusion proteins, translational inhibition by activated RNA-binding proteins, and functional inhibition by phosphorylation or increased proteasomal-dependent degradation. The PU.1 gene can be mutated or its expression or function can be blocked by leukemogenic fusion proteins in AML. Point mutations in the RUNX1/AML1 gene are also observed in specific subtypes of AML, in addition to RUNX1 being the most frequent target for chromosomal translocation in AML. These data are persuasive evidence that impaired function of particular transcription factors contributes directly to the development of human AML, and restoring their function represents a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies in AML.","['Pabst, T', 'Mueller, B U']","['Pabst T', 'Mueller BU']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland. thomas.pabst@insel.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2007/10/16 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210765 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210765 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Oct 15;26(47):6829-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210765.,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large body of evidence now links Hox genes to leukemic transformation including dysregulated HOX expression in leukemic patient samples, their involvement as oncogenic fusion proteins with NUP98 and their requirement for the oncogenicity of Mll fusions. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the identification and characterization of leukemic stem cells.

An additional layer of complexity is added by the occurrence of different haematopoietic cell hierarchies at different stages of ontogeny. Beyond these issues of cell context dependence, it is important from a mechanistic point of view to define the particular cell fate pathway impacted by any given regulator. Herein, we advance the notion that haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which sustain haematopoiesis throughout adult life and are specified in foetal life, have a minimal or late contribution to foetal haematopoiesis but instead largely proliferate during the foetal period.

It was suggested that Th1-type cytokines (IFN-gamma and TNF-beta), which promote allograft rejection, may compromise pregnancy, whereas the Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) inhibiting the Th1 responses promote allograft tolerance and therefore may improve fetal survival. We found that T cells' leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), M-CSF, IL-4 and IL-10 production at the fetomaternal interface could contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy. Interestingly, we did not find an increased production of IFN-gamma by decidual T cells during spontaneous abortion, as expected. We detected T cells in the cumulus oophorus, which surrounds the oocyte during ovulation and the egg before implantation. Cumulus oophorus T cells produce higher levels of IL-4 and LIF than the T cells of peripheral blood or the ovary. We can only speculate what the factors present in the microenvironment of the T cells are that could be responsible for the cytokine profile of decidual and cumulus oophorus T cells. Hormones present in the decidua and in the cumulus oophorus could be the first candidates. In particular, progesterone is a potent inducer of production of Th2-type cytokines, LIF and M-CSF.

DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, PreMedline, CancerLit, and LILACS to find studies published between 1992 and 2003 on non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and 8 solid-tumour cancers: brain, breast, kidney, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and stomach cancer. STUDY SELECTION: Each title and abstract was assessed for relevance; disagreements among reviewers were resolved by consensus. Studies were assessed by a team of 2 trained reviewers and rated based on methodologic quality according to a 5-page assessment tool and a global assessment scale. Studies rated below a global score of 4 out of 7 were excluded. SYNTHESIS: Most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure. Some showed dose-response relationships, and a few were able to identify specific pesticides. Children's and pregnant women's exposure to pesticides was positively associated with the cancers studied in some studies, as was parents' exposure to pesticides at work. Many studies showed positive associations between pesticide exposure and solid tumours. The most consistent associations were found for brain and prostate cancer. An association was also found between kidney cancer in children and their parents' exposure to pesticides at work. These associations were most consistent for high and prolonged exposures. Specific weaknesses and inherent limitations in epidemiologic studies were noted, particularly around ascertaining whether and how much exposure had taken place. CONCLUSION: Our findings support attempts to reduce exposure to pesticides. Reductions are likely best achieved through decreasing pesticide use for cosmetic (non-commercial) purposes (where children might be exposed) and on the job.","['Bassil, K L', 'Vakil, C', 'Sanborn, M', 'Cole, D C', 'Kaur, J S', 'Kerr, K J']","['Bassil KL', 'Vakil C', 'Sanborn M', 'Cole DC', 'Kaur JS', 'Kerr KJ']","[""Family Medicine Centre, Queen's University, 220 Bagot St, Kingston, ON. cv4@post.queensu.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,Canada,Can Fam Physician,Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,0120300,['0 (Pesticide Residues)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Pesticide Residues/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemically induced']",2007/10/16 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['53/10/1704 [pii]'],ppublish,Can Fam Physician. 2007 Oct;53(10):1704-11.,,94,PMC2231435,,,,,,,"['Can Fam Physician. 2007 Oct;53(10):1631.

Meiotic progression can also be triggered without sperm, as in parthenogenesis, although the classic mouse in vivo parthenogenetic model, LT/Sv, fails in meiosis I owing to an unknown molecular etiology. Here, we dissect PLCZ1 specificity and function in vivo and address its ability to interfere with maternal meiotic exit. Wild-type mouse Plcz1 expression was restricted to post-pubertal testes and the brains of both sexes, with region-specifying elements mapping to a 4.1 kb Plcz1 promoter fragment. When broad ectopic PLCZ1 expression was forced in independent transgenic lines, they initially appeared healthy. Their oocytes underwent unperturbed meiotic maturation to mII but subsequently exhibited autonomous intracellular free calcium oscillations, second polar body extrusion, pronucleus formation and parthenogenetic development. Transfer of transgenic cumulus cell nuclei into wild-type oocytes induced activation and development, demonstrating a direct effect of PLCZ1 analogous to fertilisation. Whereas Plcz1 transgenic males remained largely asymptomatic, females developed abdominal swellings caused by benign ovarian teratomas that were under-represented for paternally- and placentally-expressed transcripts. Plcz1 was not overexpressed in the ovaries of LT/Sv or in human germline ovarian tumours. The narrow spectrum of PLCZ1 activity indicates that it is modulated by tissue-restricted accessory factors. This work characterises a novel model in which parthenogenesis and tumourigenesis follow full meiotic maturation and are linked to fertilisation by PLCZ1.","['Yoshida, Naoko', 'Amanai, Manami', 'Fukui, Tomoyuki', 'Kajikawa, Eriko', 'Brahmajosyula, Manjula', 'Iwahori, Akiko', 'Nakano, Yoshikazu', 'Shoji, Shisako', 'Diebold, Joachim', 'Hessel, Harald', 'Huss, Ralf', 'Perry, Anthony C F']","['Yoshida N', 'Amanai M', 'Fukui T', 'Kajikawa E', 'Brahmajosyula M', 'Iwahori A', 'Nakano Y', 'Shoji S', 'Diebold J', 'Hessel H', 'Huss R', 'Perry AC']","['Laboratory of Mammalian Molecular Embryology, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, 2-2-3 Minatojima Minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (PLCZ1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Plcz1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Oocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Parthenogenesis', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spermatozoa/*metabolism']",2007/10/16 09:00,2008/01/15 09:00,['2007/10/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['134/21/3941 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.007930 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2007 Nov;134(21):3941-52. doi: 10.1242/dev.007930.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combination of new antifungal agents may improve outcome in this patient population. Here, triple anti-mycotic therapy is described in an relapsed ALL patient in urgent need of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia of thymic differentiation achieved remission after treatment according to the German ALL protocol 07/03. Two months after the consolidation therapy relapse occurred requiring high dose chemotherapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. One day after start of the conditioning regimen the patient showed skin manifestations typical for septic mycosis and blood cultures became positive for Candida krusei while on fluconazole prophylaxis. Because of the limited sensibility of fluconazole resistant candida species to liposomal amphotericin B and the high mortality rate in patients with systemic candidiasis, voriconazole was added immediately to liposomal amphotericin B. Since fever did not resolve and the conditioning therapy for allogeneic transplantation was not yet completed caspofungin was added. Skin manifestation responded to this triple anti-mycotic combination and peripheral blood stem cells from an unrelated donor were transplanted. With the triple antifungal therapy the patient finally became afebrile, skin manifestations showed complete resolution and blood cultures became negative. Three months after the onset of systemic candidiasis the patient was fully active with no signs of fungal infection and in haematological and molecular remission. Mycotic sepsis at the start of myeloablative conditioning therapy in heavily pretreated acute leukemia patients is usually considered as not allowing successful allogeneic transplantation. Thus this case demonstrates, that allogeneic stem cell transplantation is feasible in patients presenting with systemic candidiasis if combined antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin and voriconazole is given.","['Gahn, B', 'Schub, N', 'Repp, R', 'Gramatzki, M']","['Gahn B', 'Schub N', 'Repp R', 'Gramatzki M']","['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, University Medical Center SH Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.

CONCLUSION: The pathological mechanisms of typhlitis remain unclear in neutropenic patients. The role of cytotoxic drugs as well as both bacterial overgrowth and translocation has been postulated.

Febrile patients with hematologic malignancies and pulmonary infiltrates have high mortality rates, especially if mechanical ventilation is required. The diagnostic value of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in these patients is controversial. We retrospectively analyzed the microbiological results of BAL samples obtained during 249 FOB examinations from 199 febrile patients with hematologic malignancies and pulmonary infiltrates (underlying diseases: acute leukemia 103 patients, lymphoma 84 patients, other malignancies 12 patients). Two hundred forty-six examinations could be evaluated. Seventy-three out of 246 BAL samples were sterile; 55 samples showed microbiological findings classified as contamination or colonization. One hundred eighteen samples showed positive microbiological results of bacteria and/or fungi classified as causative pathogens. Thereof, in 70 samples, only bacterial pathogens were detectable (Gram-positive, 35; Gram-negative, 30; mixed Gram-positive and Gram-negative, 5). Thirteen samples showed both fungi and bacterial pathogens. In 33 samples, only fungi were detectable, thereof, in 15 samples Aspergillus species, in 16 samples Candida species, and in 2 both. In two samples, a viral pathogen could be detected. Three nonlethal complications (bleeding, arrhythmia) occurred that required early termination of FOB. In 94 (38.2%) patient episodes, antibiotic treatment was modified as a result of microbiological findings in BAL samples. Our results show that FOB with BAL is a valuable diagnostic tool with low complication rates in high-risk febrile patients with hematologic malignancies and pulmonary infiltrates, contributing crucial results for the individual case, and also improving epidemiologic knowledge.","['Hummel, Margit', 'Rudert, Silke', 'Hof, Herbert', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Buchheidt, Dieter']","['Hummel M', 'Rudert S', 'Hof H', 'Hehlmann R', 'Buchheidt D']","['3 Medizinische Klinik, Universitatsklinikum Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany. margit.hummel@med3.ma.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071012,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*cytology', 'Bronchoscopy/*methods', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Fiber Optic Technology', 'Fungi/isolation & purification', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/10/13 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-007-0391-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Apr;87(4):291-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0391-6.

Here, we demonstrate that mature human neutrophils, but not eosinophils, express functional GPR109A receptors. The induction of the GPR109A gene appears to occur late in the terminal differentiation process of neutrophils, since a mixed population of immature bone marrow neutrophils did not demonstrate evidence for its expression. NA accelerated apoptosis in cultured neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner, as assessed by phosphatidylserine redistribution, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation assays. The pro-apoptotic effect of NA was abolished by pertussis toxin, which was used to block G(i) proteins, suggesting a receptor-mediated mechanism. Activation of GPR109A by NA resulted in decreased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), most likely due to G(i)-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. NA-induced apoptosis was reversed by the addition of cell-permeable cAMP, pointing to the possibility that reduced cAMP levels promote apoptosis in neutrophils. Distal mechanism involved in this process may include the post-translational modification of members of the Bcl-2 family, such as dephosphorylation of pro-apoptotic Bad and antiapoptotic Mcl-1 proteins. Taken together, following maturation in the bone marrow, neutrophils express functional GPR109A receptors, which might be involved in the regulation of neutrophil numbers. Moreover, this study identified a new cellular target of NA and future drugs activating GPR109A receptors, the mature neutrophil.","['Kostylina, G', 'Simon, D', 'Fey, M F', 'Yousefi, S', 'Simon, H U']","['Kostylina G', 'Simon D', 'Fey MF', 'Yousefi S', 'Simon HU']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Friedbuhlstrasse 49, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071012,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (HCAR2 protein, human)', '0 (HCAR3 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Nicotinic)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '2679MF687A (Niacin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Niacin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Nicotinic/*metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2007/10/13 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['4402238 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4402238 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2008 Jan;15(1):134-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4402238.

We hypothesized that Oct-4 might be involved in survival of undifferentiated ES cells under stress. The Oct-4 tetracycline conditional knockout cell line ZHBtc4 was used to test this possibility, and apoptosis was induced by either etoposide, heat shock, or UV exposure. Apoptosis in Oct-4 knocked-down ES cells was significantly increased in response to all stress situations compared with parental cells. Oct-4 knockdown was not associated with changes in morphology or expression of Nanog, SSEA-1, KLF-4, or Sox2 within the time frame and culture conditions used, suggesting that enhanced sensitivity of these cells to apoptosis was not due to an overtly differentiated state of the cells. To address potential intracellular mediators, we focused on the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family member Survivin, an antiapoptosis protein. The Survivin promoter was transfected into ES cells after knockdown of Oct-4. Survivin promoter activity was dramatically decreased in the Oct-4 knockdown cells. Western blots substantiated that Oct-4 knockdown ES cells had decreased Survivin protein expression. Since the Survivin promoter does not have binding sites for Oct-4, this suggested an indirect effect of Oct-4 on expression of Survivin. Leukemia inhibitory factor-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) is responsible for ES cell survival, and STAT3 regulates Survivin expression in breast cancer cells. Western blot analysis showed that downregulated Oct-4 was associated with decreased phosphorylation of STAT3. Our results suggest that Oct-4 is essential for antiapoptosis of ES cells in response to stress, effects that may be mediated through the STAT3/Survivin pathway.","['Guo, Ying', 'Mantel, Charlie', 'Hromas, Robert A', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E']","['Guo Y', 'Mantel C', 'Hromas RA', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202-5181, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071011,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Birc5 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Survivin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Hot Temperature', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repressor Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Transfection', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2007/10/13 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007-0401 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2007-0401 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2008 Jan;26(1):30-4. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2007-0401.

A-T patients show a broad and diverse phenotype, which includes an increased rate of lymphoma and leukemia development. Fas-induced apoptosis plays a fundamental role in the homeostasis of the immune system and its defects have been associated with autoimmunity and lymphoma development. We therefore investigated the role of ATM kinase in Fas-induced apoptosis. Using A-T lymphoid cells, we could show that ATM deficiency causes resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. A-T cells up-regulate FLIP protein levels, a well-known inhibitor of Fas-induced apoptosis. Reconstitution of ATM kinase activity was sufficient to decrease FLIP levels and to restore Fas sensitivity. Conversely, genetic and pharmacologic ATM kinase inactivation resulted in FLIP protein up-regulation and Fas resistance. Both ATM and FLIP are aberrantly regulated in Hodgkin lymphoma. Importantly, we found that reconstitution of ATM kinase activity decreases FLIP protein levels and restores Fas sensitivity in Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cells. Overall, these data identify a novel molecular mechanism through which ATM kinase may regulate the immune system homeostasis and impair lymphoma development.","['Stagni, Venturina', 'di Bari, Maria Giovanna', 'Cursi, Silvia', 'Condo, Ivano', 'Cencioni, Maria Teresa', 'Testi, Roberto', 'Lerenthal, Yaniv', 'Cundari, Enrico', 'Barila, Daniela']","['Stagni V', 'di Bari MG', 'Cursi S', 'Condo I', 'Cencioni MT', 'Testi R', 'Lerenthal Y', 'Cundari E', 'Barila D']","['Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071011,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Autoimmunity/genetics', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/10/13 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48502-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-085399 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):829-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-085399.

To test the mutagenic potential of this RNA lesion in the context of retroviruses, we synthesized a 31-mer oligoribonucleotide containing an abasic (rAS) site and used it as a template for studying DNA primer extension by HIV-1, avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reversed transcriptases (RT). We found that trans-lesion synthesis readily takes place with HIV-1 RT and to a lesser extent with AMV RT while MMLV RT aborts DNA synthesis. The preference of dNTP incorporation follows the order A approximately G > C approximately T and thus obeys to the 'A-rule'. In the case of HIV-1 RT, we measured the kinetic data of dNTP incorporation and compared it to abasic DNA. We found that A-incorporation is only 2-fold slower relative to a matched (undamaged) RNA template while it is 7-fold slower in the case of DNA. Furthermore, there is less discrimination in incorporation between the four dNTPs in the case of abasic RNA compared to abasic DNA. These experiments clearly point to a higher promiscuity of lesion bypass on abasic RNA. Given their known higher chemical stability, such rAS sites can clearly contribute to (retro)viral evolution.","['Kupfer, Pascal A', 'Crey-Desbiolles, Caroline', 'Leumann, Christian J']","['Kupfer PA', 'Crey-Desbiolles C', 'Leumann CJ']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern, Freiestrasse 3, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071011,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*enzymology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'RNA/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",2007/10/13 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkm767 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkm767 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(20):6846-53. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkm767.

Diagnosis was according to World Health Organization criteria, prognosis assigned by the international index and therapy risk-stratified with results subject to appropriate statistical methodology. None of these patients underwent transplantation. For the cohort the median age was 55 years (range 11-94) and 63% were male. Constitutional symptoms were present in 22%; a quarter had previous chemotherapy and a third some form of irradiation prior to referral. Fifty-seven percent were stage I or II and 21% had nodal disease above and below the diaphragm whilst in the remainder cells were present in the circulation and this included the subset of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia -- small lymphocytic lymphoma. Positron emission scanning was not available for these studies. Median survival for the cohort is 3.2 years and reduced to 1.3 years by the presence of unexplained fever, sweating or inappropriate weight loss. Further adverse factors included any prior treatment, intermediate or high-grade histopathology, risk factors defined by the International Prognostic Index as well as late Rai stages. Analysed by disease category Hodgkin lymphoma (n=17) when managed according to the German Study Group protocols and hairy cell leukaemia (n=10) treated with two chlorodeoxyadenosine -- both had a stable plateau in excess of 90%. The corresponding figures for follicular variants (n=31) was 72% in the low risk and 58% in the remainder when treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone. Curves for the aggressive or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=44) fell initially to 48%, but relapse continued in stages III and IV to the current level of 18% when receiving cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine and prednisone on the 21-day schedule. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia -- small lymphocytic lymphoma (n=58) were initially given pulsed chlorambucil and sustained response was over 90% with low bulk, but declined to reach 30% as prognostic score rose. The miscellaneous categories (n<5 each) managed variably, but using the same criteria, were pooled and are presently at 62% and 30% for high and low grades. It is concluded that precise diagnosis, accurate staging and therapy on standardised risk-stratified programmes, delivered uniformly by a single multidisciplinary group, creates the all-important centre effect; matching figures are unlikely to apply outside these disciplined circumstances. The expectation from patients and referring physicians alike is that, since lymphomas are potentially curable, such an approach to comprehensive management will be regarded as standard even in an under resourced or Third World country. It follows that late referral and prior therapy will adversely affect performance status and compromise life span: These alternative approaches are inappropriate and strongly discouraged.","['Wood, Lucille', 'Robinson, Rowan', 'Gavine, Lindsey', 'Juritz, June', 'Jacobs, Peter']","['Wood L', 'Robinson R', 'Gavine L', 'Juritz J', 'Jacobs P']","['The Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Incorporating The Searll Research Laboratory for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Constantiaberg Medi-Clinic, Plumstead, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071010,England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hospitals, Private', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Risk Factors', 'South Africa', 'Survival Rate']",2007/10/13 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1473-0502(07)00103-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transci.2007.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2007 Aug;37(1):93-102. doi: 10.1016/j.transci.2007.06.002.

However, its environmental exposure has been linked epidemiologically with an elevated carcinoma risk (i.e. skin, bladder and lung), with cellular oxidative stress being implicated in both induced-arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity. Consequently, antioxidants may differentially interfere in these effects. The human mammary adenocarcinoma lines MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 were treated in vitro with 200 microM NaAsO(2) (As), 5 microM silymarin (S) and/or 50 microM quercetin (Q). The following biomembrane parameters were assessed: sialic acid (SA) in gangliosides, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity (GGT), conjugated dienes and free radical activity, in order to evaluate the arsenite-flavonoid interactions. The time-dependent arsenite toxicity was not prevented by flavonoids in ZR-75-1 cells, whereas quercetin protected MCF-7 cells for 8 h. With regard to GGT, only quercetin protected ZR-75-1 cells against stress. In MCF-7 cells, the arsenite-induced GGT activity was not counteracted by either quercetin or silymarin. S, Q, As and As + S treatments reduced the SA content only in the MCF-7 membrane, while As + Q treatment increased it in both lines. The membrane resistance to lipid oxidation in these cells enclosed the up-regulation of GGT activity and sialylglycolipid content. Taking these results together, quercetin interfered with arsenite toxicity, whereas silymarin was not able. Thus, the potential role of flavonoids as co-adjutants may differ widely in therapeutic protocols.","['Soria, Elio A', 'Eynard, Aldo R', 'Quiroga, Patricia L', 'Bongiovanni, Guillermina A']","['Soria EA', 'Eynard AR', 'Quiroga PL', 'Bongiovanni GA']","['1a Catedra de Biologia Celular, Histologia y Embriologia, Instituto de Biologia Celular, Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070925,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Arsenites/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Silymarin/*pharmacology', 'Sodium Compounds/*toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/metabolism']",2007/10/13 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(07)00708-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2007.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2007 Oct 13;81(17-18):1397-402. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2007.09.008.

Previous studies indicate that Zap-70 and CD38 are usually positive in cases of CLL with unmutated immunoglobulin variable region genes (IgVH) and may be used to predict IgVH mutation status and prognosis. Usually cases of CLL positive for Zap-70 or CD38 indicate a worse prognosis. In the present investigation, 47 cases of CLL were evaluated for CD38 expression, and 17 cases were evaluated for both Zap-70 and CD38 expression. Of the 47 cases, 19 (40.4%) positively expressed CD38. Of the 17 cases evaluated for Zap-70, 11 (64.7%) were positive for Zap-70, while only 6 (35.3%) were positive for CD38 expression; the remaining cases were negative for CD38. The results of this study show that Zap-70 expression may be a better indicator of the mutational status of IgVH and prognosis of CLL than CD38 expression. In addition, CD38 negativity does not necessarily indicate that IgVH mutation has occurred. These data point to the need for a more extensive study to evaluate the significance of Zap-70 and CD38 expression as indicators of IgVH mutation status and prognosis of CLL patients.","['Cruse, Julius M', 'Lewis, Robert E', 'Webb, Rachel N', 'Sanders, Catherine M', 'Suggs, Jeanann L']","['Cruse JM', 'Lewis RE', 'Webb RN', 'Sanders CM', 'Suggs JL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070907,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/10/13 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(07)00106-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2007 Dec;83(3):459-61. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.08.009.

Immunohistochemically the inclusions showed positive staining with KM279, a monoclonal antibody against polyglucosan derived from Lafora inclusions. On electron microscopy, in case 1, intracytoplasmic inclusions were composed of degenerate organelles, glycogen, and irregular fibrillar structures; in case 2, they were composed of vesicular structures containing granular material. Ultrastructural changes in both cases differed from classical Lafora inclusions and ruled out hepatitis B surface antigen, glycogenosis type IV, and fibrinogen storage disease. Genetic analysis of the Lafora's disease genes performed in case 2 revealed no mutations. The development of hepatocyte cytoplasmic inclusions in both our cases could be related to medication effects, because similar inclusions were reported in patients using cyanamide.

HTLV-1 infection is rare in Canada. The last known cases prior to the present cluster in Nunavut occurred in 1993, when three Aboriginal patients with neurological symptoms in British Columbia were found to be infected with HTLV-1. The Dept. of Health and Social Services in Nunavut became aware of the presence of this virus in the Nunavut population in early June, 2005 when an individual infected with HTLV-1 died from Acute T-cell leukemia. STUDY DESIGN: A report of the interventions done by the Department in response to this outbreak. METHODS: Interviews with the key informants in the Department. A review of the record of meetings, community consultations, expert consultations and communiques was conducted. Key information points were summarized. RESULTS: A Nunavut Dept. of Health and Social Services Task Force on HTLV-1 was established. Investigation of the population in the community in which the index case was found using blood samples to identify the virus in the carriers and for antibodies in first-degree relatives of the carriers. A literature review and summary of the epidemiology of the cluster was performed. An intense educational and counseling program regarding HTLV-1 infection was initiated for the (200) health care workers in the Territory and residents in the affected communities. A territory wide publicity and educational package was developed and implemented via meetings, press conferences, and telehealth sessions. Clinical protocols for monitoring the health status of infected individuals have been implemented. Ante-natal screening for HTLV-1 has been initiated, Territory-wide. An unlinked, anonymous HTLV-1 seroprevalence study began in early 2006. To date, approximately 300 persons have been tested for HTLV-1 in Nunavut. The number of infected individuals is less than 20. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1 infection is present in Nunavut. The prevalence is unknown. There has been at least one death from Acute T-cell leukemia in an individual infected. Prenatal screening and the seroprevalence study should provide important information on the breadth of the problem and allow the Department to implement appropriate measures to better manage the spread of the virus and the clinical cases of those infected with it.","['Sobol, Isaac', 'Palacios, Carolina', 'Osborne, Geraldine', 'Hildes, Joe', 'MacDonald, William', 'Harty, Amy', 'Sanguya, Igah', 'Gilbert, Mark']","['Sobol I', 'Palacios C', 'Osborne G', 'Hildes J', 'MacDonald W', 'Harty A', 'Sanguya I', 'Gilbert M']","['Department of Health and Social Services, Government of Nunavut, Nunavut, Canada. isobol@gov.nu.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Alaska Med,Alaska medicine,0370457,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Disease Outbreaks/*prevention & control', 'Health Care Surveys', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Nunavut/epidemiology', '*Program Development', '*Program Evaluation']",2007/10/13 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/13 09:00'],"['2007/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Alaska Med. 2007;49(2 Suppl):204-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, was used to characterize the apoptotic effects of N-nitrosamines, and to examine the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Apoptotic cells were identified by (i) chromatin condensation (ii) flow cytometry analysis and (iii) poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. NPIP and NDBA induced morphological changes consistent with apoptotic events in HL-60 cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that both N-nitrosamines induced apoptotic cell death in a concentration and time dependent-manner. It was observed that NDBA was stronger than NPIP, since it induced a significant apoptotic cell death after 18 h starting from a concentration of 2 mm, whereas NPIP was effective at 10 mm. Furthermore, PARP was markedly cleaved with 0.5 mm of NDBA and 5 mm of NPIP after treatments for 3 and 18 h, respectively. Finally, the ROS level was found to be elevated after 0.5 h of treatment with both N-nitrosamines. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) completely inhibited the ROS production induced by NPIP and NDBA. However, this action seems not to be associated with the apoptosis because NAC did not block N-nitrosamines-induced apoptosis. The data demonstrate that NPIP and NDBA induce apoptosis and ROS production in HL-60 cells.","['Garcia, Almudena', 'Morales, Paloma', 'Arranz, Nuria', 'Delgado, Eugenia', 'Rafter, Joseph', 'Haza, Ana I']","['Garcia A', 'Morales P', 'Arranz N', 'Delgado E', 'Rafter J', 'Haza AI']","['Departamento de Nutricion, Bromatologia y Tecnologia de los Alimentos, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6N066XUL4L (N-nitrosopiperidine)', '8K8942WN31 (dibutylnitrosamine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nitrosamines/*toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jat.1295 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2008 May;28(4):455-65. doi: 10.1002/jat.1295.,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the Bcr-Abl kinase fusion protein and its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CML provided new opportunities to develop molecular-targeted therapies. Imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), which specifically inhibits the autophosphorylation of the Abl TK, has improved the treatment of CML. However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel TK inhibitors have been developed that override IM resistance mechanisms caused by point mutations within the Abl kinase domain. Inhibitors of Abl TK are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP noncompetitive inhibitors. The ATP-competitive inhibitors fall into two subclasses, the Src/Abl inhibitors, and the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606, and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors, while nilotinib (AMN107) and INNO-406 (NS-187) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Of these agents, dasatinib and nilotinib underwent clinical trials earlier than the others and favorable results are now accumulating. Clinical studies of the other compounds, including SKI-606 and INNO-406, have been performed in rapid succession. Because of their strong affinities for the ATP-binding site compared to IM, most ATP-competitive inhibitors may be effective in IM-resistant patients. However, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. Instead, ATP noncompetitive inhibitors, such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor MK0457 (VX-680), and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796, have been developed to address this problem. This review provides an update on the underlying pathophysiologies of disease progression and IM resistance, and discusses the development of new targeted TK inhibitors for managing CML and the importance of future strategies targeting CML stem cells.","['Maekawa, Taira', 'Ashihara, Eishi', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Maekawa T', 'Ashihara E', 'Kimura S']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku 606-8507, Japan. maekawa@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20071022,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/01/25 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10147-007-0699-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct;12(5):327-40. doi: 10.1007/s10147-007-0699-1.

Previously, we found that activin A mediated hemoglobin synthesis and cell growth inhibition through p38, whereas, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) inactivated p38 to antagonize the activin A effects. In this study, we selected three structurally different histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, apicidin, MS275, and sodium butyrate that activate p38, to probe the signal pathway from activin A to p38 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived K562 cells. HDAC inhibitors and activin A showed additive p38 phosphorylation. The enhanced phosphorylation of p38 was correlated with increased cell differentiation and decreased cell proliferation. The use of p38 inhibitor SB203580 in conjunction with activin A or with the HDAC inhibitors inhibited cell differentiation and restored cell proliferation, indicating that activin A and the HDAC inhibitors exert their effects through p38 activation. However, bFGF did not affect HDAC inhibitors-induced cell differentiation or growth inhibition. Western blots showed that p38 phosphorylation remained at similar levels with or without bFGF in the presence of HDAC inhibitors. Thus, the HDAC inhibitors activate p38 in a manner different from the activin A pathway. Furthermore, mRNA expressions for activin type I, IB, II, and IIB receptors remained constant in the presence of activin A, bFGF, or both activin A and bFGF. These results indicate that bFGF does not directly act on p38 nor on the mRNA expression levels of activin receptors but inhibit activin A activation of p38 upstream of p38 in K562 cells.","['Chen, Chun-Hsin', 'Lin, John Yi-Chung', 'Liu, Fu-Hwa', 'Chang, Ju-Ling', 'Huang, Huei-Mei']","['Chen CH', 'Lin JY', 'Liu FH', 'Chang JL', 'Huang HM']","['Department of Psychiatry, Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071011,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (activin A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Activins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/04/12 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-007-0394-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Mar;87(3):175-82. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0394-3.

However, the effective component and molecular mechanism of FLL act to inhibit tumor proliferation are unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that oleanolic acid (OA), a principal chemical component of FLL, inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia HL60 cells in culture. MTT assay showed that treatment of HL60 cells with FLL crude extracts or OA dramatically blocked the growth of target tumor cell in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Morphological changes of the nuclei and DNA fragmentation showed that apoptotic cell death occurred in the HL60 cells after treating with FLL extracts (20 mg/ml) or OA (3.65 x 10(-2) mg/ml). Furthermore, flow cytometry assay showed that treatment of HL60 cells with FLL or OA caused an increased accumulation of G(1) and sub-G(1) subpopulations. Western blot analysis showed that caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated, accompanied by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the target cells during FLL- or OA-induced apoptosis.

The results of cell proliferation analysis revealed that human calprotectin initiated growth inhibition of the tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner. The intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of human calprotectin (50 microg/ml) in the presence of calcium and zinc ions show a reduction in fluorescence intensity, reflecting a conformational change within the protein with exposure of aromatic residues to the protein surface that is important for the biological function of calprotectin. The far ultraviolet-circular dichroism spectra of human calprotectin in the presence of calcium and zinc ions at physiological concentrations show a decrease in the alpha-helical content of the protein and an increase in beta- and other structures.

We studied the relationship between molecular-cytogenetic abnormalities and T-cell development stage to investigate whether arrest at specific stages can explain the prognostic significance of specific abnormalities. We extensively studied 72 pediatric T-ALL cases for genetic abnormalities and expression of transcription factors, NOTCH1 mutations and expression of specific CD markers. HOX11 cases were CD1 positive consistent with a cortical stage, but as 4/5 cases lacked cytoplasmatic-beta expression, developmental arrest may precede beta-selection. HOX11L2 was especially confined to immature and pre-AB developmental stages, but 3/17 HOX11L2 mature cases were restricted to the gammadelta-lineage. TAL1 rearrangements were restricted to the alphabeta-lineage with most cases being TCR-alphabeta positive. NOTCH1 mutations were present in all molecular-cytogenetic subgroups without restriction to a specific developmental stage. CALM-AF10 was associated with early relapse.

Since MLL rearrangement leads patients in a group with an unfavorable prognosis, search for cryptic rearrangements of MLL was performed in 34 patients and showed abnormalities in 5 (15%). When we applied the most frequent definition of complex karyotypes (three or more abnormalities), all patients with high hyperdiploid AML fall in the unfavorable category. Among the 18 patients without MLL rearrangement receiving an induction therapy, 16 (89%) reached CR and 6 (33%) were still alive after a 31-month median follow-up (14-61 months).

We have investigated the therapeutic potential of the novel Akt inhibitor, perifosine, on human AML cells. Perifosine is a synthetic alkylphospholipid, a new class of antitumor agents, which target plasma membrane and inhibit signal transduction networks. Perifosine was tested on THP-1 and MV 4-11 cell lines, as well as primary leukemia cells. Perifosine treatment induced cell death by apoptosis in AML cell lines. Perifosine caused Akt and ERK 1/2 dephosphorylation as well as caspase activation. In THP-1 cells, the proapoptotic effect of perifosine was partly dependent on the Fas/FasL system and c-jun-N-kinase activation. In MV 4-11 cells, perifosine downregulated phosphorylated Akt, but not phosphorylated FLT3. Moreover, perifosine reduced the clonogenic activity of AML, but not normal, CD34(+) cells, and markedly increased blast cell sensitivity to etoposide. Our findings indicate that perifosine, either alone or in combination with existing drugs, might be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of those AML cases characterized by upregulation of the PI3K-Akt survival pathway.","['Papa, V', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Chiarini, F', 'Cappellini, A', 'Ricci, F', 'Billi, A M', 'Evangelisti, C', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Martinelli, G', 'Testoni, N', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Martelli, A M']","['Papa V', 'Tazzari PL', 'Chiarini F', 'Cappellini A', 'Ricci F', 'Billi AM', 'Evangelisti C', 'Ottaviani E', 'Martinelli G', 'Testoni N', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20071011,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404980 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404980 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jan;22(1):147-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404980.

The aim of this study was to generate a retrovirus packaging cell line that could be used for the production of large clinical batch vectors. Bicistronic vectors containing an internal ribosomal entry site followed by a selection gene were used to express Moloney murine leukemia gag-pol and amphotropic envelope viral proteins in HEK293 cells.

Similar titers were achieved after these cells were adapted to grow in suspension and serum-free media. Furthermore, using the same culture conditions viral titers proved to be stable for a 3-month culture period.

Better knowledge and understanding of the biology of ALL is necessary for re-classification and risk-adapted therapy. Microarray technology, developed over last two decades, provides a potential for revolutionary changes in the diagnosis and monitoring of malignant diseases. Hundreds of genomic sequences can be analyzed in a single microarray experiment. A large amount of data have been obtained by microarray technology in hematological malignancies. Gene expression profiles based on this technology are currently being extensively studied in patients with ALL, and new data are being obtained in specific subgroups of patients. New markers based on gene expression might be identified and used to stratify patients and to individualize therapy.

We hypothesized that HER2 positivity predicts a benefit from adjuvant doxorubicin doses above standard levels, from the addition of paclitaxel after adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide, or from both. METHODS: We randomly selected 1500 women from 3121 women with node-positive breast cancer who had been randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin (60, 75, or 90 mg per square meter of body-surface area) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter) for four cycles, followed by four cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg per square meter) or observation. Tissue blocks from 1322 of these 1500 women were available. Immunohistochemical analyses of these tissue specimens for HER2 with the CB11 monoclonal antibody against HER2 or with a polyclonal-antibody assay kit and fluorescence in situ hybridization for HER2 amplification were performed. RESULTS: No interaction was observed between HER2 positivity and doxorubicin doses above 60 mg per square meter. HER2 positivity was, however, associated with a significant benefit from paclitaxel. The interaction between HER2 positivity and the addition of paclitaxel to the treatment was associated with a hazard ratio for recurrence of 0.59 (P=0.01). Patients with a HER2-positive breast cancer benefited from paclitaxel, regardless of estrogen-receptor status, but paclitaxel did not benefit patients with HER2-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The expression or amplification, or both, of HER2 by a breast cancer is associated with a benefit from the addition of paclitaxel after adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin (<60 mg per square meter) plus cyclophosphamide in node-positive breast cancer, regardless of estrogen-receptor status. Patients with HER2-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer may gain little benefit from the administration of paclitaxel after adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide.","['Hayes, Daniel F', 'Thor, Ann D', 'Dressler, Lynn G', 'Weaver, Donald', 'Edgerton, Susan', 'Cowan, David', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Goldstein, Lori J', 'Martino, Silvana', 'Ingle, James N', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Norton, Larry', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford A', 'Ellis, Matthew J', 'Berry, Donald A']","['Hayes DF', 'Thor AD', 'Dressler LG', 'Weaver D', 'Edgerton S', 'Cowan D', 'Broadwater G', 'Goldstein LJ', 'Martino S', 'Ingle JN', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis CA', 'Ellis MJ', 'Berry DA']","['Breast Oncology Program,University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor 48109, USA. hayesdf@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*analysis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/10/12 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['357/15/1496 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa071167 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2007 Oct 11;357(15):1496-506. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa071167.,,,,,"['CA092461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Copyright 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Investigators'],"['N Engl J Med. 2007 Oct 11;357(15):1547-9.

SD' RNA results from alternative splicing of FL RNA. It is reverse-transcribed, and its DNA copy, integrated into the host genome, constitutes a splice donor-associated retroelement. FL and SD' RNAs share a common 5'-UTR that includes the packaging/dimerization signal (Psi). To investigate whether the mechanism of copackaging of these two RNAs involves RNA heterodimerization, we examined the spontaneous dimerization capacity of the two RNAs as large synthetic RNAs transcribed in vitro. We showed that SD' RNA not only formed homodimers with similar efficiency as the FL RNA, but that FL and SD' RNAs also formed FL/SD' heterodimers via Psi sequences. Comparison of the thermostabilities determined for these different dimeric species and competition experiments with Psi RNA fragments indicate the recruitment of similar dimer-linkage interactions within the Psi region. To validate these results, the dimeric state of the SD' RNA was analyzed in MLV particles. RNA capture assays performed with the FL RNA as bait revealed that SD', and not the host packageable U6 or 7SL RNAs, was associated with the FL RNA in virions. Heterodimerization of SD' RNA with FL RNA may argue for the recent concept of a nuclear dimerization at or near the site of transcription and raises the new hypothesis of RNA dimerization during splicing. Furthermore, FL/SD' heterodimerization may have leukemogenic consequences by influencing the pool of genomic dimers that will undergo recombinogenic template switching by reverse transcriptase.","['Maurel, Stephan', 'Houzet, Laurent', 'Garcia, Eric L', 'Telesnitsky, Alice', 'Mougel, Marylene']","['Maurel S', 'Houzet L', 'Garcia EL', 'Telesnitsky A', 'Mougel M']","[""Centre d'Etudes d'Agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologies pour la Sante (CPBS), CNRS UMR5236, UMI, UMII, IFR122, CS 69033, 34965 Montpellier, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071010,United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Dimerization', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Oligoribonucleotides/chemistry', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virion/genetics']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/01/19 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['rna.713807 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.713807 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2007 Dec;13(12):2266-76. doi: 10.1261/rna.713807.

Migration of donor-derived T cells into GVHD target organs plays an essential role in the development of GVHD. beta2 integrins are critically important for leukocyte extravasation through vascular endothelia and for T-cell activation. We asked whether CD18-deficient T cells would induce less GVHD while sparing the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. In murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation models, we found that recipients of CD18-/- donor T cells had significantly less GVHD morbidity and mortality compared with recipients of wild-type (WT) donor T cells. Analysis of alloreactivity showed that CD18-/- and WT T cells had comparable activation, expansion, and cytokine production in vivo. Reduced GVHD was associated with a significant decrease in donor T-cell infiltration of recipient intestine and with an overall decrease in pathologic scores in intestine and liver. Finally, we found that the in vivo GVL effect of CD18-/- donor T cells was largely preserved, because mortality of the recipients who received transplants of CD18-/- T cells plus tumor cells was greatly delayed or prevented. Our data suggest that strategies to target beta2 integrin have clinical potential to alleviate or prevent GVHD while sparing GVL activity.","['Liang, Yaming', 'Liu, Chen', 'Djeu, Julie Y', 'Zhong, Bin', 'Peters, Thorsten', 'Scharffetter-Kochanek, Karin', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Liang Y', 'Liu C', 'Djeu JY', 'Zhong B', 'Peters T', 'Scharffetter-Kochanek K', 'Anasetti C', 'Yu XZ']","['H.

The antiapoptotic BCR signal has been associated with prolonged activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, which are key regulators of survival and proliferation in various cell types. To further define the relative contribution of the Akt and ERK kinases in regulating CLL B-cell survival, we introduced constitutively active mutants of Akt and MEK in primary CLL B cells and evaluated changes in the expression of relevant pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. Sustained activation of Akt resulted in increased leukemic cell viability and increased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), thus largely recapitulating the effects of sustained BCR stimulation. Constitutively active MEK2 also up-regulated XIAP, but did not show a significant impact on leukemic cell survival. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 by siRNA treatment induced rapid and potent apoptosis in CLL B cells and blocked the antiapoptotic effect of sustained BCR stimulation, whereas down-regulation of Bcl-xL and XIAP did not affect leukemic cell viability. These data demonstrate that Akt and Mcl-1 are major components of a survival pathway that can be activated in CLL B cells by antigen stimulation.","['Longo, Pablo G', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Sica, Simona', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Longo PG', 'Laurenti L', 'Gobessi S', 'Sica S', 'Leone G', 'Efremov DG']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Molecular Hematology Group, Campus A.

Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (purinergic receptor antagonist) or apyrase (ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme) reduced the Ca(2+) signals in neurites, indicating that ATP released from activated mast cells was one of important mediators to activate nerves.","['Suzuki, Ryo', 'Furuno, Tadahide', 'Okamoto, Keisuke', 'Teshima, Reiko', 'Nakanishi, Mamoru']","['Suzuki R', 'Furuno T', 'Okamoto K', 'Teshima R', 'Nakanishi M']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya 467-8603, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071024,Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histamine/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neurites/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Serotonin/pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology', 'Time Factors']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-5728(07)00304-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jneuroim.2007.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 2007 Dec;192(1-2):49-56. doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2007.09.013.

Each PML-ND cradles a delicate scaffold of nucleoproteins, many of which can trigger the apoptotic death cascade if disrupted. Given their place in integrating stress and death, PML-NDs are obvious targets for excision from injury pathways by viruses and cancers. Viruses express proteins dedicated to silencing the PML-ND network and their failure can presage the suppression of viral replication. To understand how PML-NDs protect the cell from stress we must discover those damage pathways with which they connect. Such data will reveal the panoply of signal pathways lost in PML null cells and the extent to which infection and cancer can desensitise the cell to therapeutic intervention. A convenient and sensitive method with which to detect PML-ND stress induction is its biophysical reorganisation, as well defined dose responsive modifications of PML protein accompany damage recognition. The experiments that we present in this manuscript arose from an observation that lipid mediated transfection of plasmid DNA triggered a dramatic modification of PML-NDs that was identical to that seen following their recognition of DNA damage. In later experiments, we identified lipoprotein and IL-6 as potential mediators of this response. Collectively these data are the first to link an endotoxin component and IL-6 to the PML-ND compartment and, given the role of PML in cell fate, suggest increasing complexity at the interface of immunity and carcinogenesis.","['Laredj, L N', 'Ferguson, B J', 'Rich, T']","['Laredj LN', 'Ferguson BJ', 'Rich T']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB21QP, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071024,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Reaction', 'DNA Damage', 'Endotoxins', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology/*pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', '*Stress, Physiological', 'Virus Diseases']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(07)00713-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2007.08.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Mar;45(5):1477-84. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.08.019.

METHODS: dsRNA analogue polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (PolyIC), retroviral vector containing 40 bp of bcr/abl fusion gene sequence (RV-40AS), RV-40AS and 2-aminopurine (2-AP), and retroviral vector containing green fluorescent protein sequence (RV-GFP) were transfected or infected into K562 cells respectively; ECV304 cells were used as control. Cell proliferation was determined by cell counting, MTT assay, and semisolid clone formation experiment. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of PKR, phosphated PKR (p-PKR), eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha (eIF2alpha), and phosphated eIF2alpha (p-eIF2alpha) was detected by Western blot. Total protein synthesis was studied by 3H-leucine incorporation. RESULTS: polyIC inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and ECV304 cells unspecifically, while RV-40AS only inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells specifically. 2-AP blocked the inhibitory effect of RV-40AS on the proliferation of K562 cells. The S phase proportion was significantly lower in polyIC-and RV-40AS-treated K562 cells than in untreated cells [(37.26+/-2.35)% and (31.48+/-3.65)% vs. (58.53+/-5.42)%, P<0.05], while the G0/G1 phase proportion was significantly higher in polyIC-and RV-40AS-treated cells than in untreated cells [(50.97+/-2.18)% and (57.47+/-3.61)% vs. (36.44+/-4.20)%, P<0.05]. The expression of p-PKR and p-eIF2alpha in polyIC-and RV-40AS-treated K562 cells and polyIC-treated ECV304 cells was obviously up-regulated.

The detection rate of clonal chromosomal aberrations was enhanced to 59.5% by combined application of multiplex RT-PCR and karyotype analysis. CONCLUSION: Multiplex RT-PCR combined with karyotype analysis can improve the detection rate of clonal chromosomal aberrations in AML.","['Huang, Liang', 'Li, Chun-Rui', 'Zhang, Heng', 'Sun, Li-Shi', 'Liu, Wen-Li', 'Zhou, Jian-Feng']","['Huang L', 'Li CR', 'Zhang H', 'Sun LS', 'Liu WL', 'Zhou JF']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology,Wuhan, Hubei, 430030, PR China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2007/10/12 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X2007091029 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2007 Sep;26(9):1029-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously have proved that curcumin was a new member of the histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors, while constitutive nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is believed to be a crucial event for enhanced proliferation and survival of malignant cells. Here, we investigate the effect of curcumin on the activation of NF-kappaB signal molecule in Raji cells to explore its relationship with HDACs or p300/CREB binding protein (CBP). Curcumin presented striking proliferation inhibition potency on Raji cells in vitro, with the IC(50) value for 24 hr being 25 micromol/l. Significant decreases in the amounts of p300, HDAC1 and HDAC3 were detected after treatment with curcumin. These suppressing effects were more pronounced when the administered dose increased. The protection degradation of HDAC1 and p300 by MG-132 could be partially reversed by curcumin. Furthermore, curcumin could also prevent degradation of I kappaB alpha and inhibit nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB/p65 subunit, as well as expression of Notch 1, induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results suggest that the depressive effect of curcumin on NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway may be mediated via the various components of the HDACs and p300/Notch 1 signal molecules, and may represent a new remedy for acute leukaemia.","['Chen, Yan', 'Shu, Wenxiu', 'Chen, Weihua', 'Wu, Qing', 'Liu, Hongli', 'Cui, Guohui']","['Chen Y', 'Shu W', 'Chen W', 'Wu Q', 'Liu H', 'Cui G']","['Department of Haematology Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. yanchen@public.wh.hb.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071009,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'CREB-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTO142 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00142.x [doi]']",ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2007 Dec;101(6):427-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00142.x.

It was the most common cause of death among children receiving chemotherapy prior to the inclusion of PCP prophylaxis as part of standard care for children with leukemia. The incidence of PCP has decreased significantly since initiation of prophylaxis; however, breakthrough cases continue to occur. Hematologic malignancies, brain tumors necessitating prolonged corticosteroid therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prolonged neutropenia, and lymphopenia are the most important risk factors for PCP in children not infected with HIV. Of children with leukemia, 15-20% may develop PCP in the absence of prophylaxis. Infection with P. jiroveci occurs early in life in most individuals. However, clinically apparent disease occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised persons. Dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever are the most common presenting symptoms of PCP. Chest radiography and high-resolution CT scans of the chest demonstrate a characteristic ground-glass pattern. Induced sputum analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage are the diagnostic procedures of choice. Gomori's methenamine-silver stain, Geimsa or Wright's stain, and monoclonal immunofluorescent antibody stains are most commonly used to make a diagnosis. However, identification of P. jiroveci DNA using polymerase chain reaction assays in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is more sensitive. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ; cotrimoxazole) is the recommended drug for the treatment of PCP. Patients who are intolerant of TMP-SMZ or who have not responded to treatment after 5-7 days of therapy with TMP-SMZ should be treated with pentamidine. A short course of corticosteroids is recommended for moderate to severe cases of PCP within the first 72 hours after diagnosis. Mutations in the dihydropteroate synthetase gene may confer resistance to TMP-SMZ; however, the clinical relevance of these mutations is not well established. TMP-SMZ is the most commonly used agent for prophylaxis. Myelosuppression is the most important adverse effect of TMP-SMZ and the most frequent cause for choosing alternative prophylactic agents in children undergoing chemotherapy. Alternative agents for chemoprophylaxis include dapsone, aerosolized pentamidine, and atovaquone. Alternative prophylactic agents must be used in patients developing myelosuppression secondary to TMP-SMZ or dapsone.","['Shankar, Sadhna M', 'Nania, Joseph J']","['Shankar SM', 'Nania JJ']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-6310, USA. sadhnamd@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,,IM,"['Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Pneumocystis carinii/*drug effects/physiology', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*complications/*drug therapy/microbiology/prevention & control']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/01/12 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['953 [pii]', '10.2165/00148581-200709050-00003 [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2007;9(5):301-9. doi: 10.2165/00148581-200709050-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct clinicopathological ALL entities have been identified, resulting in the adoption of risk-oriented treatment approaches. Advances in ALL therapy have led to long-term survival rates of >80% in children. However, only approximate, approximately 30-40% of adults achieve long-term disease-free survival. Contemporary ALL treatment programmes include induction, intensified consolidation, maintenance phases and CNS prophylaxis. The optimal treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients requires the addition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, whereas allogeneic stem-cell transplantation remains the preferred approach for high-risk patients in first remission. Since only approximate, approximately 38% of adult ALL patients are free of disease 5 years after diagnosis and the outcome of salvage chemotherapy is very poor (complete remission rates of 20-30%, median survival of 3-6 months), novel agents are desperately required.

The throughput of the analysis, however, is still limited due to our inability to perform parallel and quantitative detection of cells captured on the array. To address this limitation, we employed here an imaging technique based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR has been frequently used to monitor capture of proteins on antibody microarrays, while few cases were reported for capture of cells. Antibody arrays were prepared through the photopatterning of an alkanethiol monolayer on a gold-evaporated glass plate and the subsequent immobilization of various antibodies onto 4-9 separate spots created by photopatterning. A glass slip was mounted onto the array with a thin spacer to construct a parallel-plate chamber. Leukemia cells were injected into the chamber to conduct a binding assay, while refractive index changes at the vicinity of the array surface were monitored by SPR imaging. We observed that SPR signals were intensified on specific antibody spots but not on nonspecific spots. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the observed SPR signals were attributed to cell deformations caused by multivalent interactions with immobilized antibody, which effectively elevated the refractive index of a medium phase within an evanescent field. This effect could be suitably utilized to monitor quantitatively cell binding to multiple spots from a heterogeneous cell population.","['Kato, Koichi', 'Ishimuro, Toshinari', 'Arima, Yusuke', 'Hirata, Isao', 'Iwata, Hiroo']","['Kato K', 'Ishimuro T', 'Arima Y', 'Hirata I', 'Iwata H']","['Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071010,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Time Factors']",2007/10/12 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac071548s [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2007 Nov 15;79(22):8616-23. doi: 10.1021/ac071548s.

The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of dexamethasone exposure on sleep and fatigue in pediatric patients with ALL. METHODS: One hundred pediatric patients with low-risk or standard-risk ALL were enrolled on 1 of 3 protocols (St. Jude Total XV, Children's Oncology Group [COG] 9904, or COG 9905) at 3 institutions. The mean age of the cohort was 9.24 +/- 3.23 years (range, 5.03-18.14 years). The majority of patients were white (79%) males (62%) with standard-risk ALL (63%). The cohort was divided into 4 subgroups: St. Jude low-risk, St. Jude standard-risk, COG low-risk, and COG standard-risk. Patients wore a wrist actigraph to monitor sleep activity during 2 consecutive 5-day periods: During the first period, they did not receive dexamethasone; and, during the second period, they did. Patients and their parents completed fatigue instruments on Days 2 and 5 of each period, and parents completed sleep diaries. RESULTS: Actual sleep minutes, sleep duration, total daily nap minutes, and fatigue increased significantly during the dexamethasone treatment for 3 to 4 of the subgroups. Total daily nap minutes increased significantly for both standard-risk groups during the dexamethasone treatment. Parents reported significant increases in their child's nighttime awakenings, restless sleep, and nap time during dexamethasone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone treatment during continuation therapy for childhood ALL significantly and adversely altered sleep and fatigue, confirming that sleep and fatigue are behavioral responses to dexamethasone.","['Hinds, Pamela S', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'Gattuso, Jami S', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Tong, Xin', 'Jones, Heather', 'West, Nancy', 'McCarthy, Kathy S', 'Sadeh, Avi', 'Ash, Monica', 'Fernandez, Cheryl', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Hinds PS', 'Hockenberry MJ', 'Gattuso JS', 'Srivastava DK', 'Tong X', 'Jones H', 'West N', 'McCarthy KS', 'Sadeh A', 'Ash M', 'Fernandez C', 'Pui CH']","[""Division of Nursing Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. pam.hinds@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fatigue/*chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Sleep/*drug effects']",2007/10/11 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/10/11 09:00'],"['2007/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23039 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Nov 15;110(10):2321-30. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23039.,,,,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NR007610/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

(-)Gossypol inhibited cell growth, promoted apoptosis, induced DeltaPsim loss, and cytochrome C release. Furthermore, (-)gossypol had a synergistic inhibitory effect on growth in K562 cells when combined with imatinib. Enhanced apoptosis, cytochrome C release, and caspase 3 cleavage as well as noticeable decrease of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL were observed in K562 cells treated with both (-)gossypol and imatinib.

Therefore, the effect of BMSCs on both proliferation and apoptosis characteristics of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells was investigated as well as the effect of BMSCs exposure to chemotherapy on the stromal supportive capacity. Leukemic HL-60 and primary AML cells were either untreated or treated with cytarabine and subsequently cultured for 3-4 days, in the presence or absence of untreated or cytarabine-treated BMSCs. The effect on proliferation and apoptosis was investigated with flow cytometry using CFSE labeling and Syto16 and 7AAD staining. BMSCs were found to maintain cytarabine-exposed primary AML cells by protection against spontaneous apoptosis. Accordingly, an increase in phosphorylated-AKT and Bcl-2 expression was found. Concomitant exposure of BMSCs to cytarabine resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of protective capacity of BMSCs. Thus, inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis of leukemic cells mediated by phosphorylation of AKT/Bcl-2 pathway results in protection of leukemic cells by BMSCs, which decreases after BMSCs exposure to chemotherapy. Targeting both the tumor cells and intervening in their interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment may thus affect clinical outcome in AML.","['Moshaver, Bijan', 'van der Pol, Marjolein A', 'Westra, August H', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan']","['Moshaver B', 'van der Pol MA', 'Westra AH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Zweegman S', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', '*Bone Marrow', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/10/11 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2007/10/11 09:00'],"['2007/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['782925669 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701593636 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jan;49(1):134-48. doi: 10.1080/10428190701593636.,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jan;49(1):17-8.

We generated a new set of tumors from nine AKXD RI strains selected for their propensity to develop B-cell tumors, the most common type of human hematopoietic cancers. We employed a PCR technique called viral insertion site amplification (VISA) to rapidly isolate genomic sequence at the site of provirus insertion. Here we describe 550 VISA sequence tags (VSTs) that identify 74 common insertion sites (CISs), of which 21 have not been identified previously. Several suspected proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes lie near CISs, providing supportive evidence for their roles in cancer. Furthermore, numerous previously uncharacterized genes lie near CISs, providing a pool of candidate disease genes for future research. Pathway analysis of candidate genes identified several signaling pathways as common and powerful routes to blood cancer, including Notch, E-protein, NFkappaB, and Ras signaling. Misregulation of several Notch signaling genes was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Our data suggest that analyses of insertional mutagenesis on a single genetic background are biased toward the identification of cooperating mutations. This tumor collection represents the most comprehensive study of the genetics of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma development in mice.

Arpp/Ankrd2 is localized mainly in the I-band of striated muscle. However, it has recently been reported that Arpp/Ankrd2 can interact with nuclear proteins, such as premyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), p53 and YB-1 in vitro. In this study, to determine whether nuclear accumulation of Arpp/Ankrd2 actually occurs, we performed an immunohistochemical investigation of gastrocnemius muscles that had been injured by injection of cardiotoxin or contact with dry ice. We found that Arpp/Ankrd2 accumulated in the nuclei of myofibers located adjacent to severely damaged myofibers after muscle injury. Double-labeled immunohistochemistry revealed that Arpp/Ankrd2 accumulated in the nuclei of sarcomere-damaged myofibers. Furthermore, we found that Arpp/Ankrd2 tended to be localized in euchromatin where genes are transcriptionally activated. Based on these findings, we suggest that Arpp/Ankrd2 may translocate from the I-band to the nucleus in response to muscle damage and may participate in the regulation of gene expression.","['Tsukamoto, Yoshiyuki', 'Hijiya, Naoki', 'Yano, Shinji', 'Yokoyama, Shigeo', 'Nakada, Chisato', 'Uchida, Tomohisa', 'Matsuura, Keiko', 'Moriyama, Masatsugu']","['Tsukamoto Y', 'Hijiya N', 'Yano S', 'Yokoyama S', 'Nakada C', 'Uchida T', 'Matsuura K', 'Moriyama M']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Yufu-city, Oita, 879-5593, Japan. tuka@med.oita-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071010,Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,"['0 (Ankrd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cardiotoxins)', '0 (Dry Ice)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiotoxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dry Ice/adverse effects', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects/*injuries/*pathology']",2007/10/11 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2007/10/11 09:00'],"['2007/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00418-007-0348-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 2008 Jan;129(1):55-64. doi: 10.1007/s00418-007-0348-9.

The lymphocytes present characteristic citoplasmatic projections and are positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Immunophenotyping is necessary to identify the co expression of CD103, CD25, CD11c associated with a typical B-cell clonally pattern and to make a differential diagnosis from other indolent malignancies. Despite the indolent clinical course, treatment is required to resolve symptoms related to splenomegaly and to reduce the incidence of severe infections that are the major complications and a common cause of death. In the past the treatment was only able to resolve the symptoms. In the revised literature, purine analog have been identified as the treatment of choice for this disease. Cladribrine (2-CdA) is able to induce more than 80% of complete remission and is also effective in relapsed patients. Rituximab after 2-CdA treatment can obtain a molecular response in most cases.

The objective of the study was to analyze of the type and incidence of infectious complications during neutropenia after HDT and autologous HSCT with respect to risk factors related to stem cell transplant setting in patients treated for hematological malignancies in a single center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total number of 314 patients diagnosed for Hodgkin's disease (HD), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were included in the study. Analysis of risk factors and outcome of infections after HDT and autologous HSCT was performed. RESULTS: Infectious complications during neutropenia after HDT occurred in 92.3% patients. Microbiologically documented infections (MDI) accounted for 38.9% of febrile episodes, clinically documented infections (CDI) for 9.3%, and fever of unknown origin (FUO) for 51.7% cases. Median time to defervescence with antibiotic therapy was seven days for FUO and nine days for documented infections (p < 0.001). Duration of infection correlated with the length of very severe neutropenia (p < 0.001). Response to first-line antibiotic therapy was seen in 34% patients. Infections were fatal in 12 (3.8%) patients. The highest probability of infection was observed for ALL and AML patients, especially these conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI). CONCLUSION: Patients at high risk of infection after autologous HSCT were identified as those with acute leukemia and those after conditioning with TBI, all with prolonged neutropenia. We suggest that newer prophylactic strategies should be administered to these groups of patients.","['Gil, L', 'Styczynski, J', 'Komarnicki, M']","['Gil L', 'Styczynski J', 'Komarnicki M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Medical Sciences, ul.

It is a specific agonist for retinoic acid receptor alpha/beta. Compared to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a natural retinoid indicated for a first-line treatment of APL, tamibarotene is chemically more stable and several times more potent as an inducer of differentiation in promyelocytic leukemia cells. In contrast to ATRA, whose plasma concentration declines considerably during daily administration, tamibarotene sustains plasma level probably due to a lower affinity for cellular retinoic acid binding protein. Furthermore, adverse side effects were milder than those of ATRA in clinical trials. Clinical trials held in Japan showed that tamibarotene had efficacy in APL patients who had relapsed from ATRA-induced complete remission. Recently, better understanding of the various mechanisms of action of retinoids has stimulated great interest in its potential use for treatment of various diseases. Tamibarotene is being investigated for treatment of multiple myeloma and Crohn's disease in clinical trials.

Knowledge of the pattern of deaths from these neoplasms is therefore desirable. OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern of deaths from paediatric malignancies, compare this to morbidity figures and provide baseline data for planning child care services. METHODS: A 10 year retrospective survey of autopsy cases of paediatric malignancies at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital Mortuary was carried out based on autopsy files form January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999 RESULTS: A total of 252 cases of childhood malignant tumours were retrieved, 139 males and 113 females with a male to female ratio of 1.2:1. The most common malignancy was lymphoma forming 54% of cases and almost all of Non-Hodgkin's type. Non-Burkitts type (29%) was the commonest followed by Burkitts (24%) and Hodgkin's disease only one percent. The lymphomas were followed by central nervous system (CNS) tumours (13%), nephroblastomas(10.3%) leukemias (6.7%) hepatic tumours (4%) and sarcomas (2.6%). Less common tumours were Neuroblastomas (2.4%) and retinoblastomas (2%). CONCLUSION: Overall the pattern of deaths from paediatric malignancies followed the pattern of relative incidence in morbidity figures from Ghana and the subregion except for a relatively higher proportion of deaths from CNS tumours and a lower proportion from sarcomas. The pattern of cancer deaths seen in this study is similar to that seen in advanced countries except that lymphomas replace leukemia as the commonest cause of death.","['Gyasi, Rk', 'Tettey, Y']","['Gyasi R', 'Tettey Y']","['Departments of Pathology, University of Ghana Medical School, P.

We assessed whether characteristics of patients with CLL and SLL differ in ways other than the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and evaluated treatment outcomes and prognostic factors. METHODS: We searched the electronic database for patients with CLL or SLL who presented to The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) between 1985 and 2005. We reviewed patient records to determine presenting characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes. Cox models using training and validation sets of patients and resampling methods were used to develop a model predicting survival. RESULTS: Among 2,126 consecutive CLL/SLL patients, 312 (15%) had ALC less than 5 x 10(9)/L. Patients with ALC less than 5 x 10(9)/L had lower rates of cytogenetic abnormalities (P = .0002) and higher rates of CD38-positive results (P = .0002) and had mutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene status (P = .034). Rates of response, survival, and failure-free survival (FFS) were not different among ALC groups. Regimens that included rituximab and a nucleoside analog were associated with superior rates of response and FFS compared with other therapies, irrespective of ALC. Deletion 17p or 6q with or without other cytogenetic abnormalities, age at least 60 years, beta2-microglobulin at least 2 mg/L, albumin less than 3.5 g/dL, and creatinine at least 1.6 mg/dL were each found to independently predict shorter survival and formed the basis of a scoring system. CONCLUSION: Patients with CLL or SLL can be treated similarly. A new prognostic score is proposed.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia M', 'Wen, Sijin', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'McLaughlin, Peter', 'Wierda, William G', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Manning, John', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Mai, Chinh V', 'Rodriguez, Alma M', 'Hess, Mark', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Wen S', ""O'Brien S"", 'McLaughlin P', 'Wierda WG', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Faderl S', 'Manning J', 'Lerner S', 'Mai CV', 'Rodriguez AM', 'Hess M', 'Do KA', 'Freireich EJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. atsimber@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)'],IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Texas', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/10/11 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/10/11 09:00'],"['2007/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/29/4648 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.09.4508 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 10;25(29):4648-56. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.4508.,,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some recent data suggest a benefit to adolescents with certain cancers when treated at pediatric centers or on pediatric protocols. We used a population-based registry to determine the site of care of children, adolescents, and young adults (age 0 to 24 years) with newly diagnosed cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the Utah Cancer Registry 1994 to 2000, new malignant cases in patients aged 0 to 24 years were chosen; data including diagnosis, home ZIP code and sites of oncologic care were abstracted. Distance between home ZIP code and Primary Children's Medical Center (PCMC; Salt Lake City, Utah), the state's sole site of pediatric oncology care, was determined. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of Utah 15- to 19-year-olds with cancer were never seen by a PCMC oncologist. Even among this narrow age range, utilization of the pediatric center dropped with each additional year of age. Not unexpectedly, few of those with epithelial malignancies in this age group were seen at PCMC. But surprisingly, 47% of the older adolescents with leukemia, 66% with brain tumors, and 71% with lymphoma never saw a pediatric oncologist. After consideration of age and diagnosis, distance the patient lived from PCMC had a negligible effect on the likelihood of an adolescent being seen there. CONCLUSION: The referral of adolescents with cancer to a pediatric oncology center diminishes greatly with age, and is moderately influenced by diagnosis and minimally by distance from center. Further study should investigate reasons for referral patterns, and impact on outcomes.","['Albritton, Karen H', 'Wiggins, Charles H', 'Nelson, Harold E', 'Weeks, Jane C']","['Albritton KH', 'Wiggins CH', 'Nelson HE', 'Weeks JC']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. karen_albritton@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/methods/organization & administration', 'Medicine', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Registries', 'Specialization', 'Utah']",2007/10/11 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/10/11 09:00'],"['2007/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/29/4616 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.4103 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 10;25(29):4616-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.4103.,,,,,"['N01-PC-35138/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35141/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 10;25(29):4522-3.

This study examines access to cancer care and survival outcomes based on age, race, and type of cancer in patients in Georgia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 1,751 cancer patients aged 0 to 19 years, diagnosed between 1998 and 2002, in the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry, which identified patients who were treated at one of five Georgia pediatric cancer centers (Children's Oncology Group [COG] members) at any point in their treatment. Data were further analyzed for age at diagnosis, race, county of residence, and 5-year survival. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of patients aged 0 to 14 years and 36% of those aged 15 to 19 years were treated at a COG institution. Twenty-five percent of all patients were of African descent, with 75.4% of black versus 70.3% of white patients (age 0 to 19 years) treated at a COG institution (P < .01); 97.1% of other minorities were treated at a COG institution (P < .05). The 5-year actuarial survival rates for more pediatric-specific cancers were significantly lower in all leukemias (75.1% v 46.4%; P = .0015), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia specifically (86.3% v 53.3%; P < .05) for patients not treated at a COG institution. Actuarial survival rates were much lower for blacks than whites in all cancers as a whole (70% v 82%; P < .001) and for many specific subtypes. CONCLUSION: Adolescent-aged patients are less likely to be referred to a COG institution, potentially exposing them to worse outcomes in some cancer subtypes. Reassuringly, minority populations are receiving adequate access to pediatric cancer care; unfortunately their survival rates are lower.","['Howell, Della L', 'Ward, Kevin C', 'Austin, Harland D', 'Young, John L', 'Woods, William G']","['Howell DL', 'Ward KC', 'Austin HD', 'Young JL', 'Woods WG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.

In the latter phase, expression and function of specific RBPs are aberrantly regulated at transcriptional or posttranslational levels by the constitutive kinase activity of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein. As a result, altered expression/function of RBPs leads to increased resistance to apoptotic stimuli, enhanced survival, growth advantage, and differentiation arrest of CD34+ progenitors from patients in CML blast crisis. Here, we identify the mRNAs bound to the hnRNP-A1, hnRNP-E2, hnRNP-K, and La/SSB RBPs in BCR/ABLtransformed myeloid cells. Interestingly, we found that the mRNA encoding the transcription factor E2F3 associates to hnRNP-A1 through a conserved binding site located in the E2F3 3' untranslated region (UTR). E2F3 levels were up-regulated in CML-BCCD34+ in a BCR/ABL kinase- and hnRNP-A1 shuttling-dependent manner. Moreover, by using shRNA-mediated E2F3 knock-down and BCR/ABL-transduced lineage-negative bone marrow cells from E2F3+/+ and E2F3-/- mice, we show that E2F3 expression is important for BCR/ABL clonogenic activity and in vivo leukemogenic potential. Thus, the complexity of the mRNA/RBP network, together with the discovery of E2F3 as an hnRNP-A1-regulated factor, outlines the relevant role played by RBPs in posttranscriptional regulation of CML development and progression.","['Eiring, Anna M', 'Neviani, Paolo', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Oaks, Joshua J', 'Chang, Ji Suk', 'Notari, Mario', 'Willis, William', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Leone, Gustavo W', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Eiring AM', 'Neviani P', 'Santhanam R', 'Oaks JJ', 'Chang JS', 'Notari M', 'Willis W', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Volinia S', 'Marcucci G', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Leone GW', 'Perrotti D']","['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071009,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (E2F3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F3 protein, human)', '0 (E2f3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics/*metabolism"", 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'E2F3 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/10/11 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/11 09:00'],"['2007/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48501-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-090472 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):816-28. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-090472.

This off-target effect can be explained by inhibitory effects on JAK2. Apoptosis induction coupled to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization occurred independently from phenotypic differentiation. In apoptosis-sensitive AML cells, erlotinib caused a rapid (within less than 1 hour) nucleocytoplasmic translocation of nucleophosmin-1 (NPM-1) and p14(ARF). Apoptosis-insensitive myeloblasts failed to manifest this translocation yet became sensitive to apoptosis induction by erlotinib when NPM-1 was depleted by RNA interference. Moreover, erlotinib reduced the growth of xenografted human AML cells in vivo. Erlotinib also killed CD34(+) bone marrow blasts from MDS and AML patients while sparing normal CD34(+) progenitors. This ex vivo therapeutic effect was once more associated with the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of NPM-1 and p14(ARF). One patient afflicted with both MDS and non-small cell lung cancer manifested hematologic improvement in response to erlotinib.

Chromosomal translocations involving the HAT-encoded region are also associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Here we present the x-ray crystal structure of the MOZ HAT domain and related biochemical studies. We find that the HAT domain contains a central region that is structurally and functionally conserved with the yeast MYST HAT protein Esa1, but contains more divergent N- and C-terminal regions harboring a TFIIIA-type zinc finger and helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs. Solution DNA-binding and acetyltransferase activity assays, in concert with mutagenesis, confirm that the MOZ HAT domain binds strongly to DNA through the zinc finger and helix-turn-helix motifs and that DNA binding and catalysis are not mutually exclusive. Consistent with the DNA-binding properties of MOZ, we also show that MOZ is able to acetylate nucleosomes and free histones equally well, whereas other HATs prefer free histones.

In contrast, it has been shown that this transcription factor is commonly activated in breast cancer cells, although what causes this effect remains unknown. Here we have tested the hypothesis that locally produced LIF can be responsible for Stat3 activation in mouse mammary tumors. METHODS: The studies were performed in different tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic mammary cells. The expression of LIF and LIF receptor was tested by RT-PCR analysis. In tumors, LIF and Stat3 proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, whereas Stat3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 expression and phosphorylation were studied by Western blot analysis. A LIF-specific blocking antibody was used to determine whether this cytokine was responsible for Stat3 phosphorylation induced by conditioned medium. Specific pharmacological inhibitors (PD98059 and Stat3ip) that affect ERK1/2 and Stat3 activation were used to study their involvement in LIF-induced effects. To analyze cell survival, assays with crystal violet were performed. RESULTS: High levels of LIF expression and activated Stat3 were found in mammary tumors growing in vivo and in their primary cultures. We found a single mouse mammary tumor cell line, LM3, that showed low levels of activated Stat3. Incidentally, these cells also showed very little expression of LIF receptor. This suggested that autocrine/paracrine LIF would be responsible for Stat3 activation in mouse mammary tumors. This hypothesis was confirmed by the ability of conditioned medium of mammary tumor primary cultures to induce Stat3 phosphorylation, activity that was prevented by pretreatment with LIF-blocking antibody. Besides, we found that LIF increased tumor cell viability. Interestingly, blocking Stat3 activation enhanced this effect in mammary tumor cells. CONCLUSION: LIF is overexpressed in mouse mammary tumors, where it acts as the main Stat3 activator. Interestingly, the positive LIF effect on tumor cell viability is not dependent on Stat3 activation, which inhibits tumor cell survival as it does in normal mammary epithelium.","['Quaglino, Ana', 'Schere-Levy, Carolina', 'Romorini, Leonardo', 'Meiss, Roberto P', 'Kordon, Edith C']","['Quaglino A', 'Schere-Levy C', 'Romorini L', 'Meiss RP', 'Kordon EC']","['IFIBYNE (CONICET), Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2007/10/11 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/11 09:00'],"['2006/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['bcr1777 [pii]', '10.1186/bcr1777 [doi]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2007;9(5):R69. doi: 10.1186/bcr1777.,,,PMC2242666,,"['R01 TW006212/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R01TW006212/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), an orally bioavailable calcium influx and signal transduction inhibitor, is equally effective in inhibiting the proliferation and bcr-abl dependent- and independent-signaling pathways in imatinib-resistant CML cells. CAI inhibits phosphorylation of cellular proteins including STAT5 and CrkL at concentrations that induce apoptosis in IM-resistant CML cells. The combination of imatinib and CAI also down-regulated bcr-abl protein levels.

Interestingly, a distinct phenotype is noted at the earlier stages of the disease, with an unusual perivascular cuff of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, which was found surrounding the superior and inferior arcades in the retina. TOPORS is a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and localizes in the nucleus in speckled loci that are associated with promyelocytic leukemia bodies. The ubiquitous nature of TOPORS expression and a lack of mutant protein in patients are highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency, rather than a dominant negative effect, as the molecular mechanism of the disease and make rescue of the clinical phenotype amenable to somatic gene therapy.","['Chakarova, Christina F', 'Papaioannou, Myrto G', 'Khanna, Hemant', 'Lopez, Irma', 'Waseem, Naushin', 'Shah, Amna', 'Theis, Torsten', 'Friedman, James', 'Maubaret, Cecilia', 'Bujakowska, Kinga', 'Veraitch, Brotati', 'Abd El-Aziz, Mai M', 'Prescott, De Quincy', 'Parapuram, Sunil K', 'Bickmore, Wendy A', 'Munro, Peter M G', 'Gal, Andreas', 'Hamel, Christian P', 'Marigo, Valeria', 'Ponting, Chris P', 'Wissinger, Bernd', 'Zrenner, Eberhart', 'Matter, Karl', 'Swaroop, Anand', 'Koenekoop, Robert K', 'Bhattacharya, Shomi S']","['Chakarova CF', 'Papaioannou MG', 'Khanna H', 'Lopez I', 'Waseem N', 'Shah A', 'Theis T', 'Friedman J', 'Maubaret C', 'Bujakowska K', 'Veraitch B', 'Abd El-Aziz MM', 'Prescott de Q', 'Parapuram SK', 'Bickmore WA', 'Munro PM', 'Gal A', 'Hamel CP', 'Marigo V', 'Ponting CP', 'Wissinger B', 'Zrenner E', 'Matter K', 'Swaroop A', 'Koenekoop RK', 'Bhattacharya SS']","['Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070926,United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TOPORS protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pedigree', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/*blood supply/*pathology', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/10/10 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/10 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9297(07)63883-X [pii]', '10.1086/521953 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 2007 Nov;81(5):1098-103. doi: 10.1086/521953.

Here, we elucidated the sequence of death responses to C-1311 in human leukemia MOLT4 cells using drug concentration (30 nM) that causes near complete cell growth inhibition at 48 h. Early (6-12 h) responses included transient accumulation of cells at the G2/M border followed by also transient rise in several mitotic markers. Mitotic attempts were largely abnormal, resulting in numerous multinucleated cells (peaking at 24-39 h and declining markedly at later times). These events, indicative of mitotic catastrophe, were not associated with immediate cell death. The fraction of necrotic cells did not exceed 3%. Also, the classical manifestations of apoptosis were marginal at 24 h and their progression clearly followed the decline in the fraction of mitotic and multinucleated cells. Quantification of several apoptotic markers (including phosphatidylserine externalization, apoptotic DNA breaks, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, and cell membrane integrity) showed a considerable progression and the shift from early to late apoptosis at later times. At 72 h, >80% of cells were apoptotic.

The fist study (using probe ABM) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) membranes of 97 Chernobyl clean-up workers from Latvia was conducted in 1997. Now we repeatedly examine the same (n = 54) individuals in dynamics. ABM spectral parameters in PBMC suspension, fluorescence anisotropy and blood plasma albumin characteristics were recorded. In 1997 screening showed 5 different patterns of fluorescence spectra, from which in 2007 we obtained only two. These patterns of spectra had never been previously seen in healthy individuals or patients with tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc., examined by us. Patterns of ABM fluorescence spectra are associated with membrane anisotropy and conformational changes of blood plasma albumin. We observed that in dynamics 1997-2007 the lipid compartment of the membrane became more fluid while the lipid-protein interface became more rigid. The use of probe ANS and albumin auto-fluorescence allowed show conformational alterations in Chernobyl clean-up workers blood plasma. It is necessary to note that all investigated parameters significantly differ in observed groups of patients. These findings reinforce our understanding that that the cell membrane is a significant biological target of radiation. The role of the membrane in the expression and course of cell damage after radiation exposure must be considered.

Unfortunately, successful therapy has come with a price, as significant morbidity can result from neurological affects which harm the brain and spinal cord. The expectation and hope is that chemotherapy, as a primary means of CNS therapy, will result in acceptable disease control with less CNS morbidity than has been observed with combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy over the past several decades. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this review we discuss the poignant, historical aspects of CNS leukemia therapy, outline current methods of systemic and CNS leukemia therapy, and present imaging findings we have encountered in childhood leukemia patients with a variety of acute neurological conditions. A major objective of our research is to understand the neuroimaging correlates of acute and chronic effects of cancer and therapy. Specific features related to CNS leukemia and associated short-term toxicities, both disease- and therapy-related, are emphasized in this review with the specific neuroimaging findings. Specific CNS findings are similarly important when treating acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and details of leukemic involvement and toxicities are also presented in this entity. CONCLUSION: Despite contemporary treatment approaches which favor the use of chemotherapy (including intrathecal therapy) over radiotherapy in the treatment of CNS leukemia, children still occasionally experience morbid neurotoxicity. Standard neuroimaging is sufficient to identify a variety of neurotoxic sequelae in children, and often suggest specific etiologies. Specific neuroimaging findings frequently indicate a need to alter antileukemia therapy. It is important to appreciate that intrathecal and high doses of systemic chemotherapy are not innocuous and are associated with acute, specific, recognizable, and often serious neurological consequences.","['Laningham, Fred H', 'Kun, Larry E', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Ogg, Robert J', 'Morris, E Brannon', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Laningham FH', 'Kun LE', 'Reddick WE', 'Ogg RJ', 'Morris EB', 'Pui CH']","[""Division of Diagnostic Imaging (MS #210), Department of Radiological Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

In 12 previously described peptides of the Env sequences we found 12 epitopes, while in 4 peptides of the Pol sequences we found 4 epitopes. The total variation on the amino acid composition was 9 and 17% for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II Env epitopes, respectively. After analyzing the Pol sequences, results revealed a total amino acid variation of 0.75% for HLA-I and HLA-II epitopes. In 5 of the 12 Env epitopes the physico-chemical analysis demonstrated that the mutations magnified the antigenicity profile. The potential protein domain analysis of Env sequences showed the loss of a CK-2 phosphorylation site caused by D197N mutation in one epitope, and a N-glycosylation site caused by S246Y and V247I mutations in another epitope. Besides, the analysis of selection pressure have found 8 positive selected sites (w = 9.59) using the codon-based substitution models and maximum-likelihood methods.

In this study we analyzed the results from early discharge, with outpatient care for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective study at the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit of Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo. METHODS: We compared clinical outcomes within 100 days post-transplantation, for 51 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who received partially outpatient-based allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the results were compared with a historical control group of 49 patients who received inpatient-based hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: There were significantly fewer days of hospitalization (p = 0.004), Pseudomonas-positive cultures (p = 0.006) and nausea and vomiting of grade 2-3 (p < 0.001) in the outpatient group. There were no significant differences in mortality between the groups and no deaths occurred within the first 48 days post-transplantation in the outpatient group. CONCLUSIONS: This partially outpatient-based hematopoietic stem cell transplantation program allowed an increased number of transplantations in our institution, in cases of CML and other diseases, since it reduced the median length of hospital stay without increasing morbidity and mortality.","['Nicolau, Jose Eduardo', 'Melo, Leila Maria Magalhaes Pessoa de', 'Sturaro, Daniel', 'Saboya, Rosaura', 'Dulley, Frederico Luiz']","['Nicolau JE', 'Melo LM', 'Sturaro D', 'Saboya R', 'Dulley FL']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. jenicolau@uol.com.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/rehabilitation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Discharge', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/isolation & purification', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vomiting/etiology']",2007/10/10 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-31802007000300009 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802007000300009 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2007 May 3;125(3):174-9. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802007000300009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The familial history of cancer in each child's relatives was reported by the mother in response to a standardized self-administered questionnaire. A familial history of solid tumor in first or second-degree relatives was associated with an increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (odds ratio (OR)=1.6 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1]), while a familial history of hematopoietic malignancies in first or second-degree relatives was associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (OR=4.3 [1.4-13]).

Previous reports found various degrees of methylation at H3K4, H3K9, and H4K20 within the transcribed region of active mammalian genes. To identify the enzymes responsible for placing these modifications, we examined ASH1L, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Trithorax group (TrxG) protein Ash1. Drosophila Ash1 has been reported to methylate H3K4, H3K9, and H4K20 at its target sites. Here we demonstrate that mammalian ASH1L associates with the transcribed region of all active genes examined, including Hox genes. The distribution of ASH1L in transcribed chromatin strongly resembles that of methylated H3K4 but not that of H3K9 or H4K20. Accordingly, the SET domain of ASH1L methylates H3K4 in vitro, and knockdown of ASH1L expression reduced H3K4 trimethylation at HoxA10 in vivo. Notably, prior methylation at H3K9 reduced ASH1L-mediated methylation at H3K4, suggesting cross-regulation among these marks. Drosophila ash1 and trithorax interact genetically, and the mammalian TrxG protein MLL1 and ASH1L display highly similar distributions and substrate specificities. However, by using MLL null cell lines we found that their recruitments occur independently of each other. Collectively, our data suggest that ASH1L occupies most, if not all, active genes and methylates histone H3 in a nonredundant fashion at a subset of genes.","['Gregory, Gregory D', 'Vakoc, Christopher R', 'Rozovskaia, Tanya', 'Zheng, Xingwu', 'Patel, Shetal', 'Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Canaani, Eli', 'Blobel, Gerd A']","['Gregory GD', 'Vakoc CR', 'Rozovskaia T', 'Zheng X', 'Patel S', 'Nakamura T', 'Canaani E', 'Blobel GA']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Division of Hematology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071008,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (ASH1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ash1l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Essential', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mammals/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2007/10/10 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2007/10/10 09:00'],"['2007/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00993-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00993-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Dec;27(24):8466-79. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00993-07.

This study is to investigate whether women employed in an electronics factory increases childhood cancer among first live born singletons. We linked the databases of Birth Registration and Labor Insurance, and National Cancer Registry, which identified 40,647 female workers ever employed in this factory who gave 40,647 first live born singletons, and 47 of them developed cancers during 1979-2001. Mothers employed in this factory during their periconceptional periods (3 months before and after conception) were considered as exposed and compared with those not employed during the same periods. Poisson regression model was constructed to adjust for potential confounding by maternal age, education, sex, and year of birth. Based on 11 exposed cases, the rate ratio of all malignant neoplasms was increased to 2.26 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-4.54] among children whose mothers worked in this factory during periconceptional periods. The RRs were associated with 6 years or less (RR=3.05; 95% CI, 1.20-7.74) and 7-9 years (RR=2.49; 95% CI, 1.26-4.94) of education compared with 10 years or more. An increased association was also found between childhood leukemia and exposed pregnancies (RR=3.83; 95% CI, 1.17-12.55).

Pgp is a poor prognostic factor in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition to its role in drug efflux, pgp has been implicated in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. We investigated the effects of exogenous cholesterol removal on pgp expression and function. METHODS: KG1a drug-naive, primitive leukemia cells were cultured in serum-free medium with or without the addition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. After 72 hours, pgp expression and function was assessed by flow cytometry and total cholesterol content of the KG1a cells was determined by the Amplex Red cholesterol assay. The addition of clinically available cholesterol-lowering agents, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors to KG1a cells was also assessed. RESULTS: There was a 39% (SEM = 8.3%; p = 0.03) decrease in pgp protein expression after 3 days of serum-free culture. The decrease was also observed at the message and functional levels. In the presence of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, pgp expression was restored to 86% of the basal value. Addition of a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to KG1a cells resulted in an additional 26% (lovastatin, p = 0.03) and 16% (pravastatin, p = 0.05) reduction in pgp, respectively. Furthermore, toxicity of the pgp substrate drug daunorubicin was enhanced following lovastatin preculture (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: LDL cholesterol contributes to pgp expression and chemoresistance in primitive leukemia cells.

Proviral DNAs are potently silenced at the level of transcription in these cells. This silencing is largely due to an unidentified trans-acting factor that is thought to bind to the primer binding site (PBS) of M-MLV and repress transcription from the viral promoter. We have partially purified a large PBS-mediated silencing complex and identified TRIM28 (Kap-1), a known transcriptional silencer, as an integral component of the complex. We show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of TRIM28 in EC and ES cells relieves the restriction and that TRIM28 is bound to the PBS in vivo when restriction takes place. The identification of TRIM28 as a retroviral silencer adds to the growing body of evidence that many TRIM family proteins are involved in retroviral restriction.","['Wolf, Daniel', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Wolf D', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim28 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2007/10/10 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/10/10 09:00'],"['2007/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0092-8674(07)00963-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2007 Oct 5;131(1):46-57. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.026.,,,,,['R37 CA30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Cell. 2007 Oct 5;131(1):13-4.

Despite compelling evidence for ionising radiation as a cause of most forms of leukaemia, CLL was not found to be radiogenic in early studies. Herein we describe the recent evidence for causation of CLL by ionising and non-ionising radiation, including a nested case-control study conducted within a cohort of 94 517 US workers at four nuclear weapons facilities and a nuclear naval shipyard. Forty-three cases of CLL deaths and 172 age-matched controls were identified with follow-up up to between 1990 and 1996. Radiation exposure from external sources and plutonium (lagged 10 years) was assessed for each worker, based on monitoring records. The excess relative rate (ERR) was estimated for workers receiving elevated doses compared to unexposed workers, controlling for possible risk factors. The ERR per 10 mSv was -0.020 (95% confidence interval: <0, 0.14) based on all exposed workers. However, for workers receiving <100 mSv, the ERR per 10 mSv was 0.20 (-0.035, 0.96). Recent studies of uranium miners and other populations have shown elevations of CLL possibly associated with ionising and non-ionising radiation. New studies should use incident cases and sufficient latency to account for the expected lengthy induction period for CLL.","['Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K', 'Daniels, Robert D', 'Fleming, Donald A', 'Markey, Andrea M', 'Couch, James R', 'Ahrenholz, Steven H', 'Burphy, Jenneh S', 'Anderson, Jeri L', 'Tseng, Chih-Yu']","['Schubauer-Berigan MK', 'Daniels RD', 'Fleming DA', 'Markey AM', 'Couch JR', 'Ahrenholz SH', 'Burphy JS', 'Anderson JL', 'Tseng CY']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, Cincinnati, OH, USA. zcg3@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20071006,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/analysis', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry/methods', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/10/10 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2007/10/10 09:00'],"['2007/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6843 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06843.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Dec;139(5):799-808. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06843.x.

Clinical trials have been initiated with various preparations of TRAIL as well as agonistic monoclonal antibodies to TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. Previously we reported that prior treatment of primary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors was required to sensitize CLL cells to TRAIL and, using various receptor-selective TRAIL mutant ligands, we demonstrated that CLL cells signalled to apoptosis primarily through TRAIL-R1. Some, but not all, agonistic TRAIL-receptor antibodies require cross-linking in order to induce apoptosis. The present study demonstrated that CLL cells can signal to apoptosis through the TRAIL-R2 receptor, but only after cross-linking of the agonistic TRAIL-R2 antibodies, LBY135 and lexatumumab (HGS-ETR2). In contrast, signalling through TRAIL-R1 by receptor-selective ligands or certain agonistic antibodies, such as mapatumumab (HGS-ETR1), occurs in the absence of cross-linking. These results further highlight important differences in apoptotic signalling triggered through TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 in primary tumour cells. Such information is clearly important for the rational optimisation of TRAIL therapy in primary lymphoid malignancies, such as CLL.","['Natoni, Alessandro', 'MacFarlane, Marion', 'Inoue, Satoshi', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Majid, Aneela', 'Knee, Deborah', 'Stover, David R', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Natoni A', 'MacFarlane M', 'Inoue S', 'Walewska R', 'Majid A', 'Knee D', 'Stover DR', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071008,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Ephrins)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (LBY135 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', '967Q0SJD77 (lexatumumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ephrins/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Panobinostat', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*agonists', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology']",2007/10/10 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2007/10/10 09:00'],"['2007/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6852 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06852.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Nov;139(4):568-77. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06852.x.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had previously untreated measurable disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and creatinine clearance of >50 mL/min. The treatment regimen consisted of cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) on day 1, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and 8, administered at a fixed dose rate of 10 mg/m(2)/min, given every 3 weeks concurrent with gefitinib 500 mg/day orally for a maximum of six cycles. Maintenance gefitinib 500 mg/day was continued for responding or stable disease. RESULTS: In all, 27 patients were accrued before the study was halted because the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) exceeded pre-established stopping rules. The DLT events were two grade 5 (one infection, one cardiovascular accident) and three with grade 4 non-haematological toxicity. In 25 evaluable patients there were nine objective responses, for an overall response rate of 36% (95% confidence interval, CI, 18-57%). The median (95% CI) survival time was 11.1 (5.2-35.3) months. CONCLUSION: The combination of cisplatin, fixed dose-rate gemcitabine and gefitinib is active in advanced TCC, although the relative contribution of gefitinib cannot be determined. However, this regimen was associated with excessive toxicity.","['Philips, George K', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Sanford, Ben L', 'Bajorin, Dean', 'Small, Eric J']","['Philips GK', 'Halabi S', 'Sanford BL', 'Bajorin D', 'Small EJ']","['Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT, USA. george.philips@vtmednet.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071008,England,BJU Int,BJU international,100886721,"['0 (Quinazolines)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*drug therapy', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Urothelium/pathology']",2007/10/10 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/10/10 09:00'],"['2007/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJU7226 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07226.x [doi]']",ppublish,BJU Int. 2008 Jan;101(1):20-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07226.x.

METHODS: We investigated the Stat3-regulated genes in 293 cells with cDNA microarray analysis and found that Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was induced on stimulation of the cells with leukemia inhibitory factor. We examined the expression of NNMT in several types of cancer cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. To examine the role of Stat3, Hep-G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were transfected with NNMT promoter-luciferase reporter construct together with conditionally active Stat3 (Stat3ER) or dominant-negative Stat3 expression vector and NNMT promoter activity was determined. The expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 in 88 colon cancer tissues and 17 normal colon tissues was examined with immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: In Hep-G2 cells and SW480 colon cancer cells, NNMT expression increased on stimulation of the cells with interleukin 6. NNMT promoter activity in Hep-G2 cells was dependent on the activation of Stat3. MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and HT29 colon cancer cells expressed constitutively a high level of NNMT. Treatment of these cells with Stat3 siRNA or curcumin, which inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, resulted in reduction of the NNMT level. We found a correlation between the expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 (P<0.001) in the colon cancer tissues. CONCLUSION: NNMT is a novel Stat3-regulated gene. Its expression is enhanced with the activation of Stat3 in colon cancer tissues. NNMT may be a potential candidate for a tumor marker of various kinds of cancers.","['Tomida, Mikio', 'Ohtake, Hideki', 'Yokota, Takashi', 'Kobayashi, Yasuhito', 'Kurosumi, Masafumi']","['Tomida M', 'Ohtake H', 'Yokota T', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Kurosumi M']","['Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, 818 Komuro, Ina, Saitama 362-0806, Japan. tomida@cancer-c.pref.saitama.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071006,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.1 (Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase/*biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-007-0318-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2008 May;134(5):551-9. doi: 10.1007/s00432-007-0318-6.

Erufosine (ErPC3), the first compound of this class that can be administered intravenously, has recently been shown to be active against human tumor and leukemic cell lines. METHODS: In order to evaluate the antileukemic potential of ErPC3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the lethal concentration 50% (LC 50) was determined using WST-1 assay. For analysis of cell death, staining for Annexin V and activated caspase 3 was performed. An interaction analysis was performed by calculation of combination index and construction of isobolograms. RESULTS: The LC 50 was 7.4 microg/ml after 24 h and 3.2 microg/ml after 72 h in HL 60 cells and 30.1 and 8.6 microg/ml, respectively, in 19 fresh samples from patients with AML. ErPC3 was found to be cytotoxic in HL60 cells with distinct activation of caspase 3. ErPC3 was not cross-resistant with cytarabine, idarubicine and etoposide as shown by the linear relation of respective LC 50s. The latter agents, however, exerted an additive cytotoxicity in combination with ErPC3 as revealed by isobologram analysis and combination index, although results are uneven for idarubicine. CONCLUSION: Based on these data ErPC3 appears as a novel antileukemic candidate drug, which needs to be explored further in the treatment of AML.","['Fiegl, Michael', 'Lindner, Lars H', 'Juergens, Matthias', 'Eibl, Hansjoerg', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Braess, Jan']","['Fiegl M', 'Lindner LH', 'Juergens M', 'Eibl H', 'Hiddemann W', 'Braess J']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071006,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (erucylphospho-N,N,N-trimethylpropylammonium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organophosphates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-007-0612-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Jul;62(2):321-9. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0612-7.

We assessed kidney function by serum creatinine, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity indices (NAGi) and microalbuminuria (MA) in 160 serum and urine samples obtained from 66 children with cancer. The effect of dexrazoxane was analyzed in 6 children on dexrazoxane supportive therapy in conjunction with daunorubicin (DNR) treatment, as compared with 6 children not receiving this agent. NAGi was significantly (p<0.05) elevated after treatment by DNR, doxorubicin, epirubicin (EPI) and idarubicin (IDA). MA proved to be a less sensitive indicator of kidney damage than NAGi. DNR resulted in a progressive deterioration of proximal tubular function as determined by linear regression analysis. The mean NAGi in the dexrazoxanetreated group was significantly (p<0.005) lower than in children not receiving dexrazoxane prior to DNR treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that DNR, EPI and IDA induced an acute renal tubular damage similar to known tubulotoxic agents as cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.

Bcr contains a centrally located Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) domain that is retained within p210 Bcr-Abl. Although this domain is subject to autoinhibition in the context of Bcr, here we show that it is constitutively activated in p210 Bcr-Abl. p210 Bcr-Abl can stimulate RhoA activation independently of its tyrosine kinase activity, and mutations within the RhoGEF domain that are predicted to eliminate RhoGEF activity inhibit RhoA activation. The RhoGEF mutant of p210 Bcr-Abl does not affect the tyrosine kinase activity of the molecule, nor the ability of p210 Bcr-Abl to interact with XPB through the RhoGEF domain. Despite retaining normal levels of tyrosine kinase activity, the RhoGEF mutant of p210 Bcr-Abl is impaired in transforming activity as measured by anchorage-independent growth. However, the mutant is still able to confer the phenotype of growth factor independence in myeloid cells, suggesting that some, but not all parameters of p210 Bcr-Abl transformation, are dependent upon a catalytically active RhoGEF domain.

The 4-year-old girl is the first child of young nonconsanguineous parents of Serbian origin. Gait problems appearing in the second year of life were treated by physiotherapy. At the age of 4 she was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and treated according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster strategy. Owing to typhlitis developing after 15 days of cytotoxic treatment, frequent radiologic examinations were performed causing profound aplasia. Typhlitis did not respond to conservative treatment but necessitated extensive bowel resection. At that time the A-T was suspected by our team and confirmed by increased chromosomal radiosensitivity and markedly reduced level of A-T mutated protein. Chemotherapy was continued without alkylating agents and further radiologic imaging ran an uncomplicated course. At present, the patient is in first remission and 2.5 years since the beginning of the treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 121 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on HDMTX therapy were enrolled into this study. Patients were divided into groups on the basis of either dosage (3 g/m vs. 5 g/m) or infusion duration (7 h vs. 24 h). CF/MTX index was used to determine the calcium folinate (CF) rescuing intensity and toxicity was evaluated according to World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: The overall morbidity of elimination delay was 12.1% in a total of 497 infusions. Patients with elimination delay had lower platelet count (P<0.01) and greater cumulative CF rescuing intensity (P<0.001). In 3-g group, children with elimination delay experienced severer oral mucous membrane damage (P<0.05) than those without elimination delay, and postponement of following chemotherapy (P=0.001). No significant difference was found in morbidity of elimination delay between 3 and 5-g groups (P>0.05) or 7 and 24-hour infusion groups (P>0.05). The only raised adverse effect in 5-g group was gastrointestinal (P=0.003) as compared with 3-g group. The CF rescuing intensity of 5-g group without elimination delay was lower than that of the 3-g group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: (1) HDMTX with 5 g/m is as safe as 3 g/m under adequate hydration and alkalization. Twenty-four-hour infusion is optimal. (2) Individualized dosing is necessary.","['Xu, Weiqun', 'Tang, Yongmin', 'Song, Hua', 'Shi, Shuwen', 'Yang, Shilong']","['Xu W', 'Tang Y', 'Song H', 'Shi S', 'Yang S']","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/10/09 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31814d6777 [doi]', '00043426-200710000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2007 Oct;29(10):688-93. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31814d6777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen patients with acute GvHD (aGvHD) and 10 patients with chronic GvHD (cGvHD) were enrolled in the study. At the start of the ECP protocol, aGvHD was staged as II (n=7), III (n=4), and IV (n=4). The response rate was 100% for aGvHD II, 75% for aGvHD III, and finally 0% for aGvHD IV (P=0.02). In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictor for ECP response was the aGvHD severity: aGvHD II 100%, aGvHD III-IV 30% [relative risk (RR) 5.071, confidence interval (CI) 95% 2.2-5.5, P=0.0016], this translates in a higher risk of transplant-related mortality for ECP nonresponders (RR 5.26, CI 95% 3.4-6.2, P=0.02). cGvHD was diagnosed as limited n=3, and extensive n=7; the response rate was 100% and 28% for limited or extensive cGvHD, respectively (P=0.03). For cGvHD the strongest predictor for ECP response was the absence of visceral organ involvement (RR 5.17, CI 95% 2-4.9, P=0.001), and the highest risk of transplant-related mortality was among patients not responding to ECP (RR 12.4, CI 95%, P=0.02).

C-1748, a DNA intercalating agent has been derived from its precursor C-857 that was a potent anti-cancer drug, but failed clinical development due to ""high"" systemic toxicities. Chemical modifications such as the introduction of a ""methyl"" group imparted novel properties, the most interesting of which is the difference in the IC(50) values between LnCaP (22.5 nM), a CaP cell line and HL-60, a leukemia cell line (>100 nM). Using gammaH2AX as an intervention marker of DNA double strand breaks, we concluded that C-1748 is more efficacious in CaP cells than in HL-60 cells. In hormone dependent cells, the androgen receptor (AR) was identified as an additional target of C-1748. In xenograft studies, administration of C-1748 intra-peritoneally inhibited tumor growth by 80-90% with minimal toxicity. These studies identify C-1748 as a novel acridine drug that has a high therapeutic index and low cytotoxicity on myelocytic cells with potential for clinical development.","['Tadi, Kiranmayi', 'Ashok, Badithe T', 'Chen, Yuangen', 'Banerjee, Debabrata', 'Wysocka-Skrzela, Barbara', 'Konopa, Jerzy', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew', 'Tiwari, Raj K']","['Tadi K', 'Ashok BT', 'Chen Y', 'Banerjee D', 'Wysocka-Skrzela B', 'Konopa J', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Tiwari RK']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070724,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"[""0 (9-(2'-hydroxyethylamino)-4-methyl-1-nitroacridine)"", '0 (Androgen Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '712MLZ30SB (Nitracrine)']",IM,"['Androgen Receptor Antagonists', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nitracrine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['4790 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.6.10.4790 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2007 Oct;6(10):1632-7. doi: 10.4161/cbt.6.10.4790.

METHODS: From July 2001 to September 2006, patients with malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders having human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors were selected for transplant. Pre-transplant infection surveillance was carried out, and strict prophylaxis against infection was observed. After admission to the hospital, patients were kept in protective isolation rooms, equipped with a HEPA filter positive-pressure laminar airflow ventilation system. Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood stem cells were used as the stem cell source. Cyclosporin and prednisolone were used as prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The engraftment was monitored with cytogenetic/molecular analysis and change of blood group. Survival was calculated from the date of transplant to death or last follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-four patients received allogeneic stem cell transplants from HLA-matched siblings for various hematological disorders at the Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, Rawalpindi, Pakistan between July 2001 and September 2006. Indications for transplant included aplastic anemia (n=66), beta-thalassemia major (n=40), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=33), acute leukemia (n=8), and miscellaneous disorders (n=7). One hundred and twenty patients were male and 34 were female. The median age of the patient cohort was 14 years (range 1 1/4-54 years). One hundred and thirty-six patients and 135 donors were cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG-positive. One hundred and forty patients (90.9%) developed febrile episodes in different phases of post-transplant recovery. Infective organisms were isolated in 150 microbiological culture specimens out of 651 specimens from different sites of infections (23.0% culture positivity). Post-transplant infections were confirmed in 120 patients (77.9%) on the basis of clinical assessment and microbiological, virological, and histopathological examination. Mortality related to infections was 13.0%. Fatal infections included CMV disease (100% mortality, 6/6), disseminated aspergillosis (66.7% mortality, 4/6), pseudomonas septicemia (42.9% mortality, 9/21), and tuberculosis (25% mortality, 1/4).

Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity reduces cell growth and induces apoptosis of HTLV-I-transformed T cells, suggesting a central role of NF-kappaB in their proliferation and survival. In this study, we investigated whether MyD88, an adaptor protein of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, contributes to constitutive NF-kappaB activation in HTLV-I-transformed T cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Activation status of MyD88 and interleukin (IL)-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) in HTLV-I-transformed human T cells, MT2, MT4, and HUT102 was examined by using Western blot and immunoprecipitation. TLR expression was evaluated with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. An expression vector encoding a dominant negative MyD88 with a deletion of its death domain (MyD88dn) was transfected into MT2 cells to evaluate roles of MyD88 in spontaneous activation of cytokine gene promoters and transcription factors, proliferation, and apoptosis in HTLV-I-transformed T cells. RESULTS: Constitutive association of MyD88 with IRAK1 was observed in all three of HTLV-I-transformed T cells, but not in HTLV-I-negative T cells, such as Jurkat, HUT78, and MOLT4. MT2 cells showed expression of TLR-1, -6, and -10 mRNAs. Constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and NF-IL-6 and cytokine gene promoters, such as IL-1alpha, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in MT2 cells was inhibited by MyD88dn expression. MyD88dn reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis of MT2 cells. HTLV-I Tax enhanced TLR expression and synergistically activated NF-kappaB with wild-type MyD88. CONCLUSION: Our results show a novel pathway in NF-kappaB activation in HTLV-I-transformed T cells and further demonstrate a critical role of MyD88 in their dysregulated gene activation, survival, and proliferation.","['Mizobe, Takamitsu', 'Tsukada, Junichi', 'Higashi, Takehiro', 'Mouri, Fumihiko', 'Matsuura, Ai', 'Tanikawa, Rena', 'Minami, Yasuhiro', 'Yoshida, Yasuhiro', 'Tanaka, Yoshiya']","['Mizobe T', 'Tsukada J', 'Higashi T', 'Mouri F', 'Matsuura A', 'Tanikawa R', 'Minami Y', 'Yoshida Y', 'Tanaka Y']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071017,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Primers', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2006/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00496-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Dec;35(12):1812-22. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.008.

However, availability of vectors sufficiently and specifically transducing this cell type is very limited. METHOD: Here we report the selection of capsid-modified adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors targeting Kasumi-1 AML cells by screening random AAV displayed peptide libraries. RESULTS: The peptide inserts of the enriched capsid mutants share a common sequence motif. The same motif was selected in an independent library screening on HL-60 AML cells. Recombinant targeted vectors displaying the selected peptides transduced the target leukemia cells they have been selected on up to 500-fold more efficiently compared to AAV vectors with control peptide inserts. One of the selected clones (NQVGSWS) also efficiently transduced all members of a panel of four other AML cell lines. Binding and blocking experiments showed that NQVGSWS binding to leukemia cells is independent of the wild-type AAV-2 receptor heparin sulfate proteoglycan. Transduction assays on a panel of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines showed that the NQVGSWS capsid was able to overcome resistance to AAV transduction, especially in hematopoietic cancer cells, whereas normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells were not transduced. CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, recombinant targeted NQVGSWS AAV vectors harboring a suicide gene conferred selective killing to Kasumi-1 cells, but not to control cells. This suggests that the AAV mutant selected here may be used as a tool to target therapeutic genes to AML cells.","['Michelfelder, Stefan', 'Lee, Mi-Kyung', 'deLima-Hahn, Elisethe', 'Wilmes, Thomas', 'Kaul, Felix', 'Muller, Oliver', 'Kleinschmidt, Jurgen A', 'Trepel, Martin']","['Michelfelder S', 'Lee MK', 'deLima-Hahn E', 'Wilmes T', 'Kaul F', 'Muller O', 'Kleinschmidt JA', 'Trepel M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071017,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Peptide Library)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Peptide Library', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00494-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Dec;35(12):1766-76. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.018.

We investigated whether pharmacological GVHD prophylaxis consisting of four drugs, including a steroid, effectively suppressed GVHD in this transplantation setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who had hematologic malignancies at an advanced stage or with poor prognosis underwent allogeneic BMT using a myeloablative preconditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2), total body irradiation (8-10 Gy), and fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) x 4) with or without cytosine arabinoside (2 g/m(2) x 4), and GVHD prophylaxis consisting of a combination of tacrolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisone (2 mg/kg). Early therapeutic intervention for GVH reaction or grade I GVHD was performed, and steroid was slowly tapered. RESULTS: All patients achieved donor-type engraftment. Neutrophil (>0.5 x 10(9)/L) and platelet (>20 x 10(9)/L) engraftment was achieved on day 13 and on day 30, respectively. Seventeen patients (56.7%) had no GVHD. Eleven patients (36.7%) developed grade II-III acute GVHD. Seven patients (23.3%) died of transplant-related toxicity, including fungal or viral infections and thrombotic microangiopathy, and four patients died of disease progression. Estimated relapse rate at 3 years was only 20.9%. The probability of survival at 3 years was 49.9%. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in unmanipulated HLA-haploidentical allogeneic BMT, this GVHD prophylactic regimen, which includes methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg, and early therapeutic intervention for GVH reaction suppress the incidence of severe GVHD to an acceptable level, while preserving the graft-vs-leukemia effect.","['Ogawa, Hiroyasu', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Kaida, Katsuji', 'Yoshihara, Satoshi', 'Fujioka, Tatsuya', 'Taniguchi, Yuki', 'Tamaki, Hiroya', 'Inoue, Takayuki', 'Hasei, Hitomi', 'Iiboshi, Yasuhiko', 'Tazuke, Yuko', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Kim, Eui Ho', 'Soma, Toshihiro', 'Inoue, Takehiro', 'Kawase, Ichiro']","['Ogawa H', 'Ikegame K', 'Kaida K', 'Yoshihara S', 'Fujioka T', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Tamaki H', 'Inoue T', 'Hasei H', 'Iiboshi Y', 'Tazuke Y', 'Kawakami M', 'Kim EH', 'Soma T', 'Inoue T', 'Kawase I']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita City, Osaka, Japan. ogawah@hyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20071017,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/surgery', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Living Donors', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00521-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Jan;36(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.013.

Leukemic stem cells in AML often exhibit excessive signal-dependent activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Because aberrant interaction between NF-kappaB and coactivators represents an alternative mechanism for enhancing NF-kappaB activity, we evaluated whether MOZ and MOZ-CBP cooperate with NF-kappaB to activate transcription from NF-kappaB-dependent promoters. METHODS: The ability of MOZ, MOZ mutants, and MOZ-CBP to enhance expression of NF-kappaB-dependent promoters was tested in reporter studies. The interaction between MOZ and NF-kappaB was evaluated by both coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. RESULTS: MOZ activates transcription from the NF-kappaB-dependent interleukin-8 promoter; interestingly, this effect is markedly enhanced by CBP. Although MOZ has less potent transcriptional activity than MOZ-CBP, both proteins cooperate with steroid receptor coactivator-1 to activate transcription. MOZ also induces multiple NF-kappaB-dependent viral promoters. Importantly, MOZ associates in a protein complex with the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and interacts directly with p65 in vitro. Transcriptional activity of MOZ requires its C-terminal domain, which is absent from MOZ-CBP, indicating that the transcriptional activity of MOZ-CBP derives from its CBP sequence. CONCLUSIONS: MOZ interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and enhances expression of NF-kappaB-dependent promoters. The more potent transcriptional activity of MOZ-CBP derives from its CBP sequence. Thus, interaction between NF-kappaB and MOZ-CBP may play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain acute myeloid leukemias.","['Chan, Edward M', 'Chan, Rebecca J', 'Comer, Elisha M', 'Goulet, Robert J 3rd', 'Crean, Colin D', 'Brown, Zachary D', 'Fruehwald, Amy M', 'Yang, Zhenyun', 'Boswell, H Scott', 'Nakshatri, Harikrishna', 'Gabig, Theodore G']","['Chan EM', 'Chan RJ', 'Comer EM', 'Goulet RJ 3rd', 'Crean CD', 'Brown ZD', 'Fruehwald AM', 'Yang Z', 'Boswell HS', 'Nakshatri H', 'Gabig TG']","['Walther Oncology Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA. chanem@lilly.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071017,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (MOZ-CBP fusion protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-8/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2006/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00437-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Dec;35(12):1782-92. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.015.

We identified two patients whose lymphocytes showed repeatedly an extensive proportion of TP53 mutated cells by FASAY analysis (the yeast functional assay) and harbored various TP53 mutations, mostly single-base substitutions, in individual cells. The mutation targeting exhibited characteristic traits of the somatic hypermutation process. In the first patient (harboring the unmutated IgVH locus) a significant bias to point mutations at CG pairs (21/25; P=0.009), their remarkable preference for the RGYW/WRCY motives (28%) and the highest expression of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mRNA among the 34 tested B-CLL samples. In the second patient no CG bias was observed but the targeting of point mutations into the RGYW/WRCY motives was even more prominent here (7/16; 44%).

Despite the presence of many imputation methods, these available techniques have some disadvantages. Some imputation techniques constrain the imputation of missing values to a limited set of genes, whereas other imputation methods optimise a more global criterion whereby the computation time of the method becomes infeasible. Others might be fast but inaccurate. Therefore in this paper a new, fast and accurate estimation procedure, called SEQimpute, is proposed. By introducing the idea of minimisation of a statistical distance rather than a Euclidean distance the method is intrinsically different from the thus far existing imputation methods. Moreover, this newly proposed method can be easily embedded in a multiple imputation technique which is better suited to highlight the uncertainties about the missing value estimates. A comparative study is performed to assess the estimation of the missing values by different imputation approaches. The proposed imputation method is shown to outperform some of the existing imputation methods in terms of accuracy and computation speed.","['Verboven, Sabine', 'Branden, Karlien Vanden', 'Goos, Peter']","['Verboven S', 'Branden KV', 'Goos P']","['University of Antwerp, Department of Mathematics, Statistics & Actuarial Sciences, Prinsstraat 13, 2000 Antwerp, Belgium. sabine.verboven@ua.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070710,England,Comput Biol Chem,Computational biology and chemistry,101157394,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/09/23 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1476-9271(07)00085-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2007.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Chem. 2007 Oct;31(5-6):320-7. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2007.07.001.

This pool of ""escaped"" cells is the target of secondary mutations, accumulating over time to induce the aggressive manifestation of acute leukemia. Evidence from patient and animal studies supports the concept that RUNX1 mutations are the initiating event in different leukemia subtypes, but also suggests that diverse mechanisms are used to subvert RUNX1 function. One common result is the inhibition of differentiation-but its effect impinges on different lineages and stages of differentiation, depending on the mutation or fusion partner. A number of different approaches have led to the identification of secondary events that lead to the overt acute phase; however, the majority is unknown.

L1210/VCR is a P-gp-positive drug resistant cell line in which P-gp overexpression was achieved by repeated cultivation of parental cells with a stepwise increasing concentration of vincristine. Relatively little is known about regulation of P-gp expression. Therefore, serious efforts have been made to recognize all aspects involved in regulation of P-gp expression. Retinoic acid nuclear receptors are involved in regulating expression of a large number of different proteins. Several authors have described that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, ligand of retinoic acid receptors, RARs) may induce alterations in P-gp expression and/or activity in drug resistant malignant cell lines. There are also other nuclear receptors for retinoids--retinoid X receptors (RXRs)--that may be involved in the development of the P-gp-mediated MDR phenotype. The topic of the present paper is a study of the relationship, if any, between the regulatory pathways of nuclear receptors for retinoids and P-glycoprotein expression. Increased levels of mRNAs encoding the retinoic acid nuclear receptors RARalpha and gamma, as well as decreased levels of the mRNAs encoding RARbeta and the retinoid X receptor RXRgamma or slightly decreased levels of RXRbeta mRNA, were observed in L1210/VCR cells in comparison with parental L1210 cells. Neither L1210 cells nor L1210/VCR cells contained measurable amounts of mRNA encoding the RXRalpha receptor. ATRA did not influence the viability of L1210/VCR cells differently from L1210 cells. A combined treatment of L1210/VCR cells with vincristine (1.08 micromol/l) and ATRA induced slightly higher cell death than that observed with ATRA alone. When applied alone, ATRA did not influence P-gp expression (monitored by anti P-gp antibody c219 using western blot analysis) or transport activity (monitored by use of calcein/AM as a P-gp substrate by FACS) in L1210/VCR cells. In contrast, when ATRA was applied together with verapamil (an often used P-gp inhibitor), a significant decrease in P-gp expression and transport activity were observed. However, no significant differences in [11, 12-(3)H]-ATRA uptake were observed in either sensitive or resistant cells, in the latter case in the absence or presence of vincristine. Moreover, verapamil did not influence ATRA uptake under any conditions. Thus, we can conclude that the combined treatment of L1210/VCR cells with ATRA and verapamil is able to depress P-gp expression, and consequently its activity. ATRA is not a P-gp-transportable substance, and thus this effect could not be attributed to verapamil-induced inhibition of P-gp that would allow ATRA to reach retinoic acid nuclear receptors and activate them.","['Sulova, Zdena', 'Macejova, Dana', 'Seres, Mario', 'Sedlak, Jan', 'Brtko, Julius', 'Breier, Albert']","['Sulova Z', 'Macejova D', 'Seres M', 'Sedlak J', 'Brtko J', 'Breier A']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Excelence for Cardiovascular Research, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 5, 83334 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070831,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/03/21 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(07)00235-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2007.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2008 Feb;22(1):96-105. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2007.08.011.

In particular, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells have been studied intensively because their phenotype resembles that of normal CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. However, a comprehensive study of FOXP3 expression covering all hematopoietic cell lineages has not yet been performed. In this study, FOXP3 mRNA expression was examined by quantitative PCR using a large collection of human hematopoietic cell lines derived from leukemia/lymphoma or virus-transformation, including cells lines with T, B, plasmacytoid, myeloid, monocytic, megakaryocytic, erythroid, and NK lineages. Unexpectedly, we found FOXP3 mRNA expression in a number of cell lines belonging to all of the cell lineages investigated. In sharp contrast, FOXP3 protein expression was found in only three cell lines, all of which were HTLV-I-infected. Several non-T cell lines expressed higher levels of mRNA but were still negative for protein expression. The broad mRNA expression contrasts with the restricted protein expression of FOXP3 in human hematopoietic cell lines, suggesting that post-transcriptional control mechanisms may control FOXP3 protein expression.","['Yamamoto, Mayuko', 'Tsuji-Takayama, Kazue', 'Suzuki, Motoyuki', 'Harashima, Akira', 'Sugimoto, Akira', 'Motoda, Ryuichi', 'Yamasaki, Fumiyuki', 'Nakamura, Shuji', 'Kibata, Masayoshi']","['Yamamoto M', 'Tsuji-Takayama K', 'Suzuki M', 'Harashima A', 'Sugimoto A', 'Motoda R', 'Yamasaki F', 'Nakamura S', 'Kibata M']","['Cell Biology Institute, Research Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories Inc., 675-1 Fujisaki, Okayama 702-8006, Japan. m_yamamoto@hayashibara.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071024,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00329-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Apr;32(4):651-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.020.

Attempts at autologous transplantation have not shown additional benefit in advanced refractory disease. However, recent reports show that allogeneic transplantation may represent a chance for cure. This benefit must be balanced with the risk of transplant related mortality and graft-versus-host-disease.

Currently, programs to address the stigma approach it as if it occurs in isolation, separate from the co-stigmas related to the various modes of disease transmission including injection drug use (IDU) and commercial sex (CS). In order to develop better programs to address HIV/AIDS related stigma, the inter-relationship (or 'layering') between HIV/AIDS stigma and the co-stigmas needs to be better understood. This paper describes an experimental study for disentangling the layering of HIV/AIDS related stigmas. METHODS: The study used a factorial survey design. 352 medical students from Guangzhou were presented with four random vignettes each describing a hypothetical male. The vignettes were identical except for the presence of a disease diagnosis (AIDS, leukaemia, or no disease) and a co-characteristic (IDU, CS, commercial blood donation (CBD), blood transfusion or no co-characteristic). After reading each vignette, participants completed a measure of social distance that assessed the level of stigmatising attitudes. RESULTS: Bivariate and multivariable analyses revealed statistically significant levels of stigma associated with AIDS, IDU, CS and CBD. The layering of stigma was explored using a recently developed technique. Strong interactions between the stigmas of AIDS and the co-characteristics were also found. AIDS was significantly less stigmatising than IDU or CS. Critically, the stigma of AIDS in combination with either the stigmas of IDU or CS was significantly less than the stigma of IDU alone or CS alone. CONCLUSION: The findings pose several surprising challenges to conventional beliefs about HIV/AIDS related stigma and stigma interventions that have focused exclusively on the disease stigma. Contrary to the belief that having a co-stigma would add to the intensity of stigma attached to people with HIV/AIDS, the findings indicate the presence of an illness might have a moderating effect on the stigma of certain co-characteristics like IDU. The strong interdependence between the stigmas of HIV/AIDS and the co-stigmas of IDU and CS suggest that reducing the co-stigmas should be an integral part of HIV/AIDS stigma intervention within this context.","['Chan, Kit Yee', 'Yang, Yi', 'Zhang, Kong-Lai', 'Reidpath, Daniel D']","['Chan KY', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang KL', 'Reidpath DD']","['School of Health and Social Development, Deakin University, Burwood Highway, Burwood, Victoria 3125, Australia. kchan16@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071005,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Attitude to Health', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Transfusion', 'China/epidemiology', 'Education, Medical, Undergraduate', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', '*HIV Infections/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Judgment', 'Male', 'Prejudice', 'Sex Work', '*Stereotyped Behavior', 'Students, Medical/*psychology', '*Substance Abuse, Intravenous', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2006/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2458-7-280 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-7-280 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2007 Oct 5;7:280. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-7-280.,,,PMC2180176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lymphoblasts were incubated with 0, 10, and 20 U/mL heparin concentrations at 0, 1, and 2 h. The percentages of the apoptotic lymphoblasts were calculated by flow cytometry (FCM), and activities of caspase-3 and -8 were simultaneously measured by fluorometric protease activity method. The apoptotic effect of heparin on the lymphoblasts was determined in 10 and 20 U/mL heparin concentrations (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively) while no apoptosis was detected in 0 U/mL heparin concentration at 0, 1, and 2 h. The apoptotic percentages of the lymphoblasts were higher at the first hour than those at 0 and 2 h in 10 and 20 U/mL heparin levels (p < 0.001). The highest apoptosis was found at first hour in 20 U/mL heparin concentration. Increased concentrations of heparin had an increasing effect on the percentages of the apoptotic lymphoblasts. Significantly higher caspase-3 and -8 activities were determined in 10 and 20 U/mL heparin concentrations than those in 0 U/mL heparin concentration at 0, 1, and 2 h (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the caspase-3 and -8 activities in 10 and 20 U/mL heparin concentrations at 1 and 2 h (p > 0.05), while statistically significant differences were simultaneously detected in the apoptotic rates of the lymphoblasts (p < 0.001). This may be due to that the study included the limited patients, or measurement of the caspase activities is a more sensitive method than the FCM analysis for determination of apoptosis because the activation time of the caspases takes a long time period. It was concluded that the apoptotic effect of heparin in vitro on lymphoblasts developed due to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis via the caspase-3 and -8 activations in newly diagnosed ALL patients.","['Erduran, Erol', 'Deger, Orhan', 'Albayrak, Davut', 'Tekelioglu, Yavuz', 'Ozdemir, Tugba']","['Erduran E', 'Deger O', 'Albayrak D', 'Tekelioglu Y', 'Ozdemir T']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey. erolerduran@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorometry', 'Heparin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*pathology']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2007.0609 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2007 Nov;26(11):803-8. doi: 10.1089/dna.2007.0609.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported the effectiveness of low dose cytarabine (Ara-C) and etoposide (VP-16) (AV therapy) for those elderly AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. We initiated the present feasibility study to improve the efficacy by using glanulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with AV therapy (AVG therapy). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The eligibility for enrolment was AML patients according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria who were over 60 years of age and who had difficulty in tolerating intensive chemotherapy due to their poor performance status (PS) or some comorbidities. They were given continuous drip infusion of Ara-C (20 mg/body) and VP-16 (50 mg/body) for 7-14 days, and were also simultaneously administered G-CSF (150 microg/m2) once daily. RESULTS: The median age of consecutively enrolled 25 patients was 73 years. Eighteen (72%) patients achieved complete remission (CR). The 1-year overall survival (OS) and the 3-year OS rates were 69% and 22%, respectively. The 1-year disease free survival (DFS) rate in CR patients was 44%. The major regimen related toxicities of grade 3 or 4 were only febrile neutropenia in 15 patients (60%). No regimen-related mortality was observed. CONCLUSION: AVG therapy was therefore found to be an effective and well-tolerated regimen for remission induction in elderly AML patients with poor PS or comorbidity.","['Kanemura, Nobuhiro', 'Tsurumi, Hisashi', 'Kasahara, Senji', 'Hara, Takeshi', 'Yamada, Toshiki', 'Sawada, Michio', 'Goto, Naoe', 'Kitagawa, Jun-ichi', 'Shimizu, Masahito', 'Oyama, Masami', 'Moriwaki, Hisataka']","['Kanemura N', 'Tsurumi H', 'Kasahara S', 'Hara T', 'Yamada T', 'Sawada M', 'Goto N', 'Kitagawa J', 'Shimizu M', 'Oyama M', 'Moriwaki H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Gifu University School of Medicine, Gifu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2007/10/09 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/10/09 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.834 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2008 Mar;26(1):33-8. doi: 10.1002/hon.834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, AYAs had the best survival rates due to the prevalence of highly curable diseases including Hodgkin lymphoma and germ cell tumors, yet today AYAs have inferior survival rates to children and some adult cohorts. Survival rates are particularly poor for AYA-specific diseases such as sarcomas. Research involving children and adults diagnosed with common malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia has resulted in improved survival rates. However, AYAs have not directly benefited from such research due to low rates of access to and accrual on clinical trials. AYAs are less likely to have insurance or access to healthcare, are more likely to see providers who are not part of research institutions, and are less likely to be referred to or to join clinical trials, all of which may contribute to worse outcomes. Few clinical trials target AYA-specific diseases, leading to little information regarding how these diseases behave and what role the host plays. Tumor samples for this population are underrepresented in national tumor banks. Coupled with the need for more clinical trials that focus on AYA-specific cancers, better collaboration between adult and pediatric cooperative groups as well as increased education among community oncologists and primary care providers will be needed to enhance participation in clinical trials with the goal to increase survival and improve quality of that survival.","['Burke, Megan E', 'Albritton, Karen', 'Marina, Neyssa']","['Burke ME', 'Albritton K', 'Marina N']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA. burkem2@ccf.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Health Education', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', '*Patient Selection', 'Survival Rate']",2007/10/06 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23060 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Dec 1;110(11):2385-93. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23060.,,49,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that continuous infusion of CsA with a target blood level between 250 and 400 ng/ml significantly increased the incidence of acute GVHD compared to twice-daily infusion with a target trough level between 150 and 300 ng/ml. Thus, we raised the target level of CsA continuous infusion to 450-550 ng/ml. We treated 33 patients with the higher target level (CsA500) and compared the efficacy and toxicity with those in the 33 historical control patients (CsA300 group). Other transplantation procedures were not changed. The patients' characteristics were equivalent. The average CsA concentration was adjusted around 500 ng/ml and the actual daily dose was maintained at the initial dose (CsA 3mg/kg/day). Toxicities were equivalently observed among the two groups. The incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD was significantly lower in the CsA500 group (27 vs. 52%, P = 0.033). The target level of CsA was identified as an independent significant risk factor for grades II-IV acute GVHD (P = 0.039), adjusted for the presence of HLA mismatch.

We therefore compared the observed deaths among workers to expectations based upon death rates for referent populations. METHODS: The cohort included 18,883 SRS workers hired between 1950 and 1986. Vital status and cause of death information were ascertained through 2002. Sex-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were computed using U.S. and South Carolina mortality rates. SMRs were tabulated separately for monthly-, weekly-, and hourly-paid men. RESULTS: Males had fewer deaths from all causes [SMR=0.80, 90% confidence interval (CI): 0.78, 0.82], all cancers (SMR=0.85, 90% CI: 0.81, 0.89), and lung cancer (SMR=0.88, 90% CI: 0.82, 0.95) than expected based upon US mortality rates. The SMR for cancer of the pleura was 4.25 (90% CI: 1.99, 7.97) for men. The SMR for leukemia was greater than unity for monthly-paid (SMR=1.33, 90% CI: 0.88, 1.93) and hourly-paid (SMR=1.36, 90% CI: 1.02, 1.78) men. Female workers had fewer deaths from all causes (SMR=0.75, 90% CI: 0.69, 0.82) than expected, but more deaths than expected from cancer of the kidney (SMR=2.58, 90% CI: 1.21, 4.84) and skin (SMR=3.90, 90% CI: 2.11, 6.61). CONCLUSIONS: While the observed numbers of deaths in most categories of cause of death were less than expected, there are greater than expected numbers of deaths due to cancer of the pleura and leukemia, particularly among hourly-paid male workers. It is plausible that occupational hazards, including asbestos and ionizing radiation, contribute to these excesses.","['Richardson, David B', 'Wing, Steve', 'Wolf, Susanne']","['Richardson DB', 'Wing S', 'Wolf S']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA. david.richardson@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', '*Occupational Health', '*Population Surveillance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Rivers', 'Sex Factors', 'South Carolina/epidemiology', 'United States']",2007/10/06 09:00,2008/02/21 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.20511 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2007 Dec;50(12):881-91. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20511.,,,,,['R01 OH007871/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively reviewed data on paediatric FN episodes in 7 Norwegian hospitals during a 2.5-y period. A total of 236 episodes of FN occurred in 95 children. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was the most common diagnosis (49 patients). Blood cultures yielded growth in 39 episodes (17%). Primary empirical antibiotic regimens could be assigned to 2 main groups: 1) benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside (58%) or 2) a regimen based on third-generation cephalosporins (42%). There were no statistically significant differences in outcome between the 2 regimens in terms of need to change initial antibiotic treatment, d of fever or maximum C-reactive protein values. One infection-related death (fungal septicaemia) occurred during the study period. We conclude that incidence of septicaemia and clinical outcome is similar to recent international trials on paediatric FN, but antibiotic treatment in Norway differs from international guidelines. However, patients in our study were successfully and safely treated, irrespective of the primary empirical antibiotic regimen.","['Stabell, Niklas', 'Nordal, Ellen', 'Stensvold, Einar', 'Gammelsrud, Karianne Wiger', 'Lund, Bendik', 'Taxt, Arne', 'Buhring, Frauke', 'Greve-Isdahl, Margrethe', 'Fornebo, Hans Petter', 'Simonsen, Gunnar Skov', 'Klingenberg, Claus']","['Stabell N', 'Nordal E', 'Stensvold E', 'Gammelsrud KW', 'Lund B', 'Taxt A', 'Buhring F', 'Greve-Isdahl M', 'Fornebo HP', 'Simonsen GS', 'Klingenberg C']","['Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway, N-9038 Tromso, Norway. niklas.stabell@unn.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Fever/chemically induced/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/drug effects', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', '*Neutropenia/chemically induced/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/10/06 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['782850836 [pii]', '10.1080/00365540701670436 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 2008;40(4):301-7. doi: 10.1080/00365540701670436.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Focused recruitment of ethnic minorities for cord blood donation has been proposed as the preferred strategy to improve access for minority recipients to cord blood for transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate cord blood characteristics for Caucasian and African American donors and the success of ethnically mismatched UC blood transplantation in African American recipients. METHODS: Retrospective data analysis was performed comparing the characteristics of 556 cord blood units from African American and Caucasian donors. The outcomes of 18 African American ethnically mismatched transplant recipients were compared with a paired sample of 18 ethnically matched Caucasian recipients. RESULTS: The fraction of collected units meeting acceptability criteria from African Americans was significantly lower compared with Caucasians (P = <0.0001). Additionally, African Americans had a significantly lower post-processing total nucleated cell count (TNC) compared with Caucasians (P=0.007) but there were no other significant differences in conventionally measured product characteristics. In the transplant analysis, there was no difference in overall survival at 1 year (P=0.85) or time to neutrophil engraftment (P=0.92) between the two patient populations. DISCUSSION: At comparable levels of TNC dose and HLA matching, the use of ethnically mismatched UC blood units as a source for allogeneic unrelated transplant can result in successful transplant outcomes for African American patients.","['Wofford, J', 'Kemp, J', 'Regan, D', 'Creer, M']","['Wofford J', 'Kemp J', 'Regan D', 'Creer M']","[""Saint Louis Cord Blood Bank at SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, St Louis, MO 63110, USA. jwofford@slcbb.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,,IM,"['*African Americans', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood Donors', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*ethnology/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*ethnology/methods/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Whites']",2007/10/06 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['782862996 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240701620570 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2007;9(7):660-6. doi: 10.1080/14653240701620570.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the differences in DC-mediated immune responses from different types of malignancies in dogs, we vaccinated dogs using autologous DCs pulsed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and cell lysate prepared from squamous cell carcinoma SCC2/88 (SCC-KLH-DC), histiocytic sarcoma CHS-5 (CHS-KLH-DC), or B cell leukemia GL-1 (GL-KLH-DC) in vitro. In vivo inductions of immune responses against these tumor cells were compared by the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test. The DTH response against SCC2/88 cells were observed in dogs vaccinated with autologous SCC-KLH-DC, while the response was undetectable against CHS-5 and GL-1 cells in dogs vaccinated with autologous CHS-KLH-DC and GL-KLH-DC. Skin biopsies taken from DTH challenge sites were then examined for immunohistochemistry, and recruitment of CD8 and CD4 T cells was detected at the site where SCC2/88 cells were inoculated in dogs vaccinated with SCC-KLH-DC. By contrast, neither CD8 nor CD4 T cell infiltration was found at the DTH challenge site in the dogs vaccinated with CHS-KLH-DC or GL-KLH-DC. These findings may reflect that the efficacy of immune induction by DC vaccination varies among tumor types and that immune responses could be inducible in squamous cell carcinoma.

A recent study has demonstrated, by using antibody to acetylated lysine, and a STAT3 mutant with Lys-685-to-Arg substitution, that STAT3 is acetylated at Lys-685 by histone acetyltransferase p300, and that acetylation at Lys-685 is critical for STAT3 activation. In the present study, we created an acetyl-specific antibody against STAT3 acetylated at Lys-685, and found that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or interleukin (IL)-6 induced acetylation of STAT3 at Lys-685 in 293T and Hep3B cells. Moreover, acetylation of STAT3 at Lys-685 was suppressed by PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or a dominant negative Akt.

Both CD11b and CC chemokine receptor, CCR3 expression were upregulated, while CD71 expression was downregulated by ATRA or ATRA+IL-5. Concomitantly, marked production of eotaxin-2/CCL24 was observed, but no production of eotaxin-1/CCL11 and eotaxin-3/CCL26 was detected. Since only 20 to 30% cells incubated with ATRA became positive for CCR3, CCR3(+) population was enriched by a magnetic activated cell sorter (MACS). Enriched CCR3(+) population produced higher eotaxin-2/CCL24 than the CCR3(-) population, indicating that differentiated eosinophils are capable of producing eotaxin-2/CCL24. During the ATRA-induced differentiation, expression of a transcriptional factor, GATA-1 was significantly increased. Introduction of siRNA against GATA-1 markedly reduced the ATRA-induced differentiation markers including CD11b and CCR3, as well as reduced eotaxin-2/CCL24 production. Finally, ATRA-induced differentiation and eotaxin-2/CCL24 production were greatly enhanced in the GATA-1-overexpressed clones. These results indicate that the ability to produce eotaxin-2/CCL24 is acquired during the differentiation into eosinophilic lineage which is dependent on GATA-1 expression.","['Yoshida, Naomi', 'Aizu-Yokota, Eriko', 'Sonoda, Yoshiko', 'Moriwaki, Yasuhiro', 'Kishi, Kenji', 'Kasahara, Tadashi']","['Yoshida N', 'Aizu-Yokota E', 'Sonoda Y', 'Moriwaki Y', 'Kishi K', 'Kasahara T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kyoritsu University of Pharmacy, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (CCL24 protein, human)', '0 (CCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL24)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, CCR3)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects/physiology', 'Chemokine CCL24', 'Chemokines, CC/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/physiology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, CCR3', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2007/10/06 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/30.1826 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.30.1826 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2007 Oct;30(10):1826-32. doi: 10.1248/bpb.30.1826.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokine and chemokine release is typically measured by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) or Western blot analysis.

Each slide consists of 16 subarrays (wells), each printed with 12 specific antibodies in triplicate and positive and negative control elements. This 16-well format allows for the analysis of 10 test samples using a six-point standard curve. The array architecture is based on the ""sandwich"" ELISA, in which an analyte protein is sandwiched between an immobilized capture antibody and a biotinylated detection antibody, using streptavidin-linked Thermo Scientific DyLight 649 Dye for quantitation. The observed sensitivity of this assay was <10 pg/mL. In our experiments, the Jurkat cell line was used as a model for human T-cell leukemia, and the A549 cell line was used as a model for human non-small cell lung cancer. To evoke a cytokine/chemokine response, cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, TPA), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Cell supernatants derived from both untreated and stimulated cells were analyzed on four different arrays (Inflammation I, Inflammation II, Angiogenesis, and Chemotaxis), enabling the quantitation of 41 unique analytes. Stimulated cells showed an increase in the expression level of many of the test analytes, including IL-8, TNF-alpha, and MIP-1alpha, compared to the non-treated controls.

Patients with indolent versus aggressive malignancies were equally distributed among both cohorts.

HOX protein products are transcription factors whose precise mechanism of action is still poorly understood. Regulation of HOX gene expression has been the topic of various studies. While alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage have been known to increase the number of transcripts across the HOX clusters, more recently high-throughput analyses have identified a number of new coding and noncoding RNA molecules whose function is not known. Here we review the transcriptome of the most studied HOX locus, HOXA9. Strict control of HOXA9 expression has been shown to play a critical role in hematopoiesis while aberrant expression has been shown to be important to the development of leukemia. However, it is still unclear how various transcripts from this locus are regulated and what specific role(s) each one of them plays.","['Popovic, Relja', 'Erfurth, Frank', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy']","['Popovic R', 'Erfurth F', 'Zeleznik-Le N']","['Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071003,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2007/10/06 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00182-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.07.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Mar-Apr;40(2):156-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.07.016.

METHODS: The AmpFlSTR Identifiler amplification kit (Applied Biosystem, CA) was used to perform STR-PCR for the study of engraftment. RESULTS: At 6 months post-transplantation, the peripheral blood genotype shows a mixture of donor and recipient alleles, consistent with disease relapse. Interestingly, the D18S51 locus shows 2 donor alleles and only 1 recipient allele, the other recipient allele is missing. To further confirm chromosome loss, we used the D18S53 and D18S1129 in the ABI PRISM Linkage Mapping Sets. The D18S53 locus showed the recipient allele (179 bp) and shared allele (171 bp). Interestingly, the D18S1129 locus showed almost only 1 recipient allele (243 bp); the other recipient allele and shared allele (251 bp) is missing. CONCLUSION: The case illustrates that chromosome loss in tumor cells during the course of disease may cause corresponding loss of an STR locus. This circumstance is a potential source of error in the interpretation of engraftment analysis, especially if only one informative allele is used to monitor engraftment.","['Chen, Ding-Ping', 'Tsai, Shu-Hui', 'Tseng, Ching-Ping', 'Wu, Tsu-Lan', 'Chang, Pi-Yueh', 'Sun, Chien-Feng']","['Chen DP', 'Tsai SH', 'Tseng CP', 'Wu TL', 'Chang PY', 'Sun CF']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan County, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20070904,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,,IM,"['Adult', '*Alleles', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*surgery', 'Recurrence']",2007/10/06 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-8981(07)00424-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2007.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2008 Jan;387(1-2):161-4. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2007.08.013.

In the clinical setting, there is presently no effective procedure for separating testicular cells from cancer cells. Here, CD4, a selective surface marker for Roser's rat leukaemic T-cells, was utilized to eliminate cancer cells from testicular cell samples from leukaemic piebald variegated (PVG) rats by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). All animals receiving MACS-selected testicular cells died within 14-15 days. Only one-third of the contaminating leukaemic cells could be removed from testicular samples. An increase in antibody concentration enhanced the proportion of leukaemic cells removed from 27 to 49%. Variations in the cell size and expression of surface antigens on testicular leukaemic cells were the major obstacles to purification based on this marker. It is concluded that MACS does not prevent transmission of leukaemia to syngenic PVG rats when cells from leukaemic testes are used for testicular cell transplantation.","['Hou, Mi', 'Andersson, Margareta', 'Zheng, Chengyun', 'Sundblad, Anne', 'Soder, Olle', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi']","['Hou M', 'Andersson M', 'Zheng C', 'Sundblad A', 'Soder O', 'Jahnukainen K']","['Department of Women and Child Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

Myeloid/NK-cell precursor acute leukaemia may also develop from precursor NK cells.

The role of NRP-1 in refractory or relapsed AML patients and its regulation during anti-angiogenic treatment remain to be elucidated. METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies of 10 patients with refractory or relapsed AML were evaluated for NRP-1 expression by immunohistochemical analysis, and NRP-1 expression level was determined before and after start of thalidomide therapy and correlated to response and growth factor expression. RESULTS: NRP-1 expression was significantly increased in AML patients [median 7 arbitrary units (AU)] when compared with controls (n = 38, median 2.75 AU). Under thalidomide treatment, a marked difference in the course of NRP-1 expression between responders and non-responders was observed, however, without a statistical significance (P = 0.071) being reached. Additionally, a significant correlation of the NRP-1 expression level to microvessel density could be detected under treatment with thalidomide (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence of increased NRP-1 expression in relapsed or refractory AML. Additionally, our results suggest that thalidomide-induced antileukemic properties might at least in part be mediated by NRP-1 downregulation.","['Kreuter, Michael', 'Steins, Martin', 'Woelke, Katja', 'Buechner, Thomas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Mesters, Rolf M']","['Kreuter M', 'Steins M', 'Woelke K', 'Buechner T', 'Berdel WE', 'Mesters RM']","['Department of Medicine/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071003,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Angiogenic Proteins/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropilin-1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Thalidomide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2007/10/06 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/10/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH954 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00954.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Nov;79(5):392-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00954.x.

Available toxicological data of ionic liquids have already suggested initial guidelines for the conscious design of safer chemicals. In this study a new group of such redesigned ionic liquids-1-alkoxymethyl-3-hydroxypyridinium cations+acesulphamate, saccharinate and chloride anions-was assayed with respect to their inhibitory activity towards acetylcholinesterase and their cellular toxicity towards the IPC-81 rat promyelocytic leukaemia cell line: the acute biological activity of these compounds is very low. Effective concentrations lie in the millimole range, which is well above possible intracellular concentrations. Only the compounds with the longest alkoxymethyl chain inhibit the enzyme at effective concentrations that are one order of magnitude smaller. No significant differences are observed when the anion compartment in the enzymatic assay is varied. However, the cytotoxicity data show EC(50) for acesulphamates and saccharinates to be higher than the values for the chloride analogues. Also, a slight alkoxymethyl chain length effect on the overall cytotoxicity is discernible. The biodegradability of the 1-alkoxymethyl-3-hydroxypyridinium salts varies from 21% to 72% and depends on the type of anion the cation is linked with. It improves with lengthening alkyl chain, but only in the range from 4 to 11 carbon atoms.","['Stasiewicz, M', 'Mulkiewicz, E', 'Tomczak-Wandzel, R', 'Kumirska, J', 'Siedlecka, E M', 'Golebiowski, M', 'Gajdus, J', 'Czerwicka, M', 'Stepnowski, P']","['Stasiewicz M', 'Mulkiewicz E', 'Tomczak-Wandzel R', 'Kumirska J', 'Siedlecka EM', 'Golebiowski M', 'Gajdus J', 'Czerwicka M', 'Stepnowski P']","['Department of Chemical Technology, Poznan University of Technology, sq.

In Malawi, cyclophosphamide (CPM), the mainstay of treatment for endemic BL, is effective in around 50% of cases. Evidence exists in support of an association between activation of replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the tumour and response to this chemotheraupeutic agent. Phenylbutyrate (PB), approved for treatment of inborn errors of the urea cycle with minimal toxicity in children, induces EBV replication and cell lysis in BL-derived cell cultures. It has also shown some success as adjuvant in treatment of chronic leukaemia and lymphoma. We tested in African BL patients with CPM-resistant tumours, and thus unlikely to survive, the hypothesis that PB can reverse this resistance. A study of five patients showed PB before CPM to induce shrinkage of CPM-resistant tumours in two of them.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if species from ancient wheat could be considered as healthy food crops devoid or poor in cytotoxic prolamines for celiac disease. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was measured in terms of inhibition of cell growth, activation of apoptosis, release of nitric oxide (NO), detection of tissue transglutaminase (TG II) and alteration of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) on Caco-2/Tc7 and K562 (S) cell agglutination. Peptic-tryptic (PT) digest from bread wheat (T. aestivum S. Pastore) was used as a positive control. RESULTS: PT digests of prolamins from spelt wheat (T. aestivum ssp. spelta) were found to exert toxic effects on Caco-2/TC7 cells and to agglutinate K562(S) cells. Increased amounts of NO and TG II expression were observed in Caco-2/TC7 cells exposed to 1 mg/mL of spelt prolamins, suggesting that spelt wheat can induce cellular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. By contrast, the PT digests from monoccum wheat (Triticum monococcum) and farro wheat (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum) did not exhibit any negative effects on Caco-2/TC7 and K562(S) cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown a constant and significant toxic effect of spelt wheat which is not shared by the two other ancient cereals. Future studies on celiac intestinal organ cultures are needed to increase the prospects of breeding programs aimed at developing wheat cultivars potentially tolerated by most celiac patients.","['Vincentini, Olimpia', 'Maialetti, Francesca', 'Gazza, Laura', 'Silano, Marco', 'Dessi, Mariarita', 'De Vincenzi, Massimo', 'Pogna, Norberto Edgardo']","['Vincentini O', 'Maialetti F', 'Gazza L', 'Silano M', 'Dessi M', 'De Vincenzi M', 'Pogna NE']","['Division of Food Science, Human Nutrition and Health, National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,"['0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Prolamins)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Agglutination/drug effects', 'Agglutination Tests', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Caspases/metabolism', '*Celiac Disease/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electric Impedance', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'K562 Cells', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Plant Proteins/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'Prolamins', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Time Factors', 'Transglutaminases/metabolism', '*Triticum/chemistry']",2007/10/05 09:00,2008/01/19 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['JGH4680 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1746.2006.04680.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2007 Nov;22(11):1816-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2006.04680.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: CXCL12 levels in serum were evaluated from ALL-children and controls. The biological effect of recombinant CXCL12 on primary leukaemic cells was investigated. Signalling via the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis was further characterized in an in vitro model using the pre-B leukaemic cell line Nalm-6. RESULTS: The serum level of CXCL12 in children at diagnosis of pre-B-ALL is significantly higher than in healthy children (4.8 (0-32) ng/ml vs. 0 (0-3.2) ng/ml, P < 0.001). After completed chemotherapy, CXCL12 decreases to levels comparable to those found in the control group. In addition, we found that recombinant CXCL12 enhances pre-B leukaemic cell proliferation in vitro. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is able to initiate functional signalling and we show that STAT5 is activated in CD19+ leukaemic cells from BM of ALL patients and in the leukaemic cell line Nalm-6. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CXCL12 may have a role in leukaemic cell proliferation and survival during childhood ALL.","['Mowafi, Frida', 'Cagigi, Alberto', 'Matskova, Ludmila', 'Bjork, Olle', 'Chiodi, Francesca', 'Nilsson, Anna']","['Mowafi F', 'Cagigi A', 'Matskova L', 'Bjork O', 'Chiodi F', 'Nilsson A']","['Microbiology Tumour Biology Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*blood/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",2007/10/05 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21370 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):812-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21370.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURES: Dasatinib was tested against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) in vitro panel at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1.0 microM and was tested in vivo at a dose of 50 mg/kg administered orally twice daily 5 days per week for 4 weeks for the solid tumor xenografts and once daily for the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenografts. RESULTS: Dasatinib was selectively active against the cell lines of the PPTP in vitro panel, reaching an IC(50) in 6 of the 22 lines. The most sensitive were the AML line Kasumi-1, which has a gain-of-function c-Kit mutation (Asn822Lys), and the rhabdoid tumor line CHLA-266 (IC(50) approximately 10 nM for each). In the in vivo panel, dasatinib induced significant differences in EFS distribution in 8 of 32 (25%) solid tumor models and 3 of 7 ALL models. Using the time to event activity measure, dasatinib had intermediate activity against 1 of 27 (4%) evaluable solid tumor xenografts and 3 of 7 ALL xenografts. One xenograft in the ALL panel, a Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) ALL xenograft, demonstrated a complete response. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib was active at low nanomolar concentrations against a small subset of the PPTP's in vitro panel. Dasatinib had limited in vivo activity against the PPTP solid tumor xenografts, but was highly active against a Ph(+) ALL xenograft and also had anti-leukemia activity against two other xenografts.","['Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Tajbakhsh, Mayamin', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Maris, John M', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Lock RB', 'Tajbakhsh M', 'Reynolds CP', 'Maris JM', 'Keir ST', 'Billups CA', 'Smith MA']","[""The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York, USA. eakolb@nemours.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/10/05 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21368 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jun;50(6):1198-206. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21368.,,,,,"['CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated the effects of dendritic cells infected with adenoviral DeltaNp73alpha (DNp73alpha) on breaking immune tolerance and induction of immunity against DNp73alpha-expressing (A549 lung cancer, K-562 leukemia) and non-expressing (MCF-7 breast cancer) cell lines. Immature dendritic cells generated in the presence of interleukin-4 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor from a human umbilical cord blood were transduced with a recombinant adenoviral (Ad) vector encoding full-length human DNp73alpha cDNA (Ad-DNp73alpha) or a control vector Ad-EGFP, using the centrifugal force method. Induction of DNp73alpha-specific CTL response was evaluated by a cytotoxic assay against the three human tumor cell lines with different DNp73alpha expression levels. The viability and activation status of transduced dendritic cells were assessed by flow cytometry. The dendrocyte/Ad-DNp73alpha-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes showed significantly higher cytotoxicity against the cell lines A549/DNp73alpha, K-562 that expressed DNp73alpha than the DNp73alpha-null MCF-7 cells. The DCs/Ad-DNp73alpha showed higher survival rates than the DCs/Ad-EGFP or untransduced DCs, presumably due to the inhibition of cell death. These findings, with potential applications for immunotherapy, demonstrate that dendrocytes transduced with Ad-DNp73alpha can induce specific and sustained T cell responses against tumors expressing this variant p53-related gene.","['Hu, Yijie', 'He, Yong', 'Srivenugopal, Kalkunte S', 'Fan, Shizhi', 'Jiang, Yaoguang']","['Hu Y', 'He Y', 'Srivenugopal KS', 'Fan S', 'Jiang Y']","[""Thoracic Surgery Center of People's Liberation Army, Daping Hospital, the Third Military Medical University, Changjiang Street 10, Daping, Chongqing 400042, P.R.

From the National Patient Registry covering all Danish hospitals, we obtained data on hospitalizations with chronic diseases, recorded before the date of NMSC diagnosis. Using incidence density sampling, we selected 10 age-, gender-, and residence-matched controls from the Danish Civil Registration System. We used conditional logistic regression to compute incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Although no overall association was found between basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and hospitalization for chronic diseases, an elevated IRR for BCC was found among patients with connective tissue disease (IRR 1.34 (95% CI: 0.99-1.82)), transplants (IRR 8.00 (95% CI: 2.15-30)), and lymphoma (IRR 2.50 (95% CI: 1.29-4.84)).

We genotyped six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within or close to the IL5RA or IL5 genes in 82 patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL plus, as controls, healthy individuals (n=100), patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative eosinophilia (n=100) or patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) (n=100). We found no association between SNP allele frequency between FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive and control cases. However, for FIP1L1-PDGFRA cases, we found an association between the genotype at rs4054760, an SNP in the 5'-UTR of IL5RA and peripheral blood eosinophil count (P=0.026) as well as the presence or absence of tissue infiltration (P=0.032). Although these associations fell below the level of significance once corrected for multiple testing, no such association was seen in FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative cases and no difference in allele frequencies for rs4054760 was seen in control populations across Europe. Furthermore, in an analysis of 112 patients with CML, IL5RA expression was strongly related to rs4054760 genotype (P<0.001). These data suggest that the variations in IL5RA expression are linked to constitutional IL5RA genotype and severity of FIP1L1-PDGFRA disease.","['Burgstaller, S', 'Kreil, S', 'Waghorn, K', 'Metzgeroth, G', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Zoi, K', 'White, H', 'Cilloni, D', 'Zoi, C', 'Brito-Babapulle, F', 'Walz, C', 'Reiter, A', 'Cross, N C P']","['Burgstaller S', 'Kreil S', 'Waghorn K', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Preudhomme C', 'Zoi K', 'White H', 'Cilloni D', 'Zoi C', 'Brito-Babapulle F', 'Walz C', 'Reiter A', 'Cross NC']","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, University of Southampton, Salisbury, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071004,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (IL5 protein, human)', '0 (IL5RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-5 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Chronic Disease', 'Eosinophils', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/blood/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Interleukin-5/genetics', 'Interleukin-5 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*analysis/genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*analysis/genetics']",2007/10/05 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404977 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404977 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2428-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404977.

Recently, the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) has been successfully used clinically, although, disease relapse can still occur. The precise detail of the mechanism by which CML cells respond to imatinib is still unclear. We therefore systematically examined the effects of imatinib on the primitive CML cell proteome, having first established that the drug inhibits proliferation and induces increased apoptosis and differentiation. To define imatinib-induced effects on the CML proteome, we employed isobaric tag peptide labeling (iTRAQ) coupled to two-dimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Given the limited clinical material available, the isobaric tag approach identified a large population of proteins and provided relative quantification on four samples at once. Novel consequences of the action of imatinib were identified using this mass spectrometric approach. DEAD-box protein 3, heat shock protein 105 kDa, and peroxiredoxin-3 were identified as potential protein markers for response to imatinib.","['Griffiths, Stephen D', 'Burthem, John', 'Unwin, Richard D', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Lucas, Guy S', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Griffiths SD', 'Burthem J', 'Unwin RD', 'Holyoake TL', 'Melo JV', 'Lucas GS', 'Whetton AD']","['Division of Cancer Studies, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Christie Hospital, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 9BX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Biotechnol,Molecular biotechnology,9423533,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HSP110 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPH1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxin III)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX3X protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/analysis', 'HSP110 Heat-Shock Proteins/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Peroxidases/analysis', 'Peroxiredoxin III', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteome/analysis/*drug effects', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/10/05 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 00:00 [received]', '1999/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['MB:36:2:81 [pii]', '10.1007/s12033-007-0005-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biotechnol. 2007 Jun;36(2):81-9. doi: 10.1007/s12033-007-0005-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A strong enhancement of susceptibility to the shock was observed in mice acutely infected with this virus. It correlated with a sharp increase of tumor necrosis factor and leukemia inhibitory factor production and was controlled by the mouse genetic background. The viral infection led to an imbalance in the cytokine response to LPS, with an enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-18 and IFN-gamma and a delayed secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 that could result in exacerbated macrophage activation. Enhanced IFN-gamma production was involved in the virus-induced susceptibility to shock.

Here, we demonstrate that the LRP16 expression is estrogen dependent in several epithelium-derived tumor cells. In addition, the suppression of the endogenous LRP16 in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive MCF-7 cells not only inhibits cells growth, but also significantly attenuates the cell line's estrogen-responsive proliferation ability. However, ectopic expression of LRP16 in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 cells has no effect on proliferation. These data suggest the involvement of LRP16 in estrogen signaling. We also provide novel evidence by both ectopic expression and small interfering RNA knockdown approaches that LRP16 enhances ERalpha-mediated transcription activity. In stably LRP16-inhibitory MCF-7 cells, the estrogen-induced upregulation of several well-known ERalpha target genes including cyclin D1 and c-myc is obviously impaired. Results from glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that LRP16 physically interacts with ERalpha in a manner that is estrogen independent but is enhanced by estrogen. Furthermore, a mammalian two-hybrid assay indicated that the binding region of LRP16 localizes to the A/B activation function 1 domain of ERalpha. Taken together, these results present new data supporting a role for estrogenically regulated LRP16 as an ERalpha coactivator, providing a positive feedback regulatory loop for ERalpha signal transduction.","['Han, W-D', 'Zhao, Y-L', 'Meng, Y-G', 'Zang, L', 'Wu, Z-Q', 'Li, Q', 'Si, Y-L', 'Huang, K', 'Ba, J-M', 'Morinaga, H', 'Nomura, M', 'Mu, Y-M']","['Han WD', 'Zhao YL', 'Meng YG', 'Zang L', 'Wu ZQ', 'Li Q', 'Si YL', 'Huang K', 'Ba JM', 'Morinaga H', 'Nomura M', 'Mu YM']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (MACROD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Estrogens/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2007/10/05 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/3/741 [pii]', '10.1677/ERC-06-0082 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2007 Sep;14(3):741-53. doi: 10.1677/ERC-06-0082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that constitutively active STAT5A (ca-STAT5A) can induce a p53- and Rb-dependent cellular senescence response. However, ca-STAT5A did not induce p21 and p16(INK4a), which are responsible for inhibiting cyclin-dependent protein kinases and engaging the Rb pathway during the senescence response to oncogenic ras. Intriguingly, ca-STAT5A led to a down-regulation of Myc and Myc targets, including CDK4, a negative regulator of Rb. The down-regulation of Myc was in part proteasome-dependent and correlated with its localization to promyelocytic leukemia bodies, which were found to be highly abundant during STAT5-induced senescence. Introduction of CDK4 or Myc bypassed STAT5A-induced senescence in cells in which p53 was also inactivated. These results uncover a novel mechanism to engage the Rb pathway in oncogene-induced senescence and indicate the existence of oncogene-specific pathways that regulate senescence.","['Mallette, Frederick A', 'Gaumont-Leclerc, Marie-France', 'Huot, Genevieve', 'Ferbeyre, Gerardo']","['Mallette FA', 'Gaumont-Leclerc MF', 'Huot G', 'Ferbeyre G']","['Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C 3J7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071003,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2007/10/05 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)54630-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M707074200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Nov 30;282(48):34938-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M707074200.

Later studies showed that retroviral integration in the MDS1/EVI1 locus results in the emergence of a non-malignant dominant hematopoietic stem cell clone in non-susceptible mice strains, in non-human primates, and in patients, suggesting that a gene encoded by the locus could affect the self-renewal potential of a cell. The locus encodes two genes. One of them, EVI1, has long been associated with myeloid leukemia. To understand whether EVI1 has a role in self-renewal control, we forcibly expressed EVI1 in the bone marrow progenitors of two mice strains that differ in their proliferation and self-renewal potential. By comparing the response of the hematopoietic cells to EVI1, we conclude that EVI1 has a role in prolonging the self-renewal potential of the cells and that this ability of EVI1 is limited and modulated by inherent characteristics of the cells.","['Laricchia-Robbio, Leopoldo', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Laricchia-Robbio L', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago (M/C 737), 909 South Wolcott Avenue, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. robbiol@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071029,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/*metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2007/10/05 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/10/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00133-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.07.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Mar-Apr;40(2):141-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.07.012.

KITC's influence on the concentration of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, the products of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), was determined using the HPLC method. In addition, we analyzed the effects of KITC treatment on the incorporation of 14C-cytidine into the DNA of tumor cells in order to quantify the loss of RR in situ activity. To reveal a potential value of KITC for supporting conventional chemotherapy, we also examined whether a combination of KITC with arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) could yield synergistic growth inhibitory effects. KITC caused a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis, whereas no remarkable changes of the cell cycle distribution were observed. Incubation with KITC resulted in a significant depletion of intracellular dTTP and dATP pools and was also found to remarkably reduce the in situ activity of RR, the key enzyme of de novo DNA synthesis. In addition, KITC exhibited synergistic combination effects when applied sequentially with Ara-C.

One day after leukemia cell inoculation, mice received twice weekly intravenous injections of L-Grb2. At an injection dose of 15 mg of L-Grb2 per kg of mouse body weight, 80% of mice treated with L-Grb2 survived to 48 days (end of study) whereas 0% of mice treated with the same dose of liposomal control oligonucleotide survived; the mean survival duration of these groups was 44 and 20 days, respectively.

Because mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) requires more than depolarization to occur, antitumor AQs were tested for their ability to directly trigger specific markers of MPT in isolated mitochondria. In contrast to a spectrum of conventional anticancer drugs that are inactive, various AQs interact with isolated mitochondria in a concentration- and time-dependent manner to rapidly cause large amplitude swelling and Ca2+ release in relation with their effectiveness against L1210, HL-60 and LL/2 tumor cells in vitro. Indeed, the lead antitumor AQ8, AQ9 and AQ17 are also the most effective inducers of MPT in isolated mitochondria, whereas all AQ derivatives devoid of anti-proliferative activity also fail to trigger mitochondrial swelling and Ca2+ release. Moreover, the ability of 4 microM AQ17 to maximally induce mitochondrial swelling and Ca2+ release within 15 min is similar to that of classic MPT-inducing agents, such as 5 microg/ml alamethicin, 200 microM atractyloside, 5 microM phenylarsine oxide, 100 microM arsenic trioxide and a 100 microM Ca2+ overload. Interestingly, AQ17 requires a priming concentration of 20 microM Ca2+ to trigger mitochondrial swelling and Ca2+ release and these 0.1 microM ruthenium red-sensitive MPT events are abolished by 1 microM cyclosporin A, 2 mM ADP and 20 microM bongkrekic acid, which block components of the permeability transition pore (PTP), and also inhibited by 50-100 microM of various ubiquinones, which interact with the quinone binding site of the PTP and raise the Ca2+ load required for PTP opening. Hence, antitumor AQs that target isolated mitochondria and trigger MPT might directly interact with components of the PTP to induce conformational changes that increase its Ca2+ sensitivity and transition from the closed to the open state.","['Perchellet, Elisabeth M', 'Wang, Yang', 'Lou, Kaiyan', 'Zhao, Huiping', 'Battina, Srinivas K', 'Hua, Duy H', 'Perchellet, Jean-Pierre H']","['Perchellet EM', 'Wang Y', 'Lou K', 'Zhao H', 'Battina SK', 'Hua DH', 'Perchellet JP']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506-4901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '635-12-1 (1,4-anthraquinone)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/*drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore']",2007/10/04 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/10/04 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Nov;31(5):1231-41.,,,,,"['R01 AG 025500/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 86842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 15563/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using mathematical models, we investigate the effect of cellular quiescence on the outcome of therapy with targeted small molecule inhibitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: According to the models, the initiation of treatment can result in different patterns of tumor cell decline: a biphasic decline, a one-phase decline, and a reverse biphasic decline. A biphasic decline involves a fast initial phase (which roughly corresponds to the eradication of cycling cells by the drug), followed by a second and slower phase of exponential decline (corresponding to awakening and death of quiescent cells), which helps explain clinical data. We define the time when the switch to the second phase occurs, and identify parameters that determine whether therapy can drive the tumor extinct in a reasonable period of time or not. We further ask how cellular quiescence affects the evolution of drug resistance. We find that it has no effect on the probability that resistant mutants exist before therapy if treatment occurs with a single drug, but that quiescence increases the probability of having resistant mutants if patients are treated with a combination of two or more drugs with different targets. Interestingly, while quiescence prolongs the time until therapy reduces the number of cells to low levels or extinction, the therapy phase is irrelevant for the evolution of drug resistant mutants. If treatment fails as a result of resistance, the mutants will have evolved during the tumor growth phase, before the start of therapy. Thus, prevention of resistance is not promoted by reducing the quiescent cell population during therapy (e.g., by a combination of cell activation and drug-mediated killing). CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical models provide insights into the effect of quiescence on the basic kinetics of the response to targeted treatment of CML. They identify determinants of success in the absence of drug resistant mutants, and elucidate how quiescence influences the emergence of drug resistant mutants.","['Komarova, Natalia L', 'Wodarz, Dominik']","['Komarova NL', 'Wodarz D']","['Department of Mathematics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Probability', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Stochastic Processes']",2007/10/04 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/10/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0000990 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2007 Oct 3;2(10):e990. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000990.,,,PMC1991595,,"['R01 AI058153/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1R01AI058153-01A2/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A necessary step when building a classifier for high-dimensional data is feature selection. Feature selection is frequently carried out by computing univariate scores for each feature individually, without consideration for how a subset of features performs as a whole. We introduce a new feature selection approach for high-dimensional nearest centroid classifiers that instead is based on the theoretically optimal choice of a given number of features, which we determine directly here. This allows us to develop a new greedy algorithm to estimate this optimal nearest-centroid classifier with a given number of features. In addition, whereas the centroids are usually formed from maximum likelihood estimates, we investigate the applicability of high-dimensional shrinkage estimates of centroids. We apply the proposed method to clinical classification based on gene-expression microarrays, demonstrating that the proposed method can outperform existing nearest centroid classifiers.","['Dabney, Alan R', 'Storey, John D']","['Dabney AR', 'Storey JD']","['Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, United States of America. adabney@stat.tamu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Child', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Techniques', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated']",2007/10/04 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/10/04 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0001002 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2007 Oct 3;2(10):e1002. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0001002.,,,PMC1991588,,"['R01 HG002913/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 U54 GM2119/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA009168-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NTAL regulates activation of mast cells by a mechanism, which is incompletely understood. Here we report properties of rat basophilic leukemia cells with enhanced or reduced NTAL expression. Overexpression of NTAL led to changes in cell morphology, enhanced formation of actin filaments and inhibition of the FcepsilonRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcepsilonRI subunits, Syk kinase and LAT and all downstream activation events, including calcium and secretory responses. In contrast, reduced expression of NTAL had little effect on early FcepsilonRI-induced signaling events but inhibited calcium mobilization and secretory response. Calcium response was also repressed in Ag-activated cells defective in Grb2, a major target of phosphorylated NTAL. Unexpectedly, in cells stimulated with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase, the amount of cellular NTAL directly correlated with the uptake of extracellular calcium even though no enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of NTAL was observed. The combined data indicate that NTAL regulates FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling at multiple steps and by different mechanisms. At early stages NTAL interferes with tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates and formation of signaling assemblies, whereas at later stages it regulates the activity of store-operated calcium channels through a distinct mechanism independent of enhanced NTAL tyrosine phosphorylation.","['Draberova, Lubica', 'Shaik, Gouse Mohiddin', 'Volna, Petra', 'Heneberg, Petr', 'Tumova, Magda', 'Lebduska, Pavel', 'Korb, Jan', 'Draber, Petr']","['Draberova L', 'Shaik GM', 'Volna P', 'Heneberg P', 'Tumova M', 'Lebduska P', 'Korb J', 'Draber P']","['Department of Signal Transduction, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Amino Acid Transport System y+)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Light Chains)', '0 (LAT2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Slc7a8 protein, rat)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Transport System y+/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Light Chains/*physiology', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",2007/10/04 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/04 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['179/8/5169 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.8.5169 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Oct 15;179(8):5169-80. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.8.5169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an established treatment for certain cancer diagnoses, especially leukaemia. The aim of this study was to investigate physical function and fatigue in relation to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 patients awaiting allogeneic stem cell transplantation were included in a descriptive follow-up design. Fatigue and physical function was assessed by a standardized test programme consisting of a stair test, a test of maximum oxygen uptake and questionnaires on physical activity and fatigue prior to transplantation as well as 3 and 6 months after transplantation. RESULTS: 10 men and 11 women were included. The mean age was 39 years (19-60). Prior to transplantation patients had a low maximum oxygen uptake and reported more fatigue than the Danish general population. Physical fatigue rather than mental fatigue was pronounced both before and after transplantation. No significant changes in the parameters were found from before transplant to 6 months after transplant. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that prior to transplantation patients have poor physical function and increased physical fatigue. The symptoms seem to persist 6 months after transplantation. This could indicate a need for an extensive rehabilitation programme following transplantation.","['Kalo, John', 'Agergard, Josefin', 'Aadahl, Mette', 'Visby, Regitze', 'Kristensen, Jens Halkjaer', 'Jacobsen, Niels']","['Kalo J', 'Agergard J', 'Aadahl M', 'Visby R', 'Kristensen JH', 'Jacobsen N']","['Rigshospitalet, HovedOrtoCentret, Klinik for Medicinsk Ortopaedi & Rehabilitering, Kobenhavn O. kalo@rh.dk']",['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,,IM,"['Adult', 'Exercise/physiology', 'Fatigue/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/physiopathology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Fatigue/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen Consumption/physiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/10/04 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/10/04 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['VP50689 [pii]'],ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2007 Sep 17;169(38):3194-7.,Traethed hos haematologiske patienter behandlet med allogen stamcelletransplantation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More strikingly, patients treated with purine nucleoside analogues (PNA) had a significantly increased risk of subsequent second LPD (5.2%) compared with patients who had not received PNA (1.9%; P = 0.008). No statistically significant association was observed between risk of second LPD and other CLL characteristics (ZAP-70, CD38, IgV(H) mutation status or cytogenetic abnormalities). In this series, prior treatments with PNA or anthracyclines were the only significant factors associated with risk of developing a second LPD in patients with CLL. Physicians should strictly adhere to established criteria to initiate treatment for CLL patients who are not participating in clinical trials.","['Maddocks-Christianson, Kami', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Reinalda, Megan', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Schwager, Susan', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Maddocks-Christianson K', 'Slager SL', 'Zent CS', 'Reinalda M', 'Call TG', 'Habermann TM', 'Bowen DA', 'Hoyer JD', 'Schwager S', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Purine Nucleotides/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",2007/10/04 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/10/04 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6801 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06801.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Nov;139(3):398-404. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06801.x.,,,,,"['CA 113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 94919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we describe the increase in lifespan for people with DS that has occurred over the past 100 years, as well as advances in the understanding of the occurrence of AD in adults with DS. Aspects of the neurobiology of AD, including the role of amyloid, oxidative stress, Cu/ZN dismutase (SOD-1), as well as advances in neuroimaging are presented.

TAL1 and LMO2 operate within multifactorial protein-DNA complexes that regulate gene expression in the developing blood cell. TAL1 is a tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that binds bHLH domains of ubiquitous E-proteins, (E12 and E47), to bind E-box (CANNTG) DNA motifs. TAL1(bHLH) also interacts specifically with the LIM domains of LMO2, which in turn bind Ldb1 (LIM-domain binding protein 1). Here we used biophysical methods to characterize the assembly of a five-component complex containing TAL1, LMO2, Ldb1, E12, and DNA. The bHLH domains of TAL1 and E12 alone primarily formed helical homodimers, but together preferentially formed heterodimers, to which LMO2 bound with high affinity (K(A) approximately 10(8) M(-1)). The resulting TAL1/E12/LMO2 complex formed in the presence or absence of DNA, but the different complexes preferentially bound different Ebox-sequences. Our data provide biophysical evidence for a mechanism, by which LMO2 and TAL1 both regulate transcription in normal blood cell development, and synergistically disrupt E2A function in T-cells to promote the onset of leukaemia.","['Ryan, Daniel P', 'Duncan, Jaimee L', 'Lee, Christopher', 'Kuchel, Philip W', 'Matthews, Jacqueline M']","['Ryan DP', 'Duncan JL', 'Lee C', 'Kuchel PW', 'Matthews JM']","['School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism/physiology', 'Blood Cells', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology', 'Metalloproteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'TCF Transcription Factors/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/10/03 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2007/10/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/prot.21638 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteins. 2008 Mar;70(4):1461-74. doi: 10.1002/prot.21638.,,,,,,,"['2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it is unknown whether mutations of these genes coexist in hyperdiploid cases. We performed mutation analyses of FLT3, NRAS, KRAS, and PTPN11 in a consecutive series of 78 high hyperdiploid ALLs. Twenty-six (33%) of the cases harbored a mutation, comprising six activating point mutations and one internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (7/78 cases; 9.0%), eight codon 12, 13, or 61 NRAS mutations (8/78 cases; 10%), five codon 12 or 13 KRAS mutations (5/78 cases, 6.4%), and seven exon 3 or 13 PTPN11 mutations (7/78 cases; 9.0%).

We hypothesized that microarray studies could identify previously unrecognized expression changes that occur only in AML blasts. We were particularly interested in those genes with increased expression in AML, believing that these genes may be potential therapeutic targets. To test this hypothesis, we compared gene expression profiles between normal hematopoietic cells from 38 healthy donors and leukemic blasts from 26 AML patients. Normal hematopoietic samples included CD34+ selected cells (N = 18), unselected bone marrows (N = 10), and unselected peripheral bloods (N = 10). Twenty genes displayed AML-specific expression changes that were not found in the normal hematopoietic cells. Subsequent analyses using microarray data from 285 additional AML patients confirmed expression changes for 13 of the 20 genes. Seven genes (BIK, CCNA1, FUT4, IL3RA, HOMER3, JAG1, WT1) displayed increased expression in AML, while 6 genes (ALDHA1A, PELO, PLXNC1, PRUNE, SERPINB9, TRIB2) displayed decreased expression. Quantitative RT/PCR studies for the 7 over-expressed genes were performed in an independent set of 9 normal and 21 pediatric AML samples. All 7 over-expressed genes displayed an increased expression in the AML samples compared to normals. Three of the 7 over-expressed genes (WT1, CCNA1, and IL3RA) have already been linked to leukemogenesis and/or AML prognosis, while little is known about the role of the other 4 over-expressed genes in AML.

Abnormal overexpression and downregulation of some CEACAMs have been described in tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies grouped in the CD66 cluster recognize CEACAM members. Ectopic CD66 expression is commonly detected in B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To investigate the CEACAM messenger RNA (RNA) expression in leukemic blasts, we performed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis in purified RNA samples from a consecutive series of acute leukemias (135 patients). Most B-cell lineage ALL expressed CD66 (79.5%), whereas no single case of T-cell lineage ALL disclosed CD66 reactivity (0%). All the BCR-ABL+ ALL cases showed CD66 expression. CD66 was positive even in cases without CD10 expression (72.7%) and/or with MLL rearrangements. Despite the sharp contrast between T-ALL and B-ALL in CD66 reactivity, CEACAM patterns were comparable, and only minor differences for CEACAM1 and CEACAM8 were detected. All the leukemic samples showed overexpression of CEACAM6 and 8 when compared with normal granulocytes. These results were confirmed by dilutional experiments. The leukemic pattern paralleled the normal regenerating bone marrow with lower values for CEACAM1. In line with the results for CD66 reactivity, neoplastic cell lines had a uniform low expression of CEACAM family members.

The discovery of RNA interference in mammalian cells has provided a powerful tool to inhibit the expression of this gene. However, very little is known about the transfection of leukaemia cells with short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted at MDR1. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two chemically-synthesised siRNA in modulating MDR1 gene and inhibiting P-glycoprotein expression in leukaemic cells. We also evaluated two siRNA delivery methods in this study. METHODS: K562/Adr was transfected with two MDR1-targeted siRNA or negative control siRNA, by using cationic lipid-based transfection reagents or electroporator. Gene expression of MDR1 was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and calculated as a percentage relative to the negative control siRNA. P-glycoprotein expression was evaluated via flow cytometry and drug sensitivity after treatment was assessed by cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The percentage of MDR1 gene knockdown from cells transfected with an electroporator was significantly higher (84.4 percent, p-value is 0.094) compared to cells transfected with cationic lipid-based transfection reagents (52.8 percent). Both siRNA significantly reduced the expression of MDR1 by 84.9 percent (p-value is 0.001) and 86.0 percent (p-value is 0.011), respectively.

Many studies have evaluated the role of antifungal prophylaxis in cancer patients, with inconsistent conclusions. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing systemic antifungals with placebo, no intervention, or other antifungal agents for prophylaxis in cancer patients after chemotherapy. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, conference proceedings, and references were searched. Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of trials and extracted data. RESULTS: Sixty-four trials met inclusion criteria. Antifungal prophylaxis decreased all-cause mortality significantly at end of follow-up compared with placebo, no treatment, or nonsystemic antifungals (relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.95). In allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, prophylaxis reduced all-cause mortality (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.85), fungal-related mortality, and documented IFI. In acute leukemia patients, there was a significant reduction in fungal-related mortality and documented IFI, whereas the difference in mortality was only borderline significant (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.06). Prophylaxis with itraconazole suspension reduced documented IFI when compared with fluconazole, with no difference in survival, and at the cost of more adverse events. On the basis of two studies, posaconazole prophylaxis reduced all-cause mortality (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.98), fungal-related mortality, and IFI when compared with fluconazole. CONCLUSION: Antifungal prophylaxis decreases all-cause mortality significantly in patients after chemotherapy. Antifungal prophylaxis should be administered to patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, and should probably be administered to high-risk acute leukemia patients.","['Robenshtok, Eyal', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Goldberg, Elad', 'Weinberger, Miriam', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Leibovici, Leonard', 'Paul, Mical']","['Robenshtok E', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Goldberg E', 'Weinberger M', 'Yeshurun M', 'Leibovici L', 'Paul M']","['Department of Medicine E, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 399 patients with AML in first hematological relapse after HSCT whose treatment did (n = 171) or did not (n = 228) include DLI. After correction for imbalances and established risk factors, the two groups were compared with respect to overall survival. Further, a detailed analysis of risk factors for survival among DLI recipients was performed. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 27 and 40 months, respectively. Estimated survival at 2 years (+/- standard deviation) was 21% +/- 3% for patients receiving DLI and 9% +/- 2% for patients not receiving DLI. After adjustment for differences between the groups, better outcome was associated with age younger than 37 years (P = .008), relapse occurring more than 5 months after HSCT (P < .0001), and use of DLI (P = .04). Among DLI recipients, a lower tumor burden at relapse (< 35% of bone marrow blasts; P = .006), female sex (P = .02), favorable cytogenetics (P = .004), and remission at time of DLI (P < .0001) were predictive for survival in a multivariate analysis. Two-year survival was 56% +/- 10%, if DLI was performed in remission or with favorable karyotype, and 15% +/- 3% if DLI was given in aplasia or with active disease. CONCLUSION: Although further evidence for a graft-versus-leukemia effect by DLI is provided, our results confirm, that the clinical benefit is limited to a minority of patients. Strategies to reduce tumor burden before DLI, as well as alternative treatment options should be investigated in adults with relapsed AML after HSCT.","['Schmid, Christoph', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Fassas, Athanasios', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Gurman, Gunham', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Polge, Emmanuelle', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Schmid C', 'Labopin M', 'Nagler A', 'Bornhauser M', 'Finke J', 'Fassas A', 'Volin L', 'Gurman G', 'Maertens J', 'Bordigoni P', 'Holler E', 'Ehninger G', 'Polge E', 'Gorin NC', 'Kolb HJ', 'Rocha V']","['Department of Medicine II, Klinikum Augsburg, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Augsburg, Germany. christoph.schmid@2med.zk.augsburg-med.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20071001,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/10/03 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.11.6053 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.6053 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov 1;25(31):4938-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.6053.

However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) parameters of chemosensitivity have been restricted mainly to the rapidity of achievement of complete remission (CR) or the assessment of residual leukemic bone marrow blasts during aplasia. We hypothesized that the time to circulating peripheral blood blast clearance, as a potential surrogate for in vivo chemosensitivity, would have prognostic relevance in AML also. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 86 adult patients with AML receiving uniform induction and consolidation chemotherapy, we demonstrate that the time to clearance of circulating blasts during induction chemotherapy is an independent prognostic marker of RFS, superseding other known or established risk factors, including karyotype and number of inductions to achieve CR.","['Elliott, Michelle A', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Letendre, Louis L', 'Wolf, Robert C', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Elliott MA', 'Litzow MR', 'Letendre LL', 'Wolf RC', 'Hanson CA', 'Tefferi A', 'Tallman MS']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. elliott.michelle@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071001,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/10/03 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/10/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52858-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-104091 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Dec 15;110(13):4172-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-104091.

Pretreatment (24 h) of U937 leukemia cells with 7.5 micromol/L sorafenib dramatically increased apoptosis induced by sublethal concentrations of TRAIL/Apo2L (75 ng/mL). Similar interactions were observed in Raji, Jurkat, Karpas, K562, U266 cells, primary acute myelogenous leukemia blasts, but not in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells. Sorafenib/TRAIL-induced cell death was accompanied by mitochondrial injury and release of cytochrome c, Smac, and AIF into the cytosol and caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-8 activation. Sorafenib pretreatment down-regulated Bcl-xL and abrogated Mcl-1 expression, whereas addition of TRAIL sharply increased Bid activation, conformational change of Bak (ccBak) and Bax (ccBax), and Bax translocation. Ectopic Mcl-1 expression significantly attenuated sorafenib/TRAIL-mediated lethality and dramatically reduced ccBak while minimally affecting levels of ccBax. Similarly, inhibition of the receptor-mediated apoptotic cascade with a caspase-8 dominant-negative mutant significantly blocked sorafenib/TRAIL-induced lethality but not Mcl-1 down-regulation or Bak/Bax conformational change, indicating that TRAIL-mediated receptor pathway activation is required for maximal lethality. Sorafenib/TRAIL did not increase expression of DR4/DR5, or recruitment of procaspase-8 or FADD to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), but strikingly increased DISC-associated procaspase-8 activation. Sorafenib also down-regulated cFLIP(L), most likely through a translational mechanism, in association with diminished eIF4E phosphorylation, whereas ectopic expression of cFLIP(L) significantly reduced sorafenib/TRAIL lethality. Together, these results suggest that in human leukemia cells, sorafenib potentiates TRAIL-induced lethality by down-regulating Mcl-1 and cFLIP(L), events that cooperate to engage the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascades, culminating in pronounced mitochondrial injury and apoptosis.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Coe, Stefanie', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Coe S', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzenesulfonates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/10/03 09:00,2007/11/01 09:00,['2007/10/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/19/9490 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0598 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Oct 1;67(19):9490-500. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0598.,,,,,"['CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2018 Mar 15;78(6):1575.

Fbxw7 (or hCdc4), a member of the F-box family of proteins, which are substrate recognition components of the multisubunit ubiquitin ligase SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin-F-box-protein), has been shown to mediate the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of several oncoproteins including cyclin E1, c-Myc, c-Jun, and Notch. The oncogenic potential of Fbxw7 substrates, frequent allelic loss in human cancers, and demonstration that mutation of FBXW7 cooperates with p53 in mouse tumorigenesis have suggested that Fbxw7 could function as a tumor suppressor in human cancer. Here, we carry out an extensive genetic screen of primary tumors to evaluate the role of FBXW7 as a tumor suppressor in human tumorigenesis. Our results indicate that FBXW7 is inactivated by mutation in diverse human cancer types with an overall mutation frequency of approximately 6%. The highest mutation frequencies were found in tumors of the bile duct (cholangiocarcinomas, 35%), blood (T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia, 31%), endometrium (9%), colon (9%), and stomach (6%). Approximately 43% of all mutations occur at two mutational ""hotspots,"" which alter Arg residues (Arg465 and Arg479) that are critical for substrate recognition. Furthermore, we show that Fbxw7Arg465 hotspot mutant can abrogate wild-type Fbxw7 function through a dominant negative mechanism.

It fuses the common MLL N-terminal approximately 1400 amino acids in-frame with >60 different partners without shared characteristics. In addition to the well-characterized activity of MLL in maintaining Hox gene expression, our recent studies established an MLL-E2F axis in orchestrating core cell cycle gene expression including Cyclins. Here, we demonstrate a biphasic expression of MLL conferred by defined windows of degradation mediated by specialized cell cycle E3 ligases. Specifically, SCF(Skp2) and APC(Cdc20) mark MLL for degradation at S phase and late M phase, respectively. Abolished peak expression of MLL incurs corresponding defects in G1/S transition and M-phase progression. Conversely, overexpression of MLL blocks S-phase progression. Remarkably, MLL degradation initiates at its N-terminal approximately 1400 amino acids, and tested prevalent MLL fusions are resistant to degradation. Thus, impaired degradation of MLL fusions likely constitutes the universal mechanism underlying all MLL leukemias. Our data conclude an essential post-translational regulation of MLL by the cell cycle ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) assures the temporal necessity of MLL in coordinating cell cycle progression.","['Liu, Han', 'Cheng, Emily H-Y', 'Hsieh, James J-D']","['Liu H', 'Cheng EH', 'Hsieh JJ']","['Molecular Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Cdc20 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '156288-95-8 (CDC20 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cdc20 Proteins', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2007/10/03 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/10/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['21/19/2385 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1574507 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2007 Oct 1;21(19):2385-98. doi: 10.1101/gad.1574507.,,,PMC1993870,,"['R01 CA119008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA119008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125562/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA125562/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA102594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the cellular signaling pathways controlling the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts are not fully understood. We demonstrate that Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) is required for myoblast proliferation and that it also functions as a checkpoint to prevent myoblasts from premature differentiation. Deliberate knockdown of JAK1 in both primary and immortalized myoblasts induces precocious myogenic differentiation with a concomitant reduction in cell proliferation. This is caused, in part, by an accelerated induction of MyoD, myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2 (MEF2), p21Cip1, and p27Kip1, a faster down-regulation of Id1, and an increase in MEF2-dependent gene transcription. Downstream of JAK1, of all the signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs) present in myoblasts, we find that only STAT1 knockdown promotes myogenic differentiation in both primary and immortalized myoblasts. Leukemia inhibitory factor stimulates myoblast proliferation and represses differentiation via JAK1-STAT1-STAT3. Thus, JAK1-STAT1-STAT3 constitutes a signaling pathway that promotes myoblast proliferation and prevents premature myoblast differentiation.","['Sun, Luguo', 'Ma, Kewei', 'Wang, Haixia', 'Xiao, Fang', 'Gao, Yan', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Wang, Kepeng', 'Gao, Xiang', 'Ip, Nancy', 'Wu, Zhenguo']","['Sun L', 'Ma K', 'Wang H', 'Xiao F', 'Gao Y', 'Zhang W', 'Wang K', 'Gao X', 'Ip N', 'Wu Z']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071001,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (MyoD1 myogenic differentiation protein)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/physiology', 'MyoD Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Myoblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Regeneration', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/10/03 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/10/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200703184 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200703184 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2007 Oct 8;179(1):129-38. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200703184.

On admission the abdominal radiograph showed multiple radio-opaque flecks dispersed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Blood testing showed hemoglobin level 8.7 g/dL and a blood lead level of 112.4 microg/dL. The family interview revealed that the patient had pica-like behavior since childhood. He was a site foreman and had been ingesting pieces of roofing plates for a few weeks. The patient was treated with laxatives and CaNa(2)EDTA therapy was initiated. The blood lead level then dropped to 69.9 microg/dL. The patient received two subsequent courses of oral succimer and the blood lead level decreased to 59 microg/dL 21 days after the first course. The follow-up abdominal X-ray 20 days after the first examination was normal. Four months later, an outpatient follow-up visit showed a blood lead level within normal limits (14.5 microg/dL) and a psychiatric follow-up was initiated. Lead poisoning following the ingestion of lead-containing foreign bodies is particularly rare in adults, while it is sometimes observed in children. Pica behavior is a well-identified risk factor of lead intoxication in children but is quite exceptional in adults, where it is usually considered to be a psychiatric condition. Other unusual sources of lead poisoning include the ingestion of lead bullets, ceramic lead glaze or glazed earthenware, lead-contaminated candies, ethnic or herbal remedies.","['Sabouraud, Sabine', 'Testud, Francois', 'Descotes, Jacques', 'Benevent, Monique', 'Soglu, Gilbert']","['Sabouraud S', 'Testud F', 'Descotes J', 'Benevent M', 'Soglu G']","['Lyon Poison Center, Toxicovigilance Unit, Lyon, France. sabine.sabouraud@chu-lyon.fr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Clin Toxicol (Phila),"Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101241654,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Laxatives)', '2P299V784P (Lead)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)']",IM,"['Abdominal Pain/chemically induced/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Adult', 'Bone Diseases/complications/pathology', 'Chelating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Edetic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Electromyography', 'Humans', 'Laxatives/therapeutic use', 'Lead/blood', 'Lead Poisoning/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Leukemia/complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Pica/*complications/psychology', 'Radiography']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['782732822 [pii]', '10.1080/15563650701639014 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Toxicol (Phila). 2008 Mar;46(3):267-9. doi: 10.1080/15563650701639014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Germany. Odds ratios were estimated by applying conditional logistic regression methods to 470 incident leukemia cases and 1,009 controls. Cases were classified as acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Temporal variation in the impact of smoking on leukemia risk was assessed via exposure time-windows and a spline latency function. RESULTS: Current smokers were at greater risk of ANLL than those who never smoked (OR = 1.65 95% CI: 0.95, 2.87) and a positive trend was observed in ANLL risk with cumulative pack-decades smoked, under a 2-year exposure lag assumption (OR/pack-decade = 1.11 95% CI: 0.96, 1.30). This was primarily due to the association between ANLL and smoking in the period 2 to <10 years prior (OR/pack-decade = 2.72 95% CI: 0.93, 7.99). There was minimal evidence of association between ANLL risk and packs smoked 10 or more years prior. CML and ALL exhibited minimal evidence of association with smoking status. CLL exhibited a positive association with smoking in the periods 2 to <10 years and 10 to <20 years prior to diagnosis although estimates of association were highly imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal pattern of smoking-induced ANLL risk appears to follow a prompt peak in excess incidence that diminishes with time since exposure.","['Richardson, David B', 'Terschuren, Claudia', 'Pohlabeln, Hermann', 'Jockel, Karl-Heinz', 'Hoffmann, Wolfgang']","['Richardson DB', 'Terschuren C', 'Pohlabeln H', 'Jockel KH', 'Hoffmann W']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. david.richardson@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070930,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Time']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-007-9068-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2008 Feb;19(1):43-50. doi: 10.1007/s10552-007-9068-7.

We performed a historical cohort study to investigate whether workers employed in Norway's upstream petroleum industry exposed to crude oil and other products containing benzene have an increased risk of developing various subtypes of hematologic neoplasms. Using the Norwegian Registry of Employers and Employees we included all 27,919 offshore workers registered from 1981 to 2003 and 366,114 referents from the general working population matched by gender, age, and community of residence. The cohort was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway. Workers in the job category ""upstream operator offshore"", having the most extensive contact with crude oil, had an excess risk of hematologic neoplasms (blood and bone marrow) (rate ratio (RR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.19-3.02). This was ascribed to an increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia (RR 2.89, 95% CI: 1.25-6.67) and multiple myeloma (RR 2.49, 95% CI: 1.21-5.13). There were no statistical differences between the groups in respect to non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

To assess the functionally relevant haematopoietic cell contexts for MLL fusions to be tumorigenic, we have generated different lines of mice in which de novo Mll-associated translocations occur. In these models, reciprocal chromosomal translocations occur by means of Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (translocator mice) in different cells of the haematopoietic system (namely haematopoietic stem cells, semi-committed progenitors or committed T or B cells). Translocations between Mll and Enl cause myeloid neoplasias, initiating in stem cells or progenitors while no tumours arose when the translocation was restricted to the B-cell compartment. Despite the absence of tumorigenesis, Mll-Enl translocations did occur and Mll-Enl fusion mRNA was expressed in B-cell-restricted translocators. A permissive cellular environment is therefore required for oncogenicity of Mll-associated translocations since the occurrence of Mll-Enl does not promote unrestricted proliferation in all haematopoietic cellular contexts, consistent with a specific instructive role of the MLL-fusion proteins in leukaemogenesis.","['Cano, F', 'Drynan, L F', 'Pannell, R', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Cano F', 'Drynan LF', 'Pannell R', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071001,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210818 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210818 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Mar 20;27(13):1945-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210818.

This review focuses on clinical results of cord blood transplantation including factors associated with transplantation outcomes for aiding graft selection. Immunological analysis of T cell recovery processes and approaches to cellular therapy using cord blood-derived immune cells are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: To resolve problems with cord blood transplantation, including high toxicity especially in the early phase after transplant and delayed engraftment, a reduced intensity regimen and double cord blood units from different donors are applied. For adequate graft selection, cell dose and human leukocyte antigen compatibility are important to reduce transplant-related toxicity, although the importance of human leukocyte antigen compatibility seems to disappear in leukemia patients because of a possible graft-versus-leukemia effect in a human leukocyte antigen-mismatched setting. Immune reconstitution after cord blood transplantation is also important to reduce the risk of infectious complication. Recent technologies make it possible to generate antigen-specific T cells from naive T cells from cord blood in vitro. SUMMARY: Stem cell sources are now available for almost all leukemia patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: Reduced intensity conditioning has demonstrated the capability to achieve engraftment and to decrease early nonrelapse mortality in older and unfit patients. Most large retrospective studies have demonstrated that reduced intensity conditioning regimens lead to a reduction of nonrelapse mortality in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, but disease relapse is higher than with standard myeloablative conditioning regimens. Chronic graft-versus-host disease has emerged as one of the more powerful variables reducing relapses and improving overall and disease-free survival. The use of in-vivo T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab or antithymocyte globulin reduces acute graft-versus-host disease but appears to have no impact on survival. Hopefully, a new second generation of reduced intensity conditioning will study new strategies for reducing disease relapse with low nonrelapse mortality. SUMMARY: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning allows many patients considered ineligible for standard myeloablative conditioning to benefit from this therapy.

This review focuses on recent studies investigating the role of activated tyrosine kinase signaling in the Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Previously identified tyrosine kinase mutations in chronic myeloid leukemia and other myeloproliferative disorders suggested the possibility that polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis are also caused by activated tyrosine kinases. Recent studies identified an activating mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) in most patients with polycythemia vera and in approximately half of those with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. More recently, activating mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor and in JAK2 exon 12 have been identified in JAK2V617F negative myeloproliferative disorders.

Subsequent studies are needed to elucidate the cause of myeloproliferative disorders without known disease alleles and to determine if inhibition of JAK2 signaling has therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.","['Pikman, Yana', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Pikman Y', 'Levine RL']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis']",2007/10/02 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282f0e20c [doi]', '00001622-200711000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2007 Nov;19(6):628-34. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282f0e20c.,,64,,,['K08HL082677-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on a novel dosing regimen that has achieved significant clinical activity in relapsed, poor-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Binding to human plasma proteins reduces free flavopiridol concentration and makes continuous intravenous infusion dosing ineffective. Pharmacokinetic modeling indicated that administering flavopiridol by a 30-min intravenous bolus followed by a 4-h continuous intravenous infusion would achieve serum concentrations necessary to induce in-vivo apoptosis. Our institution conducted a phase I study in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Dose-limiting toxicity was acute tumor lysis syndrome resulting in fatal hyperkalemia. Careful monitoring and aggressive intervention for hyperkalemia, including hemodialysis if necessary, allowed flavopiridol to be given safely. Nineteen of 42 patients responded (45%), including five of 12 patients (42%) with del(17p13) and 13 of 18 patients (72%) with del(11q22). SUMMARY: Flavopiridol, when administered by a 30-min intravenous bolus followed by a 4-h continuous intravenous infusion, is active in high-risk, refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Careful monitoring and aggressive intervention for tumor lysis syndrome and hyperkalemia is necessary for safe drug administration. Further studies to optimize the dose and schedule of administration, and to study this drug in other hematologic malignancies, are ongoing.","['Christian, Beth A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lin, Thomas S']","['Christian BA', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Lin TS']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Flavonoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2007/10/02 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282efb9da [doi]', '00001622-200711000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2007 Nov;19(6):573-8. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282efb9da.,,51,,,"['1 R21 CA112947-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 U01 CA76576-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated efficacy and safety of a chemotherapy including growth factors, cytarabine, and GO (G-AraMy) in the treatment of poor-prognosis AML in elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three Italian hematology departments from September 2003 to September 2006, 53 elderly patients [median age 69 years (range 65-77)] with untreated or primary refractory/relapsed AML were enrolled on the combination G-AraMy administered according to two consecutive schedules (G-AraMy1 and G-AraMy2), with intensified consolidation in the second. Twenty-three of 53 patients had a secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 57%. The most common adverse event was myelosuppression. Seven patients died in induction (13%). No differences for response rate and toxicity profile were observed between untreated and primary resistant/relapsed patients, de novo AML and sAML, and in the two treatment trials. Median disease-free survival and overall survival were 8 months (range 2-23+) and 9 months (range 2-24+). CONCLUSIONS: G-AraMy therapy may be considered an useful treatment approach for poor-risk elderly AML patients, with a complete remission rate comparable to literature data with reduced side-effects, also in a poor-prognosis population.","['Fianchi, L', 'Pagano, L', 'Leoni, F', 'Storti, S', 'Voso, M T', 'Valentini, C G', 'Rutella, S', 'Scardocci, A', 'Caira, M', 'Gianfaldoni, G', 'Leone, G']","['Fianchi L', 'Pagano L', 'Leoni F', 'Storti S', 'Voso MT', 'Valentini CG', 'Rutella S', 'Scardocci A', 'Caira M', 'Gianfaldoni G', 'Leone G']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy. luana.fianchi@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20070928,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41113-7 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdm451 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Jan;19(1):128-34. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdm451.

Within this growing population of long-term survivors, considerable effort has been put forth to identify treatment-related risks for adverse health-related outcomes, such as exposure to alkylating agents, anthracyclines, radiotherapy, and surgery. Patient sex has been identified as a risk factor for numerous long-term adverse outcomes, with female sex more commonly associated with higher risks. In this article, we review the literature, which generally supports associations between female sex and cognitive dysfunction after cranial irradiation, cardiovascular outcomes, obesity, radiation-associated differences in pubertal timing, development of primary hypothyroidism, breast cancer as a second malignant neoplasm and suggests an increased prevalence for the development of osteonecrosis among females. Results of this review support future investigations to further define sex as a risk factor for other common treatment-specific exposures and outcomes. Additionally, research should focus on understanding the underlying biologic and physiological basis of these sex-specific risks. Historically, evidence from both basic science and clinical research has been used to develop risk-stratified therapy, allowing reduction of toxic therapies to low-risk patients without compromising overall survival. With greater knowledge of sex-specific risks, the potential application of sex-specific therapy designed to avoid poor long-term adverse outcomes may become a viable strategy.","['Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Armstrong GT', 'Sklar CA', 'Hudson MM', 'Robison LL']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. greg.armstrong@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data']",2007/10/02 09:00,2007/10/19 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/28/4477 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.2003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 1;25(28):4477-89. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.2003.,,164,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests that patient-tailored dosing may be more rational than a fixed dose for all. Dose optimization potentially could be based on accurate measurement of the level of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition achieved in vivo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In vivo kinase inhibition was measured by calculating the reduction in protein (p)--Crkl level in mononuclear blood cells taken from 49 CML patients at weekly intervals after imatinib therapy was commenced. RESULTS: Greater than 50% inhibition (> 50% reduction in p-Crkl from baseline) was achieved by 21% of patients by days 7 to 14 (and maintained in all patients on days 21 to 28) and an additional 24% of patients achieved more than 50% inhibition by days 21 to 28. Thus, overall 45% of patients achieved more than 50% inhibition. All of these patients achieved major molecular responses by 24 months compared with 56% of the patients who failed to achieve 50% kinase inhibition (P < .001). Patients with less than 50% kinase inhibition were also more likely to have suboptimal responses. CONCLUSION: In vivo BCR-ABL kinase inhibition can be assessed in the first month of imatinib therapy and may provide a valuable guide to optimization of dosage. The extent of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition is an excellent predictor of cytogenetic and molecular response. These observations suggest that dose adjustment based on in vivo measurements of drug-induced target inhibition could be applied in settings beyond imatinib and may be a more effective approach than using one dose for all patients in targeted anticancer therapy.","['White, Deborah', 'Saunders, Verity', 'Grigg, Andrew', 'Arthur, Chris', 'Filshie, Robin', 'Leahy, Michael F', 'Lynch, Kevin', 'To, L Bik', 'Hughes, Timothy']","['White D', 'Saunders V', 'Grigg A', 'Arthur C', 'Filshie R', 'Leahy MF', 'Lynch K', 'To LB', 'Hughes T']","['Division of Hematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia. deb.white@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2007/10/02 09:00,2007/10/19 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/28/4445 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.09.9499 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 1;25(28):4445-51. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.9499.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the presence and extent of paradoxical vasoconstriction in hearts from normal and diabetic rats and to determine whether increased heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression and HO activity, using cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), attenuates coronary microvascular response, male Wistar rats were rendered diabetic with nicotinamide/streptozotocin for 2 wk and either CoPP or vehicle was administered by intraperitoneal injection weekly for 3 wk (0.5 mg/100 g body wt). The isolated beating nonworking heart was submitted to transient low perfusion pressure (20 mmHg), and coronary resistance (CR) was measured. During low perfusion pressure, CR increased and was associated with increased lactate release. In diabetic rats, CR was higher, HO-1 expression and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were downregulated, and inducible nitric oxide synthase and O(2)(-) were upregulated. After 3 wk of CoPP treatment, HO activity was significantly increased in the heart. Upregulation of HO-1 expression and HO activity by CoPP resulted in the abolition of paradoxical vasoconstriction and a reduction in oxidative ischemic damage. In addition, there was a marked increase in serum adiponectin. Elevated HO-1 expression was associated with increased expression of cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthase, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma extra long, and phospho activator protein kinase levels and decreased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and malondialdehyde. These results suggest a critical role for HO-1 in microvascular tone control and myocardial protection during ischemia in both normal and mildly diabetic rats through the modulation of constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and activity, and an increase in serum adiponectin.","[""L'Abbate, Antonio"", 'Neglia, Danilo', 'Vecoli, Cecilia', 'Novelli, Michela', 'Ottaviano, Virginia', 'Baldi, Simona', 'Barsacchi, Renata', 'Paolicchi, Aldo', 'Masiello, Pellegrino', 'Drummond, George S', 'McClung, John A', 'Abraham, Nader G']","[""L'Abbate A"", 'Neglia D', 'Vecoli C', 'Novelli M', 'Ottaviano V', 'Baldi S', 'Barsacchi R', 'Paolicchi A', 'Masiello P', 'Drummond GS', 'McClung JA', 'Abraham NG']","[""Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology, University of Pisa, Pisa 56124, Italy. segrlabb@ifc.cnr.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070928,United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The ability of integrated proviruses to affect gene expression over long distances combined with the lack of methods to determine the expression levels of large numbers of genes in a systematic and truly quantitative manner have limited the identification of cancer genes by proviral insertional mutagenesis. Here, we have characterized a new model of proviral insertional mutagenesis-induced lymphoid tumors derived from Eed Polycomb group gene mutant mice and quantitatively determined the expression levels of all genes within 100 kb of 20 different retroviral common insertion sites (CISs) identified in these tumors. Using high-throughput quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR), we document an average of 13 CIS-associated genes deregulated per tumor, half of which are leukemia subtype-specific, while the others are coordinately deregulated in the majority of tumors analyzed. Interestingly, we find that genes located distantly from common proviral integration sites are as frequently deregulated as proximal genes, with multiple genes affected per integration. Our studies reveal an unsuspected conservation in the group of genes deregulated among phenotypically similar subtypes of lymphoid leukemias, and suggest that identification of common molecular determinants of this disease is within reach.","['Sauvageau, Martin', 'Miller, Michelle', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Lessard, Julie', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Sauvageau M', 'Miller M', 'Lemieux S', 'Lessard J', 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G']","['Molecular Genetics of Stem Cells Laboratory, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, and Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070928,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Eed protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48498-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-098236 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):790-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-098236.

The majority of MLL gene rearrangements are associated with infant ALL, and their presence predicts a poor prognosis which worsens with earlier age of presentation. Rearrangements of the MLL gene are found in most cases of infant AML and regardless of age confer an intermediate risk. The treatment of MLL-rearranged ALL in children involves increased intensification of chemotherapy, and infants with ALL are treated with an intensive regimen of ALL- and AML-like chemotherapy, with the proportion of MLL-rearranged cases being responsible for the poor outcome in this age group. The use of DNA microarray analysis to distinguish a particular gene signature for MLL-rearranged leukemias is shedding light on the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets of these leukemias. It may also prove to have a useful role in both diagnosis and prognosis.

Since our first successful pilot study, our efforts have concentrated on developing new conditioning regimens, optimising the graft processing and improving the post-transplant immunological recovery. The results we have so far achieved in more than 200 high-risk acute leukaemia patients show that haploidentical transplantation is now a clinical reality.

Other enzymes of the family are involved in cytokine maturation along inflammatory response. In recent years, several caspases involved in cell death were shown to play a role in other cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge of the role of caspases in the differentiation of erythroid cells and macrophages. Based on these two examples, we show that the nature of involved enzymes, the pathways leading to their activation in response to specific growth factors, and the specificity of the target proteins that are cleaved by the activated enzymes strongly differ from one cell type to another. Deregulation of these pathways is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of low-grade myelodysplastic syndromes, characterized by excessive activation of caspases and erythroid precursor apoptosis, and that of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, characterized by a defective activation of caspases in monocytes exposed to M-CSF, which blocks their differentiation.","['Droin, Nathalie', 'Cathelin, Severine', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Guery, Leslie', 'Garrido, Carmen', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Solary, Eric']","['Droin N', 'Cathelin S', 'Jacquel A', 'Guery L', 'Garrido C', 'Fontenay M', 'Hermine O', 'Solary E']","['INSERM, UMR 866, F-21079 Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20070902,France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*enzymology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Monocytes/enzymology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*enzymology']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(07)00217-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2007.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2008 Feb;90(2):416-22. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2007.08.007.

Therefore it is important to computationally discriminate between horizontal transferred genes and normal genes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for identifying horizontal transferred genes. This method, which relies on a gene's nucleotide composition and hence obviates the need for knowledge of codon boundaries, is able to detect the horizontal transferred genes with an accuracy of higher than 90% within a reasonable length of time by using just a common PC. With this method, 141 putative transferred genes in mammalian herpesvirus were identified. Among them, 16 genes had been predicted or reported to have cellular homologues in previous papers, including those involved in immune systems and apoptosis such as GCR in EHV-2, BCL-2 (Bcelllymphoma/leukemia-2) homologue in MuHV-4, etc., and had been suggested being acquired from other organisms. Other 125 genes were identified for the first time. Twelve of the newly identified putative transferred genes had also been reported to participate in immune response, apoptosis, cell proliferation control or virulence determinant. Moreover, 42 of the 141 putative transferred genes were found to have non-virus homologues and so were convincingly revealed as transferred genes. Nine of the 42 transferred genes were phylogenetically analyzed, the origin and the relative origin time of which were discussed.","['Fu, Minghui', 'Deng, Riqiang', 'Wang, Jinwen', 'Wang, Xunzhang']","['Fu M', 'Deng R', 'Wang J', 'Wang X']","['State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Science, Sun Yat-Sen Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071001,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,,IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', '*Gene Transfer, Horizontal', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genomics/methods', '*Herpesviridae', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/05/03 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-1702(07)00322-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2007.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2008 Jan;131(1):65-76. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2007.08.009.

Early diagnosis and early antifungal therapy are critical in improving the prognosis for these patients. The diagnosis of invasive fungal infections is, in many cases, not straightforward and requires invasive procedures so that histological examination and culture can be performed. Furthermore, current traditional microbiological tests (ie, cultures and stains) lack the sensitivity for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. PURPOSE: To present a case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus spp diagnosed using a novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: Aspergillus DNA was detected in DNA extracted from the necrotic bone tissue by using a ""panfungal"" PCR novel method. RESULTS: Treatment with voriconazole was started based on the diagnosis.

We also found in this study that FAS was expressed in a number of cancer cell lines of different histotypes. The growth-inhibitory effects of FAS inhibitors cerulenin and C75 were then investigated on these cancer cell lines, particularly the human melanoma A-375. MTT assay revealed that the cancer cell proliferation and viability was reduced dose- and time-dependently by 20.8%-87.1% of the control levels after 24 and 48 h of treatment with 20-160 microM of the inhibitor. Immunoblotting studies showed that both cerulenin and C75 induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in the melanoma cells dose-dependently. Procaspase-3 was also found to be processed into the active and smaller 17 and 19 kDa subunits, and administration of pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK completely rescued the cells from PARP cleavage. This indicated that the cerulenin- and C75-induced apoptosis involved caspase activation. The proapoptotic effects of the FAS inhibitors were further confirmed using confocal microscopy with annexin-V FITC and propidium iodide staining. DNA flow cytometric studies demonstrated that the FAS inhibitors accumulated G2/M cells preceding the elevation of sub G1 or apoptotic cells with fragmented DNA. The induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were associated with elevation of p21 and depletion of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, respectively. Results from this study suggest that FAS inhibitors retard growth of melanoma A-375 cells, involving activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis.","['Ho, Tik-Shun', 'Ho, Yuk-Ping', 'Wong, Wing-Yin', 'Chi-Ming Chiu, Lawrence', 'Wong, Yum-Shing', 'Eng-Choon Ooi, Vincent']","['Ho TS', 'Ho YP', 'Wong WY', 'Chi-Ming Chiu L', 'Wong YS', 'Eng-Choon Ooi V']","['Department of Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong SAR.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070914,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (4-methylene-2-octyl-5-oxofuran-3-carboxylic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '17397-89-6 (Cerulenin)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (Fatty Acid Synthases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'OL659KIY4X (4-Butyrolactone)']",IM,"['4-Butyrolactone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cerulenin/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acid Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, bcl-2/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(07)00189-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2007.08.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2007 Oct;61(9):578-87. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2007.08.020.

Housekeeping (Hk) genes are essential in these analyses as internal controls for normalizing expression levels evaluated with Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR). Ideal Hk genes are constitutively expressed, do not respond to external stimuli and exhibit little or no sample-to-sample or run-to-run variation. Previous studies indicate that some commonly used Hk genes including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and beta-actin have differential expression in various cell lines. Here we examine the expression of 11 Hk genes in four normal human lymphoblastoid cell lines and one T-cell leukemia (Jurkat) cell line following exposure to graded doses of ionizing radiation or to varying ratio concentrations of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PHA and PMA are known to have synergistic effects on the expression of some genes and have very different effects from those of radiation. There has been no systematic study performed to ascertain the best control genes for radiation and/or PHA/PMA exposures in lymphoblastoid cells. Using a two-step reverse-transcriptase RT-PCR protocol we show that following radiation doses ranging from 0 to 400 cGy, 18S rRNA, acidic ribosomal protein, beta-actin, cyclophilin, GAPDH, phosphoglycerokinase, beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), beta-glucuronidase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and transferrin receptor showed no significant variation in expression in normal lymphoblastoid cells. In contrast, only 18S rRNA levels were unchanged in Jurkat cells. After PHA/PMA treatment of the same normal cell lines, B2M showed no significant variation and 18S rRNA, GAPDH and transcription binding protein (TBP) were minimally responsive, whereas in Jurkat cells all these genes were unresponsive. While our results suggest that the utility of a particular Hk gene should be determined for each experimental condition, 18S rRNA and B2M appear to be excellent candidates for use as internal controls in RT-PCR in human lymphoblastoid cells because they have the most constant levels of expression across cell lines following exposure to ionizing radiation as well as to PHA/PMA.","['Banda, Malathi', 'Bommineni, Aryamani', 'Thomas, Robert A', 'Luckinbill, Leo S', 'Tucker, James D']","['Banda M', 'Bommineni A', 'Thomas RA', 'Luckinbill LS', 'Tucker JD']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",20070819,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 18S)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclophilins/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Glucuronidase/genetics', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S/genetics', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects/*radiation effects']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(07)00267-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2008 Jan 8;649(1-2):126-34. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.08.005.

More than 50% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis and usually require no treatment. However, treatment is needed in the advanced and progressive disease. Chlorambucil with or without steroids has been the drug of choice for many years in previously untreated patients with CLL. The purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs), fludarabine (FA), cladribine (2-CdA-chlorodeoxyadenosine) and pentostatin (DCF, 2'-deoxycoformycin) also have been introduced for treatment of CLL. Significantly higher overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) and longer progression free survival (PFS) in patients with CLL treated with FA or 2-CdA have been confirmed in randomized, multicenter trials and more recently in meta-analysis. However, the median survival time did not differ between patients treated with PNA and alkylating agents. Combination therapies with PNAs and cyclophosphamide and especially with cyclophosphamide and rituximab are more active than monotherapy in terms of OR, CR and PFS. Several reports have shown significant activity of alemtuzumab in previously untreated and pretreated patients even when refractory to FA. Alemtuzumab also can be used in CLL as a preparative regimen before stem cell transplantation (SCT) and to eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD). Recently, several new agents have shown promise in treating CLL, including new monoclonal antibodies, agents targeting bcl-2 family of proteins, antisense oligonucleotides and other agents. Moreover, autologous and allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantations are increasingly considered for treatment of patients with CLL.

However, recent incidences of T cell leukemia in X-SCID children receiving gene therapy reveal discrepancy among the preclinical and clinical studies. Divergent results on the potential oncogenic property of integrating vectors obtained from different animal models further raise concern about the relevance and sensitivity of available preclinical systems used to assess their toxicity. Evaluation of transcriptional responses to vector transduction in different in vivo models may provide us with early indications of the potential adverse effects of these vectors and comparative information on the sensitivity and suitability of these models. For this purpose, we used cDNA microarray to examine transcriptional changes in BALB/c and CD-1 (IRC) mice, the two common murine strains used in pharmacological and toxicological studies. Our results revealed a significant difference in the transcriptional responses to vector transduction between the two mouse strains. Modest gene changes, in terms of gene numbers and gene expression were observed in BALB/c mice, whereby expression of 15 oncogenes was up-regulated in CD-1 (ICR) mice.

It is tempting to speculate that RdTS plays a role in retroviral gene silencing, considering that retroviral RNA transcripts harbor a U3 promoter sequence that is a potentially good source of double-stranded RNAs. To test this possibility, we constructed several model HeLaS3 cell lines expressing GFP driven by murine leukaemia virus (MLV)-long terminal repeat (LTR) and introduced a series of shRNAs that target the U3 region of the MLV-LTR. However, transcriptional gene silencing was not induced in most instances, in spite of the fact that processed shRNA was found in cellular nuclei, indicating that RdTS does not contribute to MLV gene silencing in host cells.","['Haraguchi, Takeshi', 'Mizutani, Taketoshi', 'Yamamichi, Nobutake', 'Ito, Taiji', 'Minoguchi, Shigeru', 'Iba, Hideo']","['Haraguchi T', 'Mizutani T', 'Yamamichi N', 'Ito T', 'Minoguchi S', 'Iba H']","['Division of Host-Parasite Interaction, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070924,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (RASSF1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2007/10/02 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/10/02 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(07)01010-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.09.028 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2007 Oct 16;581(25):4949-54. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2007.09.028.

In addition, to evaluate the role of MRI in the assessment of hip joint involvement in different clinical settings that may share similar clinical findings. Thirty-four patients who complained of hip pain were studied consecutively. Of these, 21 were men (61.8%) and 13 were women (38.2%). After clinical assessment of possible hip disease, plain radiograph and MRI study of both hips were performed. The literature was searched using keywords: bone marrow edema, hip, and MRI. All patients had antalgic gait and limping. Initial clinical examination revealed painful limited internal and external rotation of the affected hip/hips suspect for hip disease. Unilateral hip involvement was identified in 31 patients (91.2%), and bilateral hip involvement was found in three patients (8.8%), with a total of 37 hips evaluated by MRI. The final diagnoses in our patients were: reactive arthritis (1), transient osteoporosis (7), avascular necrosis (10), osteoarthritis (2), tuberculous arthritis (4), septic arthritis (2), osteomyelitis (2), sickle cell anemia (2), lymphocytic leukemia (1), and femoral stress fracture (3). Bone marrow edema affecting the hip is neither a specific MR imaging finding nor a specific diagnosis and may be encountered in a variety of hip disorders due to different etiologies. MR imaging is the modality of choice when clinical examination is suspect for hip disease and plain radiographs are normal or equivocal. Early diagnosis and treatment is important in many of the disorders. The literature is reviewed regarding bone marrow edema of the hip.","['Ragab, Yasser', 'Emad, Yasser', 'Abou-Zeid, Alaa']","['Ragab Y', 'Emad Y', 'Abou-Zeid A']","['Radiodiagnosis Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20070928,Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Arthritis/complications/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Femur Head Necrosis/complications/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Hip Joint/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteomyelitis/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Osteoporosis/complications/diagnosis/*pathology']",2007/09/29 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2007/09/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10067-007-0731-x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2008 Apr;27(4):475-82. doi: 10.1007/s10067-007-0731-x.

Studies have shown that the biosynthesis of cholesterol and cholesterol esters interfere with the function of P-gp. Since low density lipoprotein (LDL) carries a large amount of cholesterol, we investigated the effect of cholesterol derived from LDL on a line of human lymphoblastic leukemia MDR cells, CEM/VLB. Our results demonstrated that, in addition to increased cytotoxicity, the uptake of vinblastine in CEM/VLB cells increased, and LDL subsequently increased the intracellular vinblastine concentrations retained by CEM/VLB cells. The cholesterol levels in the membrane of the MDR cells were restored, while LDL significantly decreased the P-gp-associated ATPase activity. Current studies have shown that LDL leads to the resensitization of CEM/VLB cells to cytotoxic agents, likely through the restoration of cholesterol and reduction of P-gp-associated ATPase in the cell membrane.","['Shu, Yu', 'Liu, Hu']","['Shu Y', 'Liu H']","[""School of Pharmacy, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NL A1B 3V6, [corrected] Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Cholesterol/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Vinblastine/*metabolism/toxicity']",2007/09/29 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/09/29 09:00'],"['2007/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['o07-065 [pii]', '10.1139/o07-065 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2007 Oct;85(5):638-46. doi: 10.1139/o07-065.,,,,,,,,,,,['Biochem Cell Biol. 2008 Feb;86(1):79'],,,,,,,,

To examine the histopathological and functional consequence of the persistent inhibition of GSK-3beta in the heart in vivo, we generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of dominant negative GSK-3beta (Tg-GSK-3beta-DN) and tetracycline-regulatable wild-type GSK-3beta. GSK-3beta-DN significantly reduced the kinase activity of endogenous GSK-3beta, inhibited phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B epsilon, and induced accumulation of beta-catenin and myeloid cell leukemia-1, confirming that GSK-3beta-DN acts as a dominant negative in vivo. Tg-GSK-3beta-DN exhibited concentric hypertrophy at baseline, accompanied by upregulation of the alpha-myosin heavy chain gene and increases in cardiac function, as evidenced by a significantly greater Emax after dobutamine infusion and percentage of contraction in isolated cardiac myocytes, indicating that inhibition of GSK-3beta induces well-compensated hypertrophy. Although transverse aortic constriction induced a similar increase in hypertrophy in both Tg-GSK-3beta-DN and nontransgenic mice, Tg-GSK-3beta-DN exhibited better left ventricular function and less fibrosis and apoptosis than nontransgenic mice. Induction of the GSK-3beta transgene in tetracycline-regulatable wild-type GSK-3beta mice induced left ventricular dysfunction and premature death, accompanied by increases in apoptosis and fibrosis. Overexpression of GSK-3beta-DN in cardiac myocytes inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis, and the antiapoptotic effect of GSK-3beta-DN was abrogated in the absence of myeloid cell leukemia-1. These results suggest that persistent inhibition of GSK-3beta induces compensatory hypertrophy, inhibits apoptosis and fibrosis, and increases cardiac contractility and that the antiapoptotic effect of GSK-3beta inhibition is mediated by myeloid cell leukemia-1. Thus, downregulation of GSK-3beta during heart failure could be compensatory.","['Hirotani, Shinichi', 'Zhai, Peiyong', 'Tomita, Hideharu', 'Galeotti, Jonathan', 'Marquez, Juan Pablo', 'Gao, Shumin', 'Hong, Chull', 'Yatani, Atsuko', 'Avila, Jesus', 'Sadoshima, Junichi']","['Hirotani S', 'Zhai P', 'Tomita H', 'Galeotti J', 'Marquez JP', 'Gao S', 'Hong C', 'Yatani A', 'Avila J', 'Sadoshima J']","['Cardiovascular Research Institute, UMDNJ, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070927,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cardiomegaly/etiology', 'Cardiotonic Agents', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fibrosis/etiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Heart Failure/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myocardial Contraction', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology']",2007/09/29 09:00,2008/01/26 09:00,['2007/09/29 09:00'],"['2007/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['CIRCRESAHA.107.160614 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.160614 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2007 Nov 26;101(11):1164-74. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.160614.

To study this question, we analyzed blood cell development in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Ts65Dn mice are trisomic for 104 orthologs of Hsa21 genes and are the most widely used mouse model for DS. We discovered that Ts65Dn mice display persistent macrocytosis and develop a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) characterized by profound thrombocytosis, megakaryocyte hyperplasia, dysplastic megakaryocyte morphology, and myelofibrosis. In addition, these animals bear distorted hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor cell compartments compared with euploid control littermates. Of the 104 trisomic genes in Ts65Dn mice, Aml1/Runx1 attracts considerable attention as a candidate oncogene in DS-acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL). To determine whether trisomy for Aml1/Runx1 is essential for MPD, we restored disomy at the Aml1/Runx1 locus in the Ts65Dn strain. Surprisingly, trisomy for Aml1/Runx1 is not required for megakaryocyte hyperplasia and myelofibrosis, suggesting that trisomy for one or more of the remaining genes can promote this disease. Our studies demonstrate the potential of DS mouse models to improve our understanding of chromosome 21 gene dosage effects in human hematologic malignancies.","['Kirsammer, Gina', 'Jilani, Sarah', 'Liu, Hui', 'Davis, Elizabeth', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Crispino, John D']","['Kirsammer G', 'Jilani S', 'Liu H', 'Davis E', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Le Beau MM', 'Crispino JD']","['Ben May Department for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070927,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Trisomy/*genetics/pathology']",2007/09/29 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/09/29 09:00'],"['2007/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48495-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-085670 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):767-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-085670.

Twin studies and retrospective screening of neonatal blood spots provide evidence that fusion genes and other chromosomal abnormalities associated with pediatric leukemias can originate prenatally. Whether this is also the case for NOTCH1 mutations is unknown. Eleven cases of T-ALL were screened for NOTCH1 mutations and 4 (36%) had mutations in either the heterodimerization (HD) or proline glutamic acid/serine/threonine (PEST) domains. Of these 4, 3 could be amplified by mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction primers. In one of these 3, with the highest sensitivity, NOTCH1 mutation was detected in neonatal blood spots. In this patient, the blood spot was negative for SIL-TAL1 fusion, present concomitant with NOTCH1 mutation, in the diagnostic sample.

The strongest evidence of association came from the A-T haplotype from rs963248-rs2891980 (P = 0.008). For XRCC5, the genotype GG from rs1051685 was detected in 10 cases from different national populations but in only one control (P = 0.015). This SNP is located in the 3'-UTR of XRCC5.

This study was conducted to determine the prognoses and treatment outcomes of patients with AML with this unique cytogenetic change. A total of 22 patients with AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22) were studied. Various parameters were tested for their impact on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Another 55 patients with AML with a normal karyotype were included for comparison of clinical outcomes. Between patients with t(8-21) and those with a normal karyotype, no significant differences were noted in DFS (median survival, 15.23 vs 12.03 mo; P=.7626) and OS (median survival, 19.17 vs 18.93 mo; P=.7543). Among t(8;21)(q22;q22) patients, no clinical parameters showed a significant impact on DFS. Univariate analysis revealed that a higher platelet count (>15.10(9)/L) at diagnosis, a low white blood cell count (index < or =20), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as postremission therapy were associated with improved OS. On multivariate analysis, HSCT as postremission therapy and white blood cell count index <20 remained good independent prognostic factors for OS. The data presented here suggest that t(8;21)(q22;q22) cytogenetic changes in patients with AML had prognostic significance similar to that in patients with a normal karyotype; patients who harbored either karyotype had parallel clinical outcomes.

The upregulation of telomerase activity in tumours has been reported in humans and some mammals and is considered to be a tumour marker; however, such activity has not been investigated in cows. Therefore, we investigated telomerase activity in bovine leukaemia, the most common tumour in cows and its relationship with the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infection, which is the major cause of leukaemia. Telomerase activity was detected in 25 of 29 bovine leukaemia tissue samples. In peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from BLV-infected cases that did not develop the tumour, telomerase activity was detected in 11 of 71 cases (15.5%). When these cases were classified based on serological tests and the peripheral blood lymphocyte count, the telomerase activity was observed to be the highest in the seropositive, non-lymphoproliferative (PBL<8000 microl(-1)) cases (three of seven cases, 42.9%), and not observed in the lymphoproliferative cases (PBL<16,000 microl(-1)) except in one case. Although the precise pathogenesis of BLV-related diseases remains obscure, persistent lymphocytosis is considered as a pre-neoplastic state. In contrast, our results suggested that given the fact that telomerase activity indicates tumour development, the aleukaemic stage could be defined as the 'pre-neoplastic state'. In conclusion, similar to many tumours in humans, telomerase activity was detected in bovine leukaemia; further, this activity can be a potentially useful prediction marker for tumour development and/or a good therapeutic target.","['Suzuki, Kazuhiko', 'Shuto, Seiko', 'Miura, Yasuo', 'Sentsui, Hiroshi']","['Suzuki K', 'Shuto S', 'Miura Y', 'Sentsui H']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, College of Bioresource Sciences, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan. suzuki.kazuhiko@nihon-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070817,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*enzymology/*virology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Count/veterinary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",2007/09/29 09:00,2008/11/06 09:00,['2007/09/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1135(07)00407-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2008 Feb 5;127(1-2):142-6. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.08.016.

Here we present a rapid, simple and versatile method for isolation of PM sheets from non-adherent cells, and show its use for examination of the topography of Fcepsilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI) and transmembrane adaptors, LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and NTAL (non-T cell activation linker), in murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC). The data were compared with those obtained from widely used but tumor-derived rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. In non-activated cells, FcepsilonRI was distributed either individually or in small clusters of comparable size in both cell types. In multivalent antigen-activated BMMC as well as RBL cells, FcepsilonRI was internalized to a similar extent, but, strikingly, internalization in BMMC was not preceded by formation of large (~200 nm) aggregates of FcepsilonRI, described previously in activated RBL cells. On the other hand, downstream adaptor proteins, LAT and NTAL, were localized in independent domains in both BMMC and RBL cells before and after FcepsilonRI triggering. The combined data demonstrate unexpected properties of FcepsilonRI signaling assemblies in BMMC and emphasize the importance of studies of PM sheets isolated from non-tumor cells.","['Lebduska, Pavel', 'Korb, Jan', 'Tumova, Magda', 'Heneberg, Petr', 'Draber, Petr']","['Lebduska P', 'Korb J', 'Tumova M', 'Heneberg P', 'Draber P']","['Department of Signal Transduction, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, vvi, Videnska 1083, 142 20, Prague 4, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070918,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*ultrastructure', '*Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/*ultrastructure']",2007/09/29 09:00,2008/01/01 09:00,['2007/09/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(07)00284-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2007.08.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2007 Dec 1;328(1-2):139-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2007.08.015.

The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib induces cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis via the conversion of FKHRL1 from the phosphorylated inactive form to the dephosphorylated active form in CML-derived cell lines. In the present study, we examined whether active FKHRL1 can overcome resistance to imatinib. To this end, we generated a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible active FKHRL1 (FKHRL1-TM; a triple mutant of FKHRL1 in which all three Akt phosphorylation sites have been mutated)-estrogen receptor fusion protein expression system in CML-derived imatinib-resistant cell lines. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen inhibited cell growth and cell cycle progression, and subsequently induced apoptosis, accompanied by upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Thus, active FKHRL1 antagonized deregulated proliferation and induced apoptosis in these cell lines. In addition, imatinib-resistant cells underwent apoptosis after transfection with full-length TRAIL cDNA. Collectively, our results suggest that active FKHRL1 can overcome imatinib resistance in CML cells, in part via TRAIL production.","['Kikuchi, Satoru', 'Nagai, Tadashi', 'Kunitama, Masae', 'Kirito, Keita', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Kikuchi S', 'Nagai T', 'Kunitama M', 'Kirito K', 'Ozawa K', 'Komatsu N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi-ken 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070926,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2007/09/29 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/09/29 09:00'],"['2007/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS623 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00623.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Dec;98(12):1949-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00623.x.

The pathological features of the lymph nodes of ATLL change from those of lymphadenitis to Hodgkin's-like features and those of lymphoma. Chemokines and their receptors are closely associated with T-cell subgroups and immune responses. To clarify the relationship between chemokines and their receptor expression, as well as the development of ATLL, 17 cases with ATLL were analyzed using DNA chips of chemokines and their receptors. All cases showed a varied and mixed pattern of upregulated and downregulated gene expression of Th1, Th2, naive, and cytotoxic cell-associated chemokine genes. As CC chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) accounted for the most upregulated gene and CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) for the most downregulated gene, they were selected for immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical staining showed expression of the two genes in immunological cells, with a positive expression for reticulum cells, but not for ATLL cells. HTLV-1-associated lymphadenitis type (n = 13) and Hodgkin's-like type (n = 12) cases showed significantly higher CCL18 expression than the non-specific lymphadenitis cases (n = 10) (P < 0.05). However, all HTLV-1-associated cases showed significantly lower CX3CR1 expression than the non-specific lymphadenitis cases (P < 0.05).

Stimulation with BMP-6 exerted an antiproliferative effect that was counteracted by inhibitor of DNA binding (Id)1 siRNA, indicating that Id1 is an important downstream mediator in Jurkat TAg cells. A subset of CD4(+) T cells were found to express the BMP receptors Alk-2 and Alk-3 (type I), in addition to BMPRII (type II). BMP-6 also induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, followed by transcriptional increase in ID1-ID3 mRNA expression. However, we did not observe significant changes in Id protein expression in CD4(+) T cells. Altogether, the data indicate a role for BMP-6 in human T lineage cells.","['Sivertsen, Einar A', 'Huse, Kanutte', 'Hystad, Marit E', 'Kersten, Christian', 'Smeland, Erlend B', 'Myklebust, June H']","['Sivertsen EA', 'Huse K', 'Hystad ME', 'Kersten C', 'Smeland EB', 'Myklebust JH']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Cancer Research, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet Medical Centre, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (BMP6 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors)']",IM,"['Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",2007/09/28 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200636759 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2007 Oct;37(10):2937-48. doi: 10.1002/eji.200636759.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population level data are not available exploring the risks of subsequent cancers after breast cancer considering a familial history of breast cancers. We used the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to investigate such risks, based on 43,398 first invasive female breast cancers. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for the second cancer after breast cancer using rates for first cancer as a reference. Many cancers at discordant sites were increased after breast cancer. SIRs for subsequent neoplasms in women who had a family history of breast cancer were increased for ovarian (2.0) and endometrial (1.8) cancers and for acute lymphoid leukemia (12.7) and myelofibrosis (9.4). The data suggest that the familial aggregation of breast and endometrial cancers may be explained by yet unidentified heritable causes. The remarkably high risks for second acute lymphoid leukemia and myelofibrosis, both characterized by chromosomal aberrations, in women with a family history of breast cancer may signal heritable defects in the ability to process DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation and chemotherapy.","['Hemminki, Kari', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Lorenzo Bermejo, Justo']","['Hemminki K', 'Zhang H', 'Sundquist J', 'Lorenzo Bermejo J']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. k.hemminki@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070927,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,IM,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10549-007-9759-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2008 Sep;111(1):165-9. doi: 10.1007/s10549-007-9759-5.

In particular, it has been demonstrated that the Asn-linked glucidic residues were directly responsible for the metastatic potential, and it is known that the glycohydrolase alpha-D-mannosidase specifically hydrolyze the Asn-linked oligosaccharides. In this report, we present an in vitro study on the ATRA effects on lysosomal glycohydrolases expression and the eventual relationship with the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. We have investigated two highly expressed lysosomal glycohydrolases, namely beta-D-hexosaminidase and alpha-D-mannosidase, and showed that they were differently affected by ATRA differentiating action. In particular, due to the specific action on Asn-linked oligosaccharides, we tested alpha-D: -mannosidase enzymatic activity and observed that it was dramatically decreased after ATRA incubation, indicating a relationship with the differentiation state of the cells. These observations may directly be linked with the loss of metastatic progession of differentiated HL-60.","['Racanicchi, Leda', 'Montanucci, Pia', 'Basta, Giuseppe P P', 'Pensato, Alessandra', 'Conti, Valentina', 'Calafiore, Riccardo']","['Racanicchi L', 'Montanucci P', 'Basta GP', 'Pensato A', 'Conti V', 'Calafiore R']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Di.M.I.), Section of Internal Medicine and Endocrine and Metabolic Sciences, University of Perugia, Via E.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vectors containing the HSV-TK gene were constructed to achieve targeted gene transfer into CD4-positive ATL cells, after which the transduced cells were selectively killed by treatment with ganciclovir (GCV). To examine the utility of HIV vectors in vivo, ATL-NOD-SCID mice were prepared by intraperitoneal injection of 1 x 10(7) MT2 cells into NK-depleted nonobese diabetic/severely compromised immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. Thereafter, 1 ml of concentrated HIV vector expressing HSV-TK (HXCTKN) or GFP (HXGFP) stock was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity, and GCV was administered twice a day for 5 days. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis showed that 7-11% of MT2 or HUT102 cells recovered from the peritoneal cavity were transduced with the HXGFP. After 3 weeks, plasma sIL2-R alpha levels were significantly lower in mice administered HXCTKN than in those administered HXGFP. Moreover, HXCTKN-injected mice survived significantly longer than HXGFP-injected mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that HIV vectors could be used for in vivo targeted gene transfer into ATL cells and could thus serve as the basis for the development of effective new therapies for the treatment of ATL.","['Miyake, K', 'Inokuchi, K', 'Miyake, N', 'Dan, K', 'Shimada, T']","['Miyake K', 'Inokuchi K', 'Miyake N', 'Dan K', 'Shimada T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Gene Therapy Research Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. kmiyake@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070927,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Animal', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['3303024 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.gt.3303024 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2007 Dec;14(23):1662-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3303024.

Despite enormous insights into tumor angiogenesis in solid tumors, little is known about the time-course-dependent properties of tumor vascularization in hematologic malignancies. The aim of this study was to establish a model of myeloid leukemia, which allows long-term monitoring of tumor progression and associated microcirculation. Red fluorescent protein-transduced human leukemic cell lines (M-07e) were implanted into cranial windows of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Intravital microscopy was performed over 55 days to measure functional (microvascular permeability, tissue perfusion rate and leukocyte-endothelium interactions) and morphological vascular parameters (vessel density, distribution and diameter). Tumor progression was associated with elevated microvascular permeability and an initial angiogenic wave followed by decreased vessel density combined with reduced tissue perfusion due to loss in small vessels and development of heterogenous tumor vascularization. Following altered geometric resistance of microcirculation, leukocyte-endothelium interactions were more frequent without increased leukocyte extravasation. It was concluded that time-dependent alterations of leukemic tumor vascularization exhibit strong similarities to those found in solid tumors.

We particularly focus on promising data from our group, characterizing a new mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb A24) against the human transferrin receptor (TfR-1). Monoclonal antibodies to target cell differentiation markers on ATLL cells have already been proposed as therapeutic agents. However, in clinical trials acute forms of ATLL were resistant to these immunotherapies. A24 binds TfR-1 (K(d) 2.7 nM) and competes with transferrin for receptor binding. It blocks the proliferation of malignant cells (TfR-1(high)), such as HTLV-I-infected T cells but not of resting cells. A24 induces TfR-1 endocytosis in lysosomal compartments where the receptor is degraded leading to intracellular iron deprivation. In HTLV-I-infected cells, A24 targets and induces apoptosis of both chronic and acute ATLL forms, independent of antibody aggregation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or complement addition. The antibody efficacy was confirmed in animal models.

Although front therapy induces a high rate of complete remission (CR), relapse is inevitable and new regimens are much needed for relapsed MCL.

Here we evaluated whether BTZ is additive or synergistic with cyclophosphamide (CTX) and rituximab (RTX). Increasing doses of BTZ with a fixed dose of RTX and CTX (BRC regimen) resulted in markedly synergistic growth inhibition of MCL cells. BRC significantly enhanced apoptosis in MCL cell lines and primary tumor cells compared with single-agent treatment. Furthermore, western blotting analysis indicated that BRC induces apoptosis earlier via activation and cleavage of caspases-8, -9 and -3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, than single-agent treatment. The pan-caspase inhibitor completely blocked apoptosis induced by BRC. In vivo studies showed that BRC eradicated subcutaneous tumors in MCL-bearing SCID mice and significantly prolonged the long-term event-free survival in 70% of the mice. Hence, our study demonstrates that cytoreductive chemotherapy with both BTZ and anti-CD20 antibody may offer a better therapeutic modality for relapsed MCL.","['Wang, M', 'Han, X H', 'Zhang, L', 'Yang, J', 'Qian, J F', 'Shi, Y K', 'Kwak, L W', 'Romaguera, J', 'Yi, Q']","['Wang M', 'Han XH', 'Zhang L', 'Yang J', 'Qian JF', 'Shi YK', 'Kwak LW', 'Romaguera J', 'Yi Q']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas M.

To identify the genes dysregulated by the aberrant transcriptional activity of RUNX1-RUNX1T1, we used microarrays to determine the effect of this mutation on gene expression in human progenitor cells and during subsequent development. Gene signatures of these developmental subsets were very dissimilar indicating that effects of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 are highly context dependent. We focused on gene changes associated with the granulocytic lineage and identified a clinically relevant subset of these by comparison with 235 leukaemia patient transcriptional signatures. We confirmed the overexpression of a number of significant genes (Sox4, IL-17BR, CD200 and gamma-catenin). Further, we show that overexpression of CD200 and gamma-catenin is also associated with the inv(16) abnormality which like RUNX1-RUNX1T1 disrupts core binding factor activity.

Amikacin is used for treating hospital-acquired infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides. The blood levels, however, have to be monitored carefully because of its ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Methotrexate (MTX) is used as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma as well as of certain solid tumors. Current enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) assays for caffeine, amikacin, and MTX lack low-end precision. In addition, the EMIT assays for MTX lack the sensitivity of reliable quantification to 0.05 micromol/L needed because of today's more rigorous requirements. The goal of the present study was to optimize the EMIT method parameters on the Dimension RxL Max, thereby providing applications with improved precision for all the three analytes and enhancing the sensitivity of the EMIT methotrexate assay. Serum samples were measured for caffeine, amikacin, and MTX by EMIT on the Dimension RxL Max and by EMIT (on the Olympus AU 600 for caffeine) and fluorescence polarization immunoassay [for MTX and amikacin (FPIA; TDx FLx)] at Quest Diagnostics. The new instrument method parameters that use larger sample volumes and longer observation of optical density changes (caffeine, MTX) provide improved sensitivity for MTX permitting reliable measurement at 0.05 micromol/L and improved precision for all three analytes. Within- and between-day imprecision were less than 6% for low to high concentrations of caffeine and amikacin controls and are less than 7.5% for MTX concentrations greater than 0.3 micromol/L and 12.3% at 0.06 micromol/L. The correlation coefficients for caffeine, amikacin, and MTX plotted for the Dimension RxL Max versus the methods used at Quest Diagnostics were 0.973, 0.986, and 0.992, respectively. These EMIT method applications now compare well with other established assays. The new Dimension RxL Max method parameters provide greatly improved precision and also meet today's clinical sensitivity guidelines (0.05 micromol/L) for MTX.","['Mendu, Damodara Rao', 'Chou, Peter P', 'Soldin, Steven J']","['Mendu DR', 'Chou PP', 'Soldin SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Georgetown University and Georgetown Clinical Research Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amikacin/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Caffeine/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/09/28 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181570791 [doi]', '00007691-200710000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2007 Oct;29(5):632-7. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181570791.,,,,,['M01-RR13297/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven of the 14 patients entered complete remission; 9 are still alive. Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained by blood sampling at appropriate intervals on days 1 to 4. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol concentrations in plasma and in peripheral leukemic blast cells were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Following liposomal daunorubicin administration, the peak values and plasma area under the curve (AUC) were more than 100 times higher than after administration of conventional daunorubicin (AUC, 176 vs. 0.98 micromol/L x hour), but the intracellular AUCs were comparable (759 vs. 715 micromol/L x hour). Intracellular concentrations after DaunoXome peaked later and half as high as after daunorubicin. After DaunoXome versus daunorubicin, plasma clearance was 0.001 versus 0.4 micromol/h, respectively. The volume of distribution was 5.5 L for DaunoXome, versus 3640 L for daunorubicin, indicating low tissue affinity for the liposomal formulation.

Here, we investigate the downstream events and signaling pathways regulated by Dgkalpha, leading to cell scatter and migration upon HGF treatment and v-Src expression in epithelial cells. We report that specific inhibition of Dgkalpha, obtained either pharmacologically by R59949 treatment, or by expression of Dgkalpha dominant-negative mutant, or by small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous Dgkalpha, impairs 1) HGF- and v-Src-induced cell scatter and migration, without affecting the loss of intercellular adhesions; 2) HGF-induced cell spreading, lamellipodia formation, membrane ruffling, and focal adhesions remodeling; and 3) HGF-induced Rac activation and membrane targeting.

In addition to the SRF binding site (CArG box), serum response elements (SRE) also typically contain a binding site for a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF) family. Here we demonstrate the presence of two TCF binding sites upstream of the viral CArG box. Binding of the TCF family member Elk-1 to these sites was shown to activate transcription of the promoter. Based on these results, the position of the previously described viral SRE (vSRE) within the HTLV-1 promoter can be extended from -116 to -157 to include the two newly identified TCF sites. Purified Elk-1 bound to a probe containing the vSRE, and this complex formed a ternary complex with SRF. In addition, the complex formed by nuclear extract on this probe contained Elk-1, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay supershift. Both of the predicted TCF sites independently bound Elk-1. Elk-1 activated transcription of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and mutations within either of the TCF sites or the CArG box reduced responsiveness of the LTR to Elk-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Elk-1 associates with the HTLV-1 LTR in vivo. These results identify a functional SRE within the HTLV-1 LTR and suggest that both Elk-1 and SRF play important roles in regulating basal HTLV-1 gene expression.","['Winter, Heather Y', 'Dayaram, Tajhal', 'Marriott, Susan J']","['Winter HY', 'Dayaram T', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, MS-385, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20070926,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1/*metabolism']",2007/09/28 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00968-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00968-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Dec;81(23):13075-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00968-07.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed and pooled the results of cohort studies published through February 2007. RESULTS: There were 5651 deaths from all cancers observed in six cohorts of industry workers and six of professionals, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 0.95 for industry workers and of 0.87 for professionals. Nine deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer in three cohorts of industry workers yielded a pooled RR of 1.33, which declined to 0.49 after excluding six cases from one US plant. The pooled RR for lung cancer was 1.06 in industry workers and 0.63 in professionals. Corresponding values were 1.09 and 0.96 for oral and pharyngeal, 0.92 and 1.56 for brain, 0.85 and 1.31 for all lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers, and 0.90 and 1.39 for leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive review of cancer in industry workers and professionals exposed to formaldehyde shows no appreciable excess risk for oral and pharyngeal, sinonasal or lung cancers. A non-significantly increased RR for nasopharyngeal cancer among industry workers is attributable to a cluster of deaths in a single plant. For brain cancer and lymphohematopoietic neoplasms there were modestly elevated risks in professionals, but not industry workers.","['Bosetti, C', 'McLaughlin, J K', 'Tarone, R E', 'Pira, E', 'La Vecchia, C']","['Bosetti C', 'McLaughlin JK', 'Tarone RE', 'Pira E', 'La Vecchia C']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20070925,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupations/statistics & numerical data', 'Otorhinolaryngologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Rats', 'Risk', 'Species Specificity', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41090-9 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdm202 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Jan;19(1):29-43. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdm202.

The viral oncoprotein Tax has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Recently, cell-free Tax was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients, implying that extracellular Tax may be relevant to neurologic disease. Additionally, the presence of a nuclear export signal within Tax and its active secretion has been demonstrated in vitro. However, the mechanism of Tax secretion remains to be established. Studies reported herein elucidate the process of Tax secretion and identify domains of Tax critical to its subcellular localization and secretion. Tax was shown to interact with a number of cellular secretory pathway proteins in both the model cell line BHK (baby hamster kidney)-21 and an HTLV-1-infected T cell line, C8166, physiologically relevant to HTLV-1-induced disease. Silencing of selected components of the secretory pathway affected Tax secretion, further confirming regulated secretion of Tax. Additionally, mutations in two putative secretory signals within Tax DHE and YTNI resulted in aberrant subcellular localization of Tax and significantly altered protein secretion. Together, these studies demonstrate that Tax secretion is a regulated event facilitated by its interactions with proteins of the cellular secretory pathway and the presence of secretory signals within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein.","['Jain, Pooja', 'Mostoller, Kate', 'Flaig, Katherine E', 'Ahuja, Jaya', 'Lepoutre, Veronique', 'Alefantis, Timothy', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Jain P', 'Mostoller K', 'Flaig KE', 'Ahuja J', 'Lepoutre V', 'Alefantis T', 'Khan ZK', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Virology and Neuroimmunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, 2900 Queen Lane, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070926,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Products, tax/cerebrospinal fluid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/cerebrospinal fluid/genetics/virology', 'Nuclear Export Signals/*physiology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/cerebrospinal fluid/genetics/virology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Protein Transport/physiology']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/01/24 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)54510-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M707317200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Nov 23;282(47):34581-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M707317200.

The analysis of growth factors indicated that both hEGF and hFGF2 were required for proliferation of fNPCs. In contrast to the effect on human NPCs, human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) enhanced differentiation of fNPCs. Expanded fNPCs were injected into the brains of normal adult cats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the majority of transplanted cells were located adjacent to the injection site and some fNPCs differentiated into neurons. The survival of transplanted fNPCs over time was monitored using non-invasive bioluminescent imaging technology.

In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), PAX5 is involved in several chromosome translocations that fuse the N-terminal paired DNA-binding domain of PAX5 with the C-terminal regulatory sequences of ETV6, FOXP1, ZNF521 or ELN. Herein, we describe the identification of a novel recurrent t(9;15)(p13;q24) in two cases of childhood ALL, which results in an in-frame fusion of PAX5 to the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene. The putative PAX5-PML fusion gene encodes a chimaeric protein that retains the paired domain, the octapeptid and the partial homeodomain of PAX5, and virtually the whole PML protein. The steadily increasing number of PAX5 rearrangements suggests that PAX5 is not only crucial for B-cell lymphopoiesis but also for the development of B-cell malignancies.","['Nebral, Karin', 'Konig, Margit', 'Harder, Lana', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Nebral K', 'Konig M', 'Harder L', 'Siebert R', 'Haas OA', 'Strehl S']","[""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6731 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06731.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Oct;139(2):269-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06731.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted an international, web-based survey of patients with CLL using standardized instruments with published population norms to evaluate fatigue and QOL. Co-morbid health conditions were assessed using the Charlson Co-Morbidity Index. Between June and October 2006, 1482 patients with CLL responded to the survey. The physical, social/family, functional, and overall QOL scores of CLL patients were similar to or better than published population norms. In contrast, the emotional well-being scores of CLL patients were dramatically lower than that of both the general population (P < 0.001) and patients with other types of cancer (P < 0.001). QOL scores were lower among individuals with advanced stage disease (all P < 0.05). Factors associated with lower overall QOL on multivariate analysis included older age, greater fatigue, severity of co-morbid health conditions, and current treatment. CLL has a profound impact on QOL at all disease stages. The effects of CLL on QOL appear to differ from that of other malignancies with a more marked impact on emotional QOL.

Bortezomib induced apoptosis of primary AML blasts: 18/30 AMLs were clearly sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of Bortezomib, while the remaining cases were moderately sensitive to this molecule. The addition of tumour necrosis factor-related-apoptosis-inducing ligand, when used alone, did not induce apoptosis of AML blasts and further potentiated the cytotoxic effects of Bortezomib. The majority of AMLs sensitive to Bortezomib showed immunophenotypic features of the M4 and M5 French-American-British classification subtypes and displayed myelomonocytic features. All AMLs with mutated FLT3 were in the Bortezomib-sensitive group. Biochemical studies showed that: (i) Bortezomib activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 and decreased cellular FLICE [Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme]-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) levels in AML blasts; (ii) high c-FLIP levels in AML blasts were associated with low Bortezomib sensitivity. Finally, analysis of the effects of Bortezomib on leukaemic cells displaying high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity suggested that this drug induced in vitro killing of leukaemic stem cells. The findings of the present study, further support the development of Bortezomib as an anti-leukaemic drug and provide simple tools to predict the sensitivity of AML cells to this drug.","['Riccioni, Roberta', 'Senese, Mara', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Riti, Viviana', 'Buffolino, Sonia', 'Mariani, Gualtiero', 'Boe, Alessandra', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Foa, Robin', 'Peschle, Cesare', 'Testa, Ugo']","['Riccioni R', 'Senese M', 'Diverio D', 'Riti V', 'Buffolino S', 'Mariani G', 'Boe A', 'Cedrone M', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Foa R', 'Peschle C', 'Testa U']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Boronic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/analysis/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/analysis/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/analysis', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/analysis', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/analysis/metabolism']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6757 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06757.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Oct;139(2):194-205. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06757.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five cytoplasmic adaptors, MyD88, Mal, Trif, TRAM and SARM, are utilized by the TLRs to activate these signalling pathways. Through the years the main focus of research has been on the activation and function of TLRs in monocytic cells. This review discusses several additional roles of TLRs. TLR activation plays a role in influencing the differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells. Their activation also prevents apoptosis in neutrophils following pathogen invasion.

To optimize outcome clinicians must be able to predict which patients are at highest risk of anesthetic complications. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 118 pediatric patients who presented with mediastinal masses. We investigated their medical records for clinical symptoms and signs at presentation and reviewed their chest radiographs, computed tomography scans, and echocardiograms and electrocardiograms when available. We then conducted analyses to identify clinical and diagnostic imaging features associated with anesthesia-related complications. RESULTS: Eleven of 117 [9.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1-14.7%] patients experienced an anesthesia-related complication. Four preoperative features were significantly associated with anesthetic complications: orthopnea (P = 0.033, odds ratio (OR) 5.31, 95% CI, 1.15-24.56), upper body edema (P = 0.035, OR 8.00, 95% CI, 1.16-55.07), great vessel compression (P = 0.037, OR 5.41, 95% CI, 1.11-26.49), and main-stem bronchus compression (P = 0.044, OR 5.11, 95% CI, 1.05-24.92). The presence of pleural effusion (P = 0.060, OR 4.53, 95% CI, 0.94-21.96) or tracheal compression (P = 0.061, OR 5.09, 95% CI, 0.93-27.81) also appeared to be risk factors. Although the rate of anesthesia-related complications detected in our cohort was comparable with that found in earlier studies, the events were less severe. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who present with orthopnea, upper body edema, great vessel compression and main stem bronchus compression are at risk of anesthesia-related complications. The low severity of complications in our series may reflect a combination of factors: use of the least invasive method such as interventional radiology to obtain tissue for diagnosis, completion of a thorough preoperative assessment and minimal anesthesia intervention.","['Anghelescu, Doralina L', 'Burgoyne, Laura L', 'Liu, Tiebin', 'Li, Chin-Shang', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Furman, Wayne L', 'Sandlund, John T']","['Anghelescu DL', 'Burgoyne LL', 'Liu T', 'Li CS', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Furman WL', 'Sandlund JT']","[""Division of Anesthesiology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. doralina.anghelescu@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,France,Paediatr Anaesth,Paediatric anaesthesia,9206575,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anesthesia/*adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intraoperative Complications/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*complications/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Medical Records', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/01/26 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['PAN2279 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1460-9592.2007.02279.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Anaesth. 2007 Nov;17(11):1090-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9592.2007.02279.x.,,,PMC4400730,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS676129'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transition-state theory has led to the design of 9-deazanucleotide analogues that are purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) inhibitors, termed immucillins. Among them the most promising results have been obtained with forodesine. Forodesine (BCX-1777, Immucillin H, 1-(9-deazahypoxanthin)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol) has carbon-carbon linkage between a cyclic amine moiety that replaces ribose and 9-deaza-hypixanthine. The drug is a novel T-cell selective immunosuppressive agent which in the presence of 2'-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) inhibits human lymphocyte proliferation activated by various agents such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), mixed lymphocyte reaction and phytohemagglutinin. In the mechanism of forodesine action two enzymes are involved: PNP and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). PNP catalyzes the phosphorolysis of dGuo to guanine (Gu) and 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate, whereas dCK converts dGuo to deoxyguanosino-5'-monophosphate (dGMP) and finally to deoxyguanosino-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). The affinity of dGuo is higher for PNP than for dCK. Nevertheless, if PNP is blocked by forodesine, plasma dGuo is not cleaved to Gu, but instead it is intracellularly converted to dGTP by high dCK activity, which leads to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), an enzyme required for DNA synthesis and cell replication, which eventually results in apoptosis. Forodesine is active in some experimental tumors in mice, however it could be used for the treatment of human T-cell proliferative disorders and it is undergoing phase II clinical trials for the treatment of T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which includes cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Moreover, recent preclinical and clinical data showed activity of forodesine in B-cell acute lympholastic leukemia (ALL).","['Korycka, Anna', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Korycka A', 'Blonski JZ', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Ciolkowskiego 2, 93-510 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Purine Nucleosides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2007/09/28 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138955707781662636 [doi]'],ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2007 Sep;7(9):976-83. doi: 10.2174/138955707781662636.,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mounting evidence suggests that these cells are responsible for re-growth of a tumor following unsuccessful treatment and for the establishment of metastases. The concept of CSC has been demonstrated in several human cancers including leukemia, breast, prostate, lung, and brain tumors. Taken together, the properties of CSC suggest that they are appropriate targets for cancer therapies. Such treatments would require a deep understanding of the CSC origin, molecular profile, and interaction with the local microenvironment.

This review will present data supporting each of the current pathophysiologic pathways implicated in the development and progression of MDS; summarize the emerging clinical paradigms for treating patients with MDS; and offer insights into several novel approaches attempting to improve treatment options for future MDS patients.","['Warlick, E D', 'Smith, B D']","['Warlick ED', 'Smith BD']","['Hematologic Malignancies Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans Street, room 246 Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. edahl2@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*physiopathology/*therapy']",2007/09/28 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156800907781662284 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2007 Sep;7(6):541-58. doi: 10.2174/156800907781662284.,,219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past decade, many of the pathways leading to apoptosis, as well as the molecular mechanisms blocking the death of tumor cells, have been elucidated. This detailed knowledge of the core apoptosis machinery is now being exploited for translation into novel cancer therapies in order to restore apoptosis induction in tumor cells. Strategies include activation of proapoptotic mediators such as death receptors, tumor protein p53, and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)/DIABLO as well as inhibition of endogenous apoptosis inhibitors such as IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) and BCL-2 (B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma) proteins. Several approaches employing gene therapy and antisense strategies, recombinant biologics, or classic organic and combinatorial chemistry, have advanced into clinical trials or are already approved.

METHODS: In a single-center longitudinal study, serial body mass indices (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) measurements of children ages 2-20 at time of ALL diagnosis and enrolled on pediatric cooperative group trials from 1993-2003 were abstracted from medical records and converted to population-referenced z-scores. RESULTS: Among 165 study participants, BMI z-scores increased significantly between diagnosis (median age 4.8 years) and therapy completion. At the end of therapy, 17.0% of survivors were overweight (BMI of 25-29, or 85-94% for age), 21.2% were obese (BMI >or=30, or >or=95% for age), and 15.3% had BP meeting stage 1+ hypertension thresholds (systolic or diastolic BP >or=140/90 mm Hg, or 95% for age and height plus 5 mm Hg). These proportions were found to be unchanged 2-3 years later. In multivariate analysis, the highest level of corticosteroid exposure was associated with both obesity (odds ratio [OR] 6.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2-28.5) as well as stage 1+ hypertension (OR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-5.1) compared with the lowest level. Females also were more likely to have increased BMI and elevated BP compared with males. Treatment intensity and cranial radiotherapy were not found to be associated with BMI or BP changes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite reductions in the use of cranial radiotherapy, contemporary childhood survivors of ALL remain at an increased risk of obesity and hypertension at least several years after the completion of treatment, with those exposed to higher doses of corticosteroids at greater risk.","['Chow, Eric J', 'Pihoker, Catherine', 'Hunt, Kathryn', 'Wilkinson, Karen', 'Friedman, Debra L']","['Chow EJ', 'Pihoker C', 'Hunt K', 'Wilkinson K', 'Friedman DL']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. ericchow@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*complications', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",2007/09/28 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/09/28 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23050 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Nov 15;110(10):2313-20. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23050.,,,,,['T32-CA009351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the use of various treatment regimens, the prognosis of ATL is poor, and new treatment strategies are urgently needed. We therefore explored the effect and the molecular mechanism of a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, in ATL cells. We found bortezomib-induced cell death, and bortezomib suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activation via I-kappaB stabilisation in three ATL cell lines (TaY, MT-2 and MT-4). An oligonucleotide DNA microarray analysis of TaY cells revealed upregulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPA1A, STIP1, HSPA1B, and HSPCA), genes related to protein folding (CDC37 and ANAPC5), Fas-associated factor 1(FAF1) and an oxidative stress-related gene, heme oxygenase-1(HMOX-1), known to be a target gene of hypoxia-inducible gene-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). Cobalt protoporphyrin induced HMOX-1, instead of HIF-1 alpha expression and increased bortezomib-induced apoptosis in the presence of pharmacologically effective doses of bortezomib. In contrast, zinc protoporphyrin downregulated HMOX-1 expression, thereby partially inhibiting bortezomib-induced cell death. This indicates that HMOX-1 may modulate anticancer effects of bortezomib in ATL cells, and could be a molecular target in treating ATL patients.","['Hamamura, R S', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Kurashina, R', 'Kobayashi, C', 'Zhang, Y', 'Takaku, T', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Hamamura RS', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Kurashina R', 'Kobayashi C', 'Zhang Y', 'Takaku T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070925,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '63AAN3JDZE (cobaltiprotoporphyrin)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/09/27 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/09/27 09:00'],"['2007/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['6604003 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604003 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2007 Oct 22;97(8):1099-105. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604003.

We recently identified these structures in pancreatic islet cells. The objectives of this study are to describe the light microscopic features and cellular pattern of distribution of INRs in human pancreatic islet cells. METHODS: Double immunofluorescence staining was performed on 5 human pancreatic tissue samples for the detection of class III beta tubulin (C3T) to detect INRs and for promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein to examine the relationship between PML and INRs. RESULTS: Intranuclear rodlets were detected in 22.99% of pancreatic B cells compared with only 3.11%, 1.80%, and 1.60% of A, D, and PP cells, respectively. Twenty-four percent of C3T-immunoreactive INRs showed partial or complete immunoreactivity for PML. Promyelocytic leukemia staining within the nuclei of B cells was confined to INRs and was not present in the typical PML bodies present in other cell types. Spatially, PML and C3T staining of islet cell INRs appeared to be mutually exclusive within individual INRs. CONCLUSIONS: Intranuclear rodlets are present within the nuclei of pancreatic islet cells, where they reside predominantly but not exclusively in B cells. Immunoreactivity of B-cell INRs for PML suggests that the functional significance of INRs may be related to that of PML and/or PML bodies. Conversely, the exclusive localization of PML staining to INRs in B cells indicates that PML's function in B cells is selectively associated with INRs. The mutually exclusive pattern of PML and C3T staining suggests dynamic interactions between these 2 proteins in B-cell INRs. In light of evidence for the involvement of INRs and of PML bodies in disease, it will be of interest to investigate these structures in animal models of diabetes and in human diabetes.","['Prichett, Wendy', 'Milman, Pavel', 'Gagnon, Jeff', 'Munoz, David G', 'Woulfe, John']","['Prichett W', 'Milman P', 'Gagnon J', 'Munoz DG', 'Woulfe J']","['Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, The Ottawa Health Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pancreas,Pancreas,8608542,['0 (Tubulin)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*ultrastructure', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Glucagon-Secreting Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*ultrastructure', 'Islets of Langerhans/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*ultrastructure', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide-Secreting Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Somatostatin-Secreting Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Tubulin/analysis']",2007/09/27 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/09/27 09:00'],"['2007/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPA.0b013e318067fee1 [doi]', '00006676-200710000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Pancreas. 2007 Oct;35(3):207-11. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0b013e318067fee1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rarely, classic Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is observed. Published small series suggest that tumor cells in DLBCL and HL can be clonally identical to the B-CLL clone or arise as an independent, secondary lymphoma. We describe the morphology, immunophenotype, and clinical features of 34 classic RT patients with DLBCL, 6 cases of B-CLL with HL, and 8 cases with scattered CD30-positive Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)-like cells. The clonal relationship of the 2 components was analyzed using sequencing analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) genes. In classic RT, 18/23 B-CLL cases (78%) showed clonal progression to DLBCL with identical IgVH sequences in both lymphoma components, whereas in 5 cases (22%) the DLBCL was clonally unrelated. Among clonally related RT samples, 73% carried unmutated IgVH genes, whereas 4/5 unrelated cases were mutated. Immunophenotypically, most cases of DLBCL irrespective of clonal relatedness showed significant differences in phenotype compared with the B-CLL, with common loss of CD5 and CD23. Using immuno-laser capture microdissection, sequencing of the IgVH CDR3 region of isolated HRS cells showed that 2/2 cases with HL were clonally unrelated, whereas they were clonally identical in 1/2 cases of B-CLL with scattered HRS-like cells. HRS or HRS-like cells in all 3 unrelated cases showed evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection.

MDS-CA development was linked to lower CD34 yield at collection, longer time interval from MM diagnosis to HDT, older age, and lower platelet recovery after HDT; persistent MDS-CAs were predicted by CD34 yield of less than 3 x 10(6)/kg and need for more than 2 apheresis procedures. Applying a tertile frequency distribution over time to all 105 patients with MDS-CAs, its detection early after HDT was associated with longer time interval from diagnosis and low pre-HDT platelet count (likely resulting from pre-HDT damage), whereas late-onset MDS-CAs were noted among patients treated with Total Therapy 2 and Total Therapy 3 that applied post-HDT consolidation chemotherapy (suggesting possible post-HDT damage).

They originate from bone marrow (BM) progenitors, which are frequently the targets of chromosomal translocations leading to development of leukemia. Aberrant DC differentiation and functions have been observed and are widely reported in patients with leukemia. It is not clear, however, whether such defects are a direct effect of a leukemic fusion gene or simply an outcome of the clinical disease. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that knockin of the Mll-Een fusion gene can affect myeloid DC differentiation and functions directly, independent of the leukemic disease activities. We showed that the Mll-Een-expressing BM cells [enhanced green fluorescent protein+ (EGFP+)] from leukemic and nonleukemic mice had similarly impaired DC differentiation capacities with functional abnormalities. In contrast, BM cells without Mll-Een expression (EGFP(-)) showed normal DC differentiation and functions. A reduction in the frequency of CD11c+ DCs was also observed within the EGFP+ population in spleen and lymph nodes, and these cells were dysfunctional. Taken together, our findings suggest that the Mll-Een fusion gene can affect myeloid DC differentiation directly and functions in a cell-autonomous manner, where fully leukemic transformation of the hematopoietic progenitors is not required exclusively. Therefore, the study provides evidence for a direct causal relationship between leukemic gene fusion and abnormal DC differentiation, possibly contributing to the development of leukemia.","['Sun, Q', 'Kong, C T', 'Huang, F P', 'Chan, L C']","['Sun Q', 'Kong CT', 'Huang FP', 'Chan LC']","['Department of Pathology, S.

We examined the individual roles that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), two intracellular cAMP receptors, play in this synergistic effect. Our studies demonstrate that PKA is responsible for the observed synergism with GC, whereas Epac exerts a weak antagonistic effect against GC-induced apoptosis. We find that endogenous PKA activity is higher in the GC-sensitive clone than in the GC-resistant clone. In the GC-sensitive clone, higher PKA activity is associated with lower Hedgehog (Hh) activity. Moreover, inhibition of Hh activity by Hh pathway-specific inhibitors leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CEM (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T lineage) cells, and the GC-sensitive clone is more sensitive to Hh inhibition. These results suggest that Hh activity is critical for leukemia cell growth and survival and that the level of Hh activity is in part responsible for the synergism between cAMP and GC.","['Ji, Zhenyu', 'Mei, Fang C', 'Johnson, Betty H', 'Thompson, E Brad', 'Cheng, Xiaodong']","['Ji Z', 'Mei FC', 'Johnson BH', 'Thompson EB', 'Cheng X']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070925,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (RAPGEF3 protein, human)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2007/09/27 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/09/27 09:00'],"['2007/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)77690-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M703697200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Dec 28;282(52):37370-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M703697200.

In this study we compared monocyte derived human DC from conventional cultures containing GM-CSF and IL-4/TNF-alpha (IL-4/TNF-DC) with DC generated by the novel protocol using GM-CSF and IFN-alpha (IFN-DC). METHODS: To characterise the molecular differences of both DC preparations, gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix microarrays. The data were conformed on a protein level by immunophenotyping, and functional tests for T cell stimulation, migration and cytolytic activity were performed. RESULTS: Both methods resulted in CD11c+ CD86+ HLA-DR+ cells with a typical DC morphology that could efficiently stimulate T cells. But gene expression profiling revealed two distinct DC populations. Whereas IL-4/TNF-DC showed a higher expression of genes envolved in phagocytosis IFN-DC had higher RNA levels for markers of DC maturity and migration to the lymph nodes like DCLAMP, CCR7 and CD49d. This different orientation of both DC populations was confined by a 2.3 fold greater migration in transwell experiments (p = 0.01). Most interestingly, IFN-DC also showed higher RNA levels for markers of NK cells such as TRAIL, granzymes, KLRs and other NK cell receptors. On a protein level, intracytoplasmatic TRAIL and granzyme B were observed in 90% of IFN-DC. This translated into a cytolytic activity against K562 cells with a median specific lysis of 26% at high effector cell numbers as determined by propidium iodide uptake, whereas IL-4/TNF-DC did not induce any tumor cell lysis (p = 0.006). Thus, IFN-DC combined characteristics of mature DC and natural killer cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that IFN-DC not only stimulate adaptive but also mediate innate antitumor immune responses. Therefore, IFN-DC should be evaluated in clinical vaccination trials. In particular, this could be relevant for patients with diseases responsive to a treatment with IFN-alpha such as Non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Korthals, Mark', 'Safaian, Nancy', 'Kronenwett, Ralf', 'Maihofer, Dagmar', 'Schott, Matthias', 'Papewalis, Claudia', 'Diaz Blanco, Elena', 'Winter, Meike', 'Czibere, Akos', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Fenk, Roland']","['Korthals M', 'Safaian N', 'Kronenwett R', 'Maihofer D', 'Schott M', 'Papewalis C', 'Diaz Blanco E', 'Winter M', 'Czibere A', 'Haas R', 'Kobbe G', 'Fenk R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany. mark.korthals@gmx.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070925,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2007/09/27 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2007/09/27 09:00'],"['2007/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-5876-5-46 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-5-46 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2007 Sep 25;5:46. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-5-46.,,,PMC2064912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicenter, single-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT to determine the effect of the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration on bleeding risk. Patients with acute leukemia receiving induction chemotherapy or those undergoing stem cell transplantation were assigned to one of two treatment groups: standard transfusion strategy (transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells [RBCs] when their Hb level was less than 80 g/L) or an augmented transfusion strategy (transfusion of 2 units of RBCs when their Hb level was less than 120 g/L). RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled: 29 in the control group and 31 in the experimental group. The proportions of patients experiencing clinically significant bleeding and the time to first bleed were not significantly different between the control and experimental groups. The experimental group received more RBC transfusions (transfusions/patient-day) than the control group (0.233 vs. 0.151; relative risk, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.10; p = 0.003). The proportion of patient-days with platelet (PLT) transfusions was not different between the experimental and control groups. The mean number of donor exposures (PLT and RBC transfusions) was not different between experimental and control groups. Bleeding symptoms were systematically documented.

Leukotrienes are released from activated mast cells via an IgE-dependent mechanism, and play a crucial role in ocular allergic inflammation. In this study, the effect of three topical antiglaucoma drugs, that is, latanoprost, timolol and GLC756, a novel dopamine D(2) agonist and D(1) antagonist, on leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) release after rat mast cell activation was examined. METHODS: A rat basophilic leukaemia RBL-2H3 mast cell line was activated via IgE/anti-IgE. Rat mast cells were incubated with latanoprost, timolol, or GLC756 at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 and 30 microM. LTC(4) concentration in supernatant was assessed 5 h post activation by EIA. RESULTS: Compared with controls, timolol showed no relevant effect on LTC(4) release, 5 h after mast cell activation. Latanoprost and GLC756, in contrast, revealed an inhibitory effect on LTC(4) release, which was dose-related and statistically significant at the concentrations of 10 and 30 microM. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that timolol has no significant influence on LTC(4) release from activated mast cells. By contrast, latanoprost and GLC756 inhibited LTC(4) release, suggesting a possible anti-inflammatory effect on ocular allergic inflammatory processes in topical glaucoma medication.","['Laengle, Ulrich W', 'Markstein, Rudolf', 'Pralet, Dominique', 'Seewald, Wolfgang', 'Roman, Danielle']","['Laengle UW', 'Markstein R', 'Pralet D', 'Seewald W', 'Roman D']","['Department of Toxicology/Pathology, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Clinical & experimental ophthalmology,100896531,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Dopamine Agents)', '0 (Prostaglandins F, Synthetic)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Dopamine D1)', '0 (Receptors, Dopamine D2)', '0 (SDZ GLC 756)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '6Z5B6HVF6O (Latanoprost)', '817W3C6175 (Timolol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dopamine Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Latanoprost', 'Leukotriene C4/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Prostaglandins F, Synthetic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Dopamine D1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Dopamine D2/agonists', 'Timolol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2007/09/27 09:00,2007/12/20 09:00,['2007/09/27 09:00'],"['2007/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEO1560 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1442-9071.2007.01560.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2007 Sep-Oct;35(7):645-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-9071.2007.01560.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a reporter assay with the CEBPA promoter, we observed a dominant negative effect of RUNX1/EVI1 over C/EBPalpha-mediated transcriptional activation via the carboxyl terminal-binding protein (CtBP)-binding site in the EVI1 portion. In a gel-shift assay, RUNX1/EVI1 downregulated the DNA-binding activity of C/EBPalpha. Therefore, recruitment of histone deacetylase via CtBP and disruption of DNA binding could be likely scenarios for the RUNX1/EVI1-induced dominant repression on C/EBPalpha. Importantly, coexpression of C/EBPalpha restored the differentiation ability of the RUNX1/EVI1-expressing LG-3 cells. All of these data argue that inhibition of C/EBPalpha function may be causatively related to the leukemogenic potential of RUNX1/EVI1.","['Tokita, Katsuya', 'Maki, Kazuhiro', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Tokita K', 'Maki K', 'Mitani K']","['Department of Hematology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, 880 Kitakobayashi, Mibu-machi, Shimotsuga-gun, Tochigi 321-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/09/27 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/09/27 09:00'],"['2007/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS597 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00597.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Nov;98(11):1752-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00597.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this sense, a growing body of evidences supports the role of c-Abl as a major determinant of p38 MAPK activation, especially in response to genotoxic stress when triggered by cisplatin. Here, we demonstrate that p38 MAPK activation in response to cisplatin does not require the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Abl. Indeed, c-Abl can activate the p38 MAPK signaling pathway by a mechanism that is independent of its tyrosine kinase activity, but that instead involves the ability of c-Abl to increase the stability of MKK6. Similar results were obtained in chronic myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines, in which a chimeric Bcr/Abl protein mimics the effects of c-Abl overexpression on p38 MAPK activation. These findings may explain why a clinically used c-Abl inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, fails to inhibit the p38 MAPK pathway alone or in combination with cisplatin, and provide evidence of a novel signaling mechanism in which these antitumor agents act.","['Galan-Moya, Eva M', 'Hernandez-Losa, Javier', 'Aceves Luquero, Clara I', 'de la Cruz-Morcillo, Miguel A', 'Ramirez-Castillejo, Carmen', 'Callejas-Valera, Juan L', 'Arriaga, Angel', 'Aranburo, Antonio Fernandez', 'Ramon y Cajal, Santiago', 'Silvio Gutkind, J', 'Sanchez-Prieto, Ricardo']","['Galan-Moya EM', 'Hernandez-Losa J', 'Aceves Luquero CI', 'de la Cruz-Morcillo MA', 'Ramirez-Castillejo C', 'Callejas-Valera JL', 'Arriaga A', 'Aranburo AF', 'Ramon y Cajal S', 'Silvio Gutkind J', 'Sanchez-Prieto R']","['CRIB/Facultad de medicina, UCLM, 02006 Albacete, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K6 protein, human)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 6/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2007/09/26 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23063 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jan 15;122(2):289-97. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23063.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its main medicinal use is recognized as digestive, in vaccine formulation, antitumoral and skin debrider for the treatment of burns. To verify the identity of the principle in stem fractions responsible for the antitumoral effect, we isolated bromelain to probe its pharmacological effects. The isolated bromelain was obtained from stems of adult pineapple plants by buffered aqueous extraction and cationic chromatography. The homogeneity of bromelain was confirmed by reverse phase HPLC, SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing. The in vivo antitumoral/antileukemic activity was evaluated using the following panel of tumor lines: P-388 leukemia, sarcoma (S-37), Ehrlich ascitic tumor (EAT), Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), MB-F10 melanoma and ADC-755 mammary adenocarcinoma. Intraperitoneal administration of bromelain (1, 12.5, 25 mg/kg), began 24 h after tumor cell inoculation in experiments in which 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 20 mg/kg) was used as positive control. The antitumoral activity was assessed by the survival increase (% survival index) following various treatments. With the exception of MB-F10 melanoma, all other tumor-bearing animals had a significantly increased survival index after bromelain treatment. The largest increase ( approximately 318 %) was attained in mice bearing EAT ascites and receiving 12.5 mg/kg of bromelain. This antitumoral effect was superior to that of 5-FU, whose survival index was approximately 263 %, relative to the untreated control. Bromelain significantly reduced the number of lung metastasis induced by LLC transplantation, as observed with 5-FU. The antitumoral activity of bromelain against S-37 and EAT, which are tumor models sensitive to immune system mediators, and the unchanged tumor progression in the metastatic model suggests that the antimetastatic action results from a mechanism independent of the primary antitumoral effect.","['Baez, Roxana', 'Lopes, Miriam T', 'Salas, Carlos E', 'Hernandez, Martha']","['Baez R', 'Lopes MT', 'Salas CE', 'Hernandez M']","['Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Ciego de Avila, Cuba.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070924,Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '9001-00-7 (Bromelains)', 'EC 3.4.22.32 (stem bromelain)']",IM,"['*Ananas', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bromelains/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Stems']",2007/09/26 09:00,2008/01/01 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-990221 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2007 Oct;73(13):1377-83. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-990221.

In this study, we engineered noncleavable mutants of human CD154 with point mutations to develop a potentially less toxic molecule in vivo. In contrast to wild-type CD154 (CD154-WT) subsequently released as sCD154, both mutants CD154-M3 and CD154-M4 were resistant to cleavage in tumor cells. Also, CD40-expressing leukemia B cells transfected with CD154-M3 mutant were highly effective stimulators in a mixed lymphocyte-leukemia reaction, indicating that CD154-M3 mutant did not lose biologic activity. In mice transplanted with tumors expressing CD154-WT, we found increased plasma levels of human sCD154 followed by various systemic inflammatory reactions such as glomerulonephritis and an increased number of infiltrating mononuclear cells in the liver.

The molecular mechanism responsible for the anticancer effects of noscapine is poorly understood. In the current study, the apoptotic effects of noscapine on two myeloid cell lines, apoptosis-proficient HL60 cells and apoptosis-resistant K562 cells, were analyzed. An increase in the activity of caspase-2, -3, -6, -8 and -9, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage, detection of phosphatidylserine on the outer layer of the cell membrane, nucleation of chromatin, and DNA fragmentation suggested the induction of apoptosis. Noscapine increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio with a significant decrease of Bcl-2 expression accompanied with Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Using an inhibitory approach, the activation of the caspase cascade involved in the noscapine-induced apoptosis was analyzed. We observed no inhibitory effect of the caspase-8 inhibitor on caspase-9 activity. In view of these results and taking into consideration that K562 cells are Fas-null, we suggested that caspase-8 is activated in a Fas-independent manner downstream of caspase-9. In conclusion, noscapine can induce apoptosis in both apoptosis-proficient and apoptosis-resistant leukemic cells, and it can be a novel candidate in the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Heidari, Nastaran', 'Goliaei, Bahram', 'Moghaddam, Parvaneh Rahimi', 'Rahbar-Roshandel, Nahid', 'Mahmoudian, Massoud']","['Heidari N', 'Goliaei B', 'Moghaddam PR', 'Rahbar-Roshandel N', 'Mahmoudian M']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (IBB), University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antitussive Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '8V32U4AOQU (Noscapine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antitussive Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Noscapine/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology']",2007/09/26 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282eea257 [doi]', '00001813-200711000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2007 Nov;18(10):1139-47. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282eea257.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples were collected from all of the patients and control subjects. DNA was extracted by salting out method and HLA typing was performed using PCR-SSP method. Significant positive association with AML was obtained for HLA-DRB1*11allele (35% vs. 24.7%, P=0.033). Two alleles including HLA-DRB4 and -DQB1*0303 were significantly less frequent in AML patients than in controls. HLA-DQB1*0303 allele was never observed in CML patients compared with allele frequency in controls (4.2%).

However, how the Nef-Hck interaction leads to the functional aberration of macrophages is poorly understood. We recently showed that Nef markedly inhibited the activity of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), a primary cytokine for macrophages. Here, we show that the inhibitory effect of Nef is due to the Hck-dependent down-regulation of the cell surface expression of M-CSF receptor Fms. In the presence of Hck, Nef induced the accumulation of an immature under-N-glycosylated Fms at the Golgi, thereby down-regulating Fms. The activation of Hck by the direct interaction with Nef was indispensable for the down-regulation. Unexpectedly, the accumulation of the active Hck at the Golgi where Nef prelocalized was likely to be another critical determinant of the function of Nef, because the expression of the constitutive-active forms of Hck alone did not fully down-regulate Fms. These results suggest that Nef perturbs the intracellular maturation and the trafficking of nascent Fms, through a unique mechanism that required both the activation of Hck and the aberrant spatial regulation of the active Hck.","['Hiyoshi, Masateru', 'Suzu, Shinya', 'Yoshidomi, Yuka', 'Hassan, Ranya', 'Harada, Hideki', 'Sakashita, Naomi', 'Akari, Hirofumi', 'Motoyoshi, Kazuo', 'Okada, Seiji']","['Hiyoshi M', 'Suzu S', 'Yoshidomi Y', 'Hassan R', 'Harada H', 'Sakashita N', 'Akari H', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Okada S']","['Division of Hematopoiesis, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Honjo 2-2-1, Kumamoto-city, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070924,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (nef protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Protein Transport/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/09/26 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48563-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-086017 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):243-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-086017.

Activation of caspase-9 by dimerization in apoptosomes then triggers a caspase signaling cascade. In addition, other apoptosis signaling molecules released from the mitochondrion, such as apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G, may induce caspase-9-independent apoptosis. To determine the signaling events induced by caspase-9, we used chemically induced dimerization for specific activation of caspase-9. We observed that caspase-9 dimerization resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the cleavage of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Moreover, cleavage-resistant Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 potently inhibited caspase-9-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c.

D-Penicillamine (D-pen), a copper-chelating agent, at low concentrations in the presence of copper generates concentration-dependent cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The purpose of these studies was to investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and the reduction in intracellular thiol levels due to H(2)O(2) and other ROS generated from copper-catalyzed D-pen oxidation in human breast cancer cells (BT474, MCF-7) and human leukemia cells (HL-60, HL-60/VCR, HL-60/ADR). D-pen (< or = 400 microM) in the presence of cupric sulfate (10 microM) resulted in concentration-dependent cytotoxicity. Catalase was able to completely protect the cells, substantiating the involvement of H(2)O(2) in cancer cell cytotoxicity. A linear correlation between the D-pen concentration and the intracellular ROS generated was shown in both breast cancer and leukemia cells. D-pen in the presence of copper also resulted in a reduction in intracellular reduced thiol levels. The H(2)O(2)-mediated cytotoxicity was greater in leukemia cells compared to breast cancer cells. These results support the hypothesis that D-pen can be employed as a cytotoxic copper-chelating agent based on its ROS-generating ability.","['Gupte, Anshul', 'Mumper, Russell J']","['Gupte A', 'Mumper RJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536-0082, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070713,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)', 'LRX7AJ16DT (Copper Sulfate)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Copper Sulfate/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Penicillamine/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism']",2007/09/26 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(07)00465-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2007 Nov 1;43(9):1271-8. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.07.003.

The mechanism of action has been partially elucidated for TRIM5alpha, which seems to promote premature decapsidation of the restricted retroviruses. In addition, through its N-terminal RING domain, TRIM5alpha may sensitize retroviruses to proteasome-mediated degradation. TRIM5alpha-mediated restriction requires a physical interaction with the capsid protein of targeted retroviruses. It is unclear whether other cellular proteins are involved in the inhibition mediated by TRIM5alpha and TRIMCyp. A previous report suggested that the inhibition of HIV-1 by the rhesus macaque orthologue of TRIM5alpha was inefficient in the D17a canine cell line, suggesting that the cellular environment was important for the restriction mechanism. Here we investigated further the behavior of TRIM5alpha and TRIMCyp in the D17 cells. RESULTS: We found that the various TRIM5alpha orthologues studied (human, rhesus macaque, African green monkey) as well as TRIMCyp had poor antiviral activity in the D17 cells, despite seemingly normal expression levels and subcellular distribution. Restriction of both HIV-1 and the distantly related N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) was low in D17 cells. Both TRIM5alpharh and TRIMCyp promoted early HIV-1 decapsidation in murine cells, but weak levels of restriction in D17 cells correlated with the absence of accelerated decapsidation in these cells and also correlated with normal levels of cDNA synthesis. Fv1, a murine restriction factor structurally unrelated to TRIM5alpha, was fully functional in D17 cells, showing that the loss of activity was specific to TRIM5alpha/TRIMCyp. CONCLUSION: We show that D17 cells provide a poor environment for the inhibition of retroviral replication by proteins of the TRIM5 family. Because both TRIM5alpha and TRIMCyp are poorly active in these cells, despite having quite different viral target recognition domains, we conclude that a step either upstream or downstream of target recognition is impaired. We speculate that an unknown factor required for TRIM5alpha and TRIMCyp activity is missing or inadequately expressed in D17 cells.","['Berube, Julie', 'Bouchard, Amelie', 'Berthoux, Lionel']","['Berube J', 'Bouchard A', 'Berthoux L']","['Laboratory of Retrovirology, GRBCM, University of Quebec, Trois-Rivieres, QC G9A 5H7, Canada. julie.berube1@uqtr.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070924,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophilin A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2007/09/26 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-4-68 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-68 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Sep 24;4:68. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-68.,,,PMC2064933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of miRNAs (miRs) -143 and -145, the levels of which were previously shown to be reduced in colon cancers and various kinds of established cancer cell lines, was also decreased in most of the B-cell malignancies examined, including chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), B-cell lymphomas, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell lines, and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. All samples from 13 CLL patients and eight of nine B-cell lymphoma ones tested exhibited an extremely low expression of miRs-143 and -145. The expression levels of miRs-143 and -145 were consistently low in human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and were inversely associated with the cell proliferation observed in the EBV-transformed B-cell lines. Moreover, the introduction of either precursor or mature miR-143 and -145 into Raji cells resulted in a significant growth inhibition that occurred in a dose-dependent manner and the target gene of miRNA-143 was determined to be ERK5, as previously reported in human colon cancer DLD-1 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that miRs-143 and -145 may be useful as biomarkers that differentiate B-cell malignant cells from normal cells and contribute to carcinogenesis in B-cell malignancies by a newly defined mechanism.","['Akao, Yukihiro', 'Nakagawa, Yoshihito', 'Kitade, Yukio', 'Kinoshita, Tomohiro', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Akao Y', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Kitade Y', 'Kinoshita T', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, 1-1 Naka-Fudogaoka, Kakamigahara, Gifu 504-0838, Japan. yakao@giib.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070924,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Decitabine', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/09/26 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS618 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00618.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Dec;98(12):1914-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00618.x.

Little is known about DC levels in the bone marrow (BM) of patients receiving cytostatic treatment. We investigated DC levels by flow cytometry in BM at diagnosis, during and post-treatment in 76 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The levels of both plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and myeloid DC (mDC) were profoundly reduced at diagnosis. However, the levels of pDC and mDC were significantly higher in T-precursor ALL patients when compared with B-precursor ALL patient group (P = 0.044 and 0.041 respectively). Both subsets normalized in both standard-risk (SR) and high-risk patients after the end of induction at day 50. Patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 50 had significantly higher pDC levels than MRD-negative patients (P = 0.021).

This study was undertaken to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of insulin in the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI) and evaluate its therapeutic effects in adult rats. SCI was produced by extradural compression using modified Allen's stall with damage energy of 40 g-cm force. One group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of recombinant human insulin dissolved in 50% glucose solution at the dose of 1 IU/kg day, for 7 days. At the same time, another group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of an equal volume of sterile saline solution. Functional recovery was evaluated using open-field walking, inclined plane tests, and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during the first 14 days post-trauma. Levels of protein for B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene (Bcl-2), Caspase-3, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were quantified in the injured spinal cord by Western blot analysis. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Ultimately, the data established the effectiveness of insulin treatment in improving neurologic recovery, increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 proteins, inhibiting caspase-3 expression decreasing neuronal apoptosis, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines iNOS and COX-2, and ameliorating microcirculation of injured spinal cord after moderate contusive SCI in rats. In sum, this study reported the beneficial effects of insulin in the treatment of SCI, with the suggestion that insulin should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent.","['Wu, Xing-Huo', 'Yang, Shu-Hua', 'Duan, De-Yu', 'Cheng, Heng-Hui', 'Bao, Yu-Ting', 'Zhang, Yukun']","['Wu XH', 'Yang SH', 'Duan DY', 'Cheng HH', 'Bao YT', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Neurotrauma,Journal of neurotrauma,8811626,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Insulin/*therapeutic use', 'Laser-Doppler Flowmetry', 'Male', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Recovery of Function/*drug effects', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*drug therapy/pathology']",2007/09/26 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/neu.2006.0228 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurotrauma. 2007 Sep;24(9):1502-12. doi: 10.1089/neu.2006.0228.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both affect folate metabolism and thus remethylation of homocysteine, but are also thought to affect nucleotide synthesis and DNA methylation. Methotrexate (MTX), which interrupts folate metabolism, is used in the treatment of a variety of diseases including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but exerts in some patients toxic effects on fast dividing tissues such as mucosal epithelia. The enhanced toxicity may be due to cooperative effects between MTX and MTHFR variants. Accordingly, it has been reported that carrying the 677T allele of the MTHFR is a risk factor for MTX-associated mucositis. As in the Mexican population, which is characterized by a high prevalence of the 677T MTHFR variant, several of its commonly associated defects have not been observed, we investigated the relationship between MTX toxicity and the 677T allele. Out of 28 patients with ALL (CC: 2, CT: 10, TT: 16), 16 had episodes of MTX-associated mucositis (CC: 0, CT: 6, TT: 10). Neither at the gene level nor at the genotype level was a significant association with mucositis found. It may be postulated that the risk of higher MTX toxicity in patients with decreased MTHFR activity could be neutralized by the normally folate rich diet in Mexico.","['Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J', 'Coconi-Linares, Lucia Nancy', 'Garces-Eisele, Javier', 'Reyes-Nunez, Virginia']","['Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Coconi-Linares LN', 'Garces-Eisele J', 'Reyes-Nunez V']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna, Clinica Ruiz de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. gruiz1@clinicaruiz.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Mucositis/chemically induced/epidemiology/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2007/09/25 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['782270287 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701448479 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Oct;12(5):387-91. doi: 10.1080/10245330701448479.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If not addressed, distress can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and possible benefits of a music imagery intervention for patients hospitalized in a protective environment for the treatment of acute leukemia or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults receiving intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy in a protective environment were randomized to standard care or standard care plus music imagery. The music imagery sessions occurred twice weekly for up to eight sessions. Patients were encouraged to use the music imagery daily. RESULTS: The principal criteria of feasibility were rate of consent, rate of completion of scheduled sessions, and rate of questionnaire completion. Forty-nine out of 78 patients consented, a 63% consent rate. Seventy-two percent of all scheduled music imagery sessions were completed. The rate of questionnaire completion was 60% with missing data because of illness severity and early discharge. The principal outcomes of benefit (e.g., efficacy) were positive and negative affects, fatigue, and anxiety. Both groups improved over time on all outcomes (all p < 0.001). However, a subgroup of individuals with low baseline negative affect who received the intervention reported significantly less anxiety at discharge than individuals with low baseline negative affect who did not receive the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Music imagery is feasible for adults with acute leukemia in protected environments. Patients with lower initial distress may benefit from a music imagery program in terms of reduced anxiety at discharge.","['Burns, Debra S', 'Azzouz, Faouzi', 'Sledge, Renata', 'Rutledge, Cheryl', 'Hincher, Katie', 'Monahan, Patrick O', 'Cripe, Larry D']","['Burns DS', 'Azzouz F', 'Sledge R', 'Rutledge C', 'Hincher K', 'Monahan PO', 'Cripe LD']","['Indiana University School of Music, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. desburns@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070922,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/*psychology', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', '*Imagery, Psychotherapy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Music Therapy', 'Relaxation Therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-007-0330-z [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2008 May;16(5):507-13. doi: 10.1007/s00520-007-0330-z.

This tumour cell death may or may not elicit an immune response. At least in some cases, the efficacy of chemotherapy critically depends on the induction of immunogenic cell death that is a type of cell demise that stimulates the activation of an adaptative anti-tumour immune response, which in turn helps to eradicate residual cancer (stem) cells. Indeed, anthracyclins care more efficient in curing tumours in immunocompetent than in T cell-deficient mice. The molecular mechanism implicated in this anti-tumour T cell activation was recently discovered. Anthracyclins cause immunogenic cell death due to their specific capacity to stimulate the translocation of calreticulin to the cell surface. Calreticulin then acts as an ""eat me"" signal for dendritic cells, allowing them to phagocytose tumour cells and to prime tumour antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. Importantly, non-immunogenic chemotherapy can be rendered immunogenic by adsorbing recombinant calreticulin to tumour cells or by enforcing the translocation of endogenous calreticulin to the cell surface by means of PP1/GADD34 inhibitors. This strategy could have major implications for the treatment of human cancer. Indeed, in vivo treatments with anthracyclins can cause the translocation of calreticulin to the surface of circulating tumour cells, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The challenge will be to determine whether the exposure of calreticulin translocation on the tumour cell surface is linked to chemotherapy-induced anti-tumour immune responses and therapeutic efficacy in human cancer.","['Chaput, Nathalie', 'De Botton, Stephane', 'Obeid, Michel', 'Apetoh, Lionel', 'Ghiringhelli, Francois', 'Panaretakis, Theocharis', 'Flament, Caroline', 'Zitvogel, Laurence', 'Kroemer, Guido']","['Chaput N', 'De Botton S', 'Obeid M', 'Apetoh L', 'Ghiringhelli F', 'Panaretakis T', 'Flament C', 'Zitvogel L', 'Kroemer G']","[""Centre d'Investigation Clinique Biotherapie, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20070522,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calreticulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Calreticulin/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/02/12 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00109-007-0214-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2007 Oct;85(10):1069-76. doi: 10.1007/s00109-007-0214-1.

However, we have found that inhibitors of Hsp90 diminished the apoptotic response induced in leukemic cells by the antitumor alkyl-lysophospholipid analog edelfosine, which acts through lipid raft reorganization. Edelfosine treatment recruited Hsp90, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and apoptotic molecules in lipid rafts, but not the JNK regulators apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and Daxx, or the survival signaling molecules extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt. Following edelfosine treatment, Hsp90 bound to JNK in lipid rafts and Hsp90-JNK clusters were identified at the plasma membrane by immunoelectron microscopy. Hsp90 inhibition reduced JNK protein level in lipid rafts and turned proapoptotic persistent JNK activation into a transient response in edelfosine-treated cells. Decrease in edelfosine-induced JNK activation and apoptosis by Hsp90 inhibition was prevented through proteasome inhibition, suggesting that Hsp90 inhibition diminishes apoptosis by promoting JNK protein degradation. Expression of ASK1 dominant negative mutant did not affect JNK activation and apoptosis following edelfosine treatment. These data indicate that lipid raft-recruited JNK is ASK1-independent and becomes a novel Hsp90 client protein. Our results reveal a new chaperoning role of Hsp90 on JNK-mediated apoptosis following its recruitment in lipid rafts.","['Nieto-Miguel, T', 'Gajate, C', 'Gonzalez-Camacho, F', 'Mollinedo, F']","['Nieto-Miguel T', 'Gajate C', 'Gonzalez-Camacho F', 'Mollinedo F']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (C.S.I.C.)-Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070924,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210816 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210816 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Mar 13;27(12):1779-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210816.

ITF2357 0.1 microM blocked proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells, while AML1/ETO-negative HL60, THP1 and NB4 cell lines were sensitive only to 1 microM ITF2357. Apoptosis was induced by 0.1 microM ITF2357 in AML1/ETO-positive primary blasts and U937-A/E cells induced to express AML1/ETO, but not in U937-A/E cells non-expressing AML1/ETO. In Kasumi-1 cells 0.1 microM ITF2357 induced AML1/ETO degradation through a caspase-dependent mechanism. ITF2357 0.1 microM also determined DNMT1 efflux from, and p300 influx to, the nucleus. Moreover, 0.1 microM ITF2357 determined local H4 acetylation and release of DNMT1, HDAC1 and AML1/ETO, paralleled by recruitment of p300 to the IL-3 gene promoter. ITF2357 treatment, however, did not induce re-expression of IL-3 gene. Accordingly, the methylation level of IL-3 promoter, as well as of several other genes, was unmodified. In conclusion, ITF2357 emerged as an anti-leukaemic agent very potent on AML cells, and on AML1/ETO-positive cells in particular. More relevantly, clearly emerged from our results that ITF2357 could be an ideal agent to treat AML subtypes presenting AML1/ETO fusion protein which determine HDAC involvement in leukaemogenesis.","['Barbetti, V', 'Gozzini, A', 'Rovida, E', 'Morandi, A', 'Spinelli, E', 'Fossati, G', 'Mascagni, P', 'Lubbert, M', 'Dello Sbarba, P', 'Santini, V']","['Barbetti V', 'Gozzini A', 'Rovida E', 'Morandi A', 'Spinelli E', 'Fossati G', 'Mascagni P', 'Lubbert M', 'Dello Sbarba P', 'Santini V']","['Dipartimento di Patologia e Oncologia Sperimentali, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070924,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'Z02132R2QQ (givinostat hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210820 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210820 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Mar 13;27(12):1767-78. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210820.

Although the methylation of arginine 3 of histone 4 (H4R3) by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is a critical modification for active chromatin and prevention of heterochromatin spread, there has been no direct evidence of any role of PRMTs in cancer. Here, we show that PRMT1 is an essential component of a novel Mixed Lineage Leukaemia (MLL) oncogenic transcriptional complex with both histone acetylation and H4R3 methylation activities, which also correlate with the expression of critical MLL downstream targets. Direct fusion of MLL with PRMT1 or Sam68, a bridging molecule in the complex for PRMT1 interaction, could enhance self-renewal of primary haematopoietic cells. Conversely, specific knockdown of PRMT1 or Sam68 expression suppressed MLL-mediated transformation. This study not only functionally dissects the oncogenic transcriptional machinery associated with an MLL fusion complex, but also uncovers--for the first time--an essential function of PRMTs in oncogenesis and reveals their potential as novel therapeutic targets in human cancer.","['Cheung, Ngai', 'Chan, Li Chong', 'Thompson, Alex', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'So, Chi Wai Eric']","['Cheung N', 'Chan LC', 'Thompson A', 'Cleary ML', 'So CW']","['Haemato-Oncology Section, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Greater London SM2 5NG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070923,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KHDRBS1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncb1642 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb1642 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2007 Oct;9(10):1208-15. doi: 10.1038/ncb1642.

G(2) arrest is regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint and by survival signaling, with a potential role of PI3K/Akt in checkpoint function. In this work, we wanted to clarify if inhibition of multiple checkpoint/survival pathways may confer better efficacy in the potentiation of genotoxic agents compared to inhibition of either pathway alone. We compared the influence of UCN-01, which affects both the DNA damage checkpoint and PI3K/Akt-mediated survival signaling, with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 in p53-deficient M1 acute myeloid leukemia cells treated with the DNA damaging agent cisplatin. Our results show that direct inhibition of PI3K/Akt in G(2)-arrested cells by wortmannin or LY294002 strongly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin without influencing the G(2) checkpoint. Unexpectedly, dual inhibition of both survival and checkpoint signaling by UCN-01, also increased the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, but to a lesser degree than wortmannin or LY294002. The differences in cytotoxicity were accompanied by differences in cell death pathways: direct inhibition of PI3K/Akt was accompanied by rapid apoptotic cell death during G(2), whereas cells underwent mitotic transit and cell division followed by cell death during G(1) when both checkpoint and survival signaling were inhibited. Our results elucidate a novel function for PI3K/Akt as a survival factor during DNA damage-induced G(2) arrest and could have important pharmacological consequences for the application of response modulators in p53-deficient tumors with strong survival signaling.","['Skladanowski, Andrzej', 'Bozko, Przemyslaw', 'Sabisz, Michal', 'Larsen, Annette K']","['Skladanowski A', 'Bozko P', 'Sabisz M', 'Larsen AK']","['Group of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, INSERM U673 and Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070705,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics']",2007/09/25 09:00,2007/11/13 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['4705 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.6.18.4705 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Sep 15;6(18):2268-75. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.18.4705.

This study investigates the effect of levonorgestrel and mifepristone on attachment of human embryos to an in vitro endometrial construct. METHOD: Three-dimensional endometrial constructs were established by co-culturing early luteal phase human endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. Expression of endometrial receptivity markers in this construct were examined by immunohistochemistry. Effects of mifepristone and levonorgestrel on viability and attachment of human blastocysts were investigated. RESULTS: Endometrial constructs expressed the factors involved in endometrial receptivity: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-1, COX-2, MUC-1 and integrin-alpha(V)beta(3). None of the 15 embryos cultured with mifepristone attached to the endometrial construct (P < 0.01), whereas 10/17 in control, and 6/14 in levonorgestrel, groups attached. The attachment was confirmed by the positive expression of cytokeratin 7 at the attachment site. CONCLUSION: Mifepristone inhibits blastocyst attachment. Levonorgestrel did not impair the attachment of human embryos to the in vitro endometrial construct.

We investigated signaling pathways used by OxLDL to attenuate apoptosis in monocytic cells. OxLDL at 25-50 mug/ml inhibited staurosporine-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages, and it was cytoprotective in human primary monocytes upon serum withdrawal. Attenuated cell demise was reversed by blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Translocation of cytochrome c to the cytosol was attenuated by OxLDL, which again demanded ERK signaling. Analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins revealed phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 as well as ERK-dependent inhibition of Mcl-1 degradation. Although the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an established signal generated by OxLDL, ROS scavengers did not interfere with cell protection by OxLDL. Thus, activation of the ERK signaling pathway by OxLDL is important to protect phagocytes from apoptosis.","['Namgaladze, Dmitry', 'Kollas, Andreas', 'Brune, Bernhard']","['Namgaladze D', 'Kollas A', 'Brune B']","['Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry I, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070921,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/03/08 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2275(20)42880-9 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.M700100-JLR200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2008 Jan;49(1):58-65. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M700100-JLR200.

A robust technology, single nucleotide polymorphism oligonucleotide genomic microarray (SNP-chip) in concert with bioinformatics offers the opportunity to discover the genetic lesions associated with ALL. We examined 399 pediatric ALL samples and their matched remission marrows at 50,000/250,000 SNP sites using an SNP-chip platform. Correlations between genetic abnormalities and clinical features were examined. Three common genetic alterations were found: deletion of ETV6, deletion of p16INK4A, and hyperdiploidy, as well as a number of novel recurrent genetic alterations. Uniparental disomy (UPD) was a frequent event, especially affecting chromosome 9. A cohort of children with hyperdiploid ALL without gain of chromosomes 17 and 18 had a poor prognosis. Molecular allelokaryotyping is a robust tool to define small genetic abnormalities including UPD, which is usually overlooked by standard methods. This technique was able to detect subgroups with a poor prognosis based on their genetic status.","['Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Yamatomo, Go', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Koehler, Rolf', 'Flohr, Thomas', 'Miller, Carl W', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Kawamata N', 'Ogawa S', 'Zimmermann M', 'Kato M', 'Sanada M', 'Hemminki K', 'Yamatomo G', 'Nannya Y', 'Koehler R', 'Flohr T', 'Miller CW', 'Harbott J', 'Ludwig WD', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M', 'Bartram CR', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center/University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine 90048, USA. kawamatan@cshs.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ploidies', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48496-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-088310 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 15;111(2):776-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-088310.

Indeed, CCR7 (the CCL21 receptor), as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), are overexpressed in infiltrating B-CLL cells. We have studied whether MMP-9 is regulated by CCL21 and participates in CCL21-dependent migration. CCL21 significantly increased B-CLL MMP-9 production, measured by gelatin zymography. This was inhibited by blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activity or by cell transfection with CCR7-siRNA. Accordingly, CCL21/CCR7 interaction activated the ERK1/2/c-Fos pathway and increased MMP-9 mRNA. CCL21-driven B-CLL cell migration through Matrigel or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was blocked by anti-CCR7 antibodies, CCR7-siRNA transfection, or the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126, as well as by anti-MMP-9 antibodies or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). These results strongly suggest that MMP-9 is involved in B-CLL nodal infiltration and expand the roles of MMP-9 and CCR7 in B-CLL progression. Both molecules could thus constitute therapeutic targets for this disease.","['Redondo-Munoz, Javier', 'Jose Terol, Maria', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Redondo-Munoz J', 'Jose Terol M', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Departamento de Fisiopatologia Celular y Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCL21 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Movement/physiology', 'Chemokine CCL21/*metabolism', 'Collagen', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Humans', 'Laminin', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Proteoglycans', 'Receptors, CCR7/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48581-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-107300 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):383-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-107300.

In vitro, TCL1 can modulate the activity of the serine-threonine kinase AKT, a downstream effector of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. In a series of 86 T-PLL tumors, we show that expression of TCR, and levels of TCL1 and activated AKT are adverse prognostic markers. High-level TCL1 in TCR-expressing T-PLL is associated with higher presenting white blood cell counts, faster tumor cell doubling, and enhanced in vitro growth response to TCR engagement. In primary tumors and TCL1-transfected T-cell lines, TCR engagement leads to rapid recruitment of TCL1 and AKT to transient membrane activation complexes that include TCR-associated tyrosine kinases, including LCK. Pharmacologic inhibition of AKT activation alters the localization, stability, and levels of these transient TCL1-AKT complexes and reduces tumor cell growth. Experimental introduction and knockdown of TCL1 influence the kinetics and strength of TCR-mediated AKT activation. We propose that in T-PLL, TCL1 represents a highly regulated, targetable modulator of TCR-mediated AKT growth signaling.","['Herling, Marco', 'Patel, Kaushali A', 'Teitell, Michael A', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kobayashi, Ryuji', 'Jones, Dan']","['Herling M', 'Patel KA', 'Teitell MA', 'Konopleva M', 'Ravandi F', 'Kobayashi R', 'Jones D']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.

Within the immune system, Stat5 plays important roles related to the development of thymocytes and proliferation of T cells. Stat5 has been implicated in malignant transformation, and moreover, the activated tyrosine phosphorylated form of Stat5 is frequently observed in human lymphomas. We previously demonstrated the oncogenic potential of Stat5, with thymic lymphoblastic lymphomas developing in a significant proportion of transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing Stat5a or Stat5b in lymphocytes. In addition, immunization or expression of a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgene augmented the rate of tumor formation. Here, we investigate the mechanism of Stat5-mediated lymphomagenesis by exploring the contributions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/TCR and pre-TCR signals. We present data demonstrating that Stat5b TG mice unexpectedly develop CD8(+) lymphoma even in the absence of either pre-TCR signaling or normal thymic selection. Indeed, acceleration of Stat5b transgene-mediated lymphoma occurred on TCRalpha(-/-) and pre-TCRalpha(-/-) backgrounds. In light of these data, we propose a model in which alterations in T-cell development at the double-negative/double-positive (DN/DP) stages cooperate with cytokine-mediated pathways in immature thymocytes to give rise to lymphoblastic T-cell lymphomas in Stat5b TG mice.","['Bessette, Katherine', 'Lang, Mark L', 'Fava, Roy A', 'Grundy, Martin', 'Heinen, Jennifer', 'Horne, Laurie', 'Spolski, Rosanne', 'Al-Shami, Amin', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Leonard, Warren J', 'Kelly, John A']","['Bessette K', 'Lang ML', 'Fava RA', 'Grundy M', 'Heinen J', 'Horne L', 'Spolski R', 'Al-Shami A', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Leonard WJ', 'Kelly JA']","[""White River Junction Veteran's Association, White River Junction, VT, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20070921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology/physiology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Transgenes/physiology']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48575-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-084707 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):344-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-084707.

In the leukaemias, post-translational modification of proteins (e.g. phosphorylation, acetylation) plays a key role in the molecular pathology of the disease: such modifications can now be detected with novel proteomic methods. In a clinical setting, serum remains a relatively un-mined source of information for prognosis and response to therapy.

Naturally occurring hypoallergens have by and large not been considered as a source of vaccine candidates. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the antibody response in atopic individuals induced by birch pollen containing isoforms of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. METHODS: Isoform-specific antibody isotype responses for Bet v 1.0101, Bet v 1.0401, and Bet v 1.1001 were determined for 35 sera of individuals with birch pollen allergy. Isoform structures were compared and related to IgE-binding inhibitory capacities and induction of mediator release in human Fcvarepsilon receptor transformed rat basophilic leukemia cells. RESULTS: Bet v 1.0101 induced a predominant IgE response, whereas the significant highest levels of IgG(4) antibodies were directed against Bet v 1.0401. Bet v 1.1001 induced only a minimal antibody response. Structural comparisons revealed that most of the amino acid differences between the isoforms were located on the protein surfaces.

A microfluidic perfusion system is developed here to measure the kinetic changes of cell volume under various extracellular conditions, in order to determine cell osmotic behavior and membrane transport properties. The system is fabricated using soft lithography and is comprised of microfluidic channels and a perfusion chamber for trapping cells. During experiments, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1 line) cells were injected into the inlet of the device, allowed to flow downstream, and were trapped within a perfusion chamber. The fluid continues to flow to the outlet due to suction produced by a Hamilton Syringe. Two sets of experiments have been performed: the cells were perfused by (1) hypertonic solutions with different concentrations of non-permeating solutes and (2) solutions containing a permeating cryoprotective agent (CPA), dimethylsulfoxide (Me(2)SO), plus non-permeating solute (sodium chloride (NaCl)), respectively. From experiment (1), cell osmotically inactive volume (V(b)) and the permeability coefficient of water (L(p)) for RBL cells are determined to be 41% [n=18, correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.903] of original/isotonic volume, and 0.32+/-0.05 microm/min/atm (n=8, r(2)>0.963), respectively, for room temperature (22 degrees C). From experiment (2), the permeability coefficient of water (L(p)) and of Me(2)SO (P(s)) for RBL cells are 0.38+/-0.09 microm/min/atm and (0.49+/-0.13) x 10(-3)cm/min (n=5, r(2)>0.86), respectively. We conclude that this device enables us to: (1) readily monitor the changes of extracellular conditions by perfusing single or a group of cells with prepared media; (2) confine cells (or a cell) within a monolayer chamber, which prevents imaging ambiguity, such as cells overlapping or moving out of the focus plane; (3) study individual cell osmotic response and determine cell membrane transport properties; and (4) reduce labor requirements for its disposability and ensure low manufacturing costs.","['Chen, Hsiu-Hung', 'Purtteman, Jester J P', 'Heimfeld, Shelly', 'Folch, Albert', 'Gao, Dayong']","['Chen HH', 'Purtteman JJ', 'Heimfeld S', 'Folch A', 'Gao D']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, ME Building R254, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070824,Netherlands,Cryobiology,Cryobiology,0006252,"['0 (Dimethylpolysiloxanes)', '0 (Silicones)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '63148-62-9 (baysilon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Dimethylpolysiloxanes', '*Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Osmosis', 'Rats', 'Silicones', 'Water/metabolism']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2006/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0011-2240(07)00115-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cryobiol.2007.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cryobiology. 2007 Dec;55(3):200-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cryobiol.2007.08.001.

METHODS: We have cultured acute myeloid leukemia CD34(+) cells on bone marrow stroma. Long-term expansion was monitored and self-renewal was addressed by replating of Leukemic-cobblestone area-forming cells (L-CAs). Also, lentiviral vectors were generated that could target L-CAs. RESULTS: A strong expansion was observed in about 75% of the acute myeloid leukemia cases (n = 30) and long-term cultures could be maintained for up to 24 weeks on MS5 bone marrow stromal cells. Cells that were able to initiate leukemic cobblestone areas resided in the CD34(+) population and were absent from the CD34(-) population. Self-renewal within these L-CAs was determined by sequential passaging of these L-CAs onto new MS5 stromal layers, which resulted in the generation of second, third, and fourth L-CAs, which were able to sustain long-term expansion and generated high numbers of immature undifferentiated suspension cells. CD34(+) cells that were able to initiate long-term cultures all coexpressed MEIS1 and HOXA9, and expressed elevated BMI1 levels. CONCLUSION: We present a novel long-term leukemic stem/progenitor assay in which new drugs can be tested and in which genes can be overexpressed or downmodulated using a lentiviral approach in order to obtain more insight into the process of leukemic transformation and self-renewal.","['van Gosliga, Djoke', 'Schepers, Hein', 'Rizo, Aleksandra', 'van der Kolk, Dorina', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['van Gosliga D', 'Schepers H', 'Rizo A', 'van der Kolk D', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2007/09/25 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2006/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00409-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Oct;35(10):1538-49. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small molecule-inhibitor therapy targeting the FLT3 kinase is, therefore, an attractive strategy. FLT3 kinase inhibitors, such as PKC412, have already entered clinical trials. Even though results are encouraging, emergence of primary and secondary resistance does occur in the majority of patients. Thus, it will be crucial to carefully characterize the activity of every single compound against different activating and resistance FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. Here we tested the efficacy of sunitinib and sorafenib to inhibit primary FLT3 activating mutations (ITD and D835Y) and of secondary resistance mutations. METHODS: Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing oncogenic FLT3 mutations were used to calculate cellular IC(50) values for sunitinib and sorafenib using cell proliferation assays. Differential IC(50) values for sorafenib toward FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835Y were confirmed by Western blotting. Cell death was measured by propidium-iodide staining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Sorafenib inhibits FLT3-ITD more potent than FLT3-D835Y, while sunitinib is equally effective against both mutant forms of FLT3. Importantly, sensitivity toward sorafenib and sunitinib varies between the different secondary FLT3-ITD resistance mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish sensitivity profiles for the FLT3 inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib. This may help to develop rational treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia with these compounds.","['Kancha, Rama Krishna', 'Grundler, Rebekka', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Duyster, Justus']","['Kancha RK', 'Grundler R', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory of Leukemogenesis, Technical University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diet therapy/enzymology', '*Mutation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sunitinib', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2007/09/25 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00430-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Oct;35(10):1522-6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.07.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cytogenetic, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and polymerase chain reaction methods revealed no other chromosomal change expected to occur in a disease that we assumed to be a secondary leukemia. Due to the lack of cytogenetic data from the diagnostic sample, we developed a new approach to analyze the archived bone marrow smear, which had been stained previously with May-Grunwald-Geimsa by the FISH method.

We therefore investigated the occurrence of this rare breakpoint in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs).

Ten resistant/relapsed CLL patients underwent HSC mobilization with chemotherapy and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Positive selection of circulating CD133(+) HSCs was performed by immunomagnetic technique. Highly purified HSCs were reinfused after busulphan/melphalan myeloablative treatment. A median number of 4.2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg and of 3.14 x 10(6) CD133(+) cells/kg were collected. Immunomagnetic selection resulted in the reinfusion of a median number of 2.45 x 10(6) CD133(+) cells/kg (median purity: 94.8%; median recovery: 84%) and 2.4 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg (median purity: 93%; median recovery: 71%). HSC selection resulted in a median T cell and CD19(+)/CD5(+) cell depletion of 3.85 log and 2.8 log, respectively. At the molecular level, however, 7 of 8 valuable purified HSC fractions were contaminated by leukemic cells. All CLL patients showed rapid and sustained myeloid engraftment after reinfusion of purified CD133(+) cells.

However, the factors determining early lymphocyte recovery are not defined. To further explore the relationship between lymphocyte recovery and outcome we analyzed lymphocyte counts and other engraftment parameters in 157 patients with leukemia (48 acute myelogenous leukemia, 80 chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 29 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) receiving T cell-depleted myeloablative SCT from an HLA-identical sibling. In multivariate analysis the day 30 absolute lymphocyte count (LC30) above the median of 450/muL was associated with improved survival (71% +/- 5% versus 38% +/- 6%, P < .0001), less relapse (21% +/- 5% versus 44% +/- 7%, P = .009), less nonrelapse mortality (NRM; 9 +/- 3 versus 36% +/- 6%, P < .0001) and less acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (34% +/- 5% versus 51% +/- 6%, P = .025). The beneficial effect of a higher LC30 influenced outcome in patients with both standard and high-risk disease but did not affect survival and relapse in ALL. We found that a higher LC30 correlated with higher lymphocyte counts at all time points between 30 and 90 days post-SCT and also with more rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment. These results indicate that LC30 is a surrogate for robust engraftment and identifies an ""at-risk"" population of patients after T cell-depleted SCT.","['Savani, Bipin N', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Montero, Aldemar', 'Yong, Agnes S', 'Wish, Laura', 'Superata, Jeannine', 'Kurlander, Roger', 'Singh, Anurag', 'Childs, Richard', 'Barrett, A John']","['Savani BN', 'Mielke S', 'Rezvani K', 'Montero A', 'Yong AS', 'Wish L', 'Superata J', 'Kurlander R', 'Singh A', 'Childs R', 'Barrett AJ']","['Hematology Branch, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070824,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",2007/09/25 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00335-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Oct;13(10):1216-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.07.005.

Several independent reports have shown that individuals constitutionally homozygous for MMR allelic variants develop early onset hematological malignancies often associated to features of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome. The genetic mechanism of NF1 associated to MMR gene deficiency is not fully known. We report here that a child with this form of NF1 displays a heterozygous NF1 gene mutation (c.3721C>T), in addition to a homozygous MLH1 gene mutation (c.676C>T) leading to a truncated MLH1 protein (p.R226X). The parents did not display NF1 features nor the NF1 mutation. This new NF1 gene mutation is recurrent and predicts a truncated neurofibromin (p.R1241X) lacking its GTPase activating function, as well as all C-terminally located functional domains. Our findings suggest that NF1 disease observed in individuals homozygous for deleterious MMR variants may be due to a concomitant NF1 gene mutation. The presence of both homozygous MLH1 and heterozygous NF1 mutation in the child studied here also provides a mechanistic explanation for early onset malignancies that are observed in affected individuals. It also provides a model for cooperation between genetic alterations in human carcinogenesis.","['Alotaibi, Hani', 'Ricciardone, Marie D', 'Ozturk, Mehmet']","['Alotaibi H', 'Ricciardone MD', 'Ozturk M']","['Bilkent University, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, 06800, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20070809,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Consanguinity', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Pedigree']",2007/09/25 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(07)00315-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2008 Jan 1;637(1-2):209-14. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.08.003.

Immunohistochemical staining using tumor tissue microarrays consisting of 372 archived non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens revealed positive staining of FGFR1OP in 334 (89.8%) of 372 NSCLCs. We also found that the high level of FGFR1OP expression was significantly associated with shorter tumor-specific survival times (P < 0.0001 by log-rank test). Moreover, multivariate analysis determined that FGFR1OP was an independent prognostic factor for surgically treated NSCLC patients (P < 0.0001). Treatment of lung cancer cells, in which endogenous FGFR1OP was overexpressed, using FGFR1OP siRNA, suppressed its expression and resulted in inhibition of the cell growth. Furthermore, induction of FGFR1OP increased the cellular motility and growth-promoting activity of mammalian cells. To investigate its function, we searched for FGFR1OP-interacting proteins in lung cancer cells and identified ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1) and WRNIP1 (Werner helicase interacting protein 1), which was known to be involved in cell cycle progression. FGFR1OP significantly reduced ABL1-dependent phosphorylation of WRNIP1 and resulted in the promotion of cell cycle progression. Because our data imply that FGFR1OP is likely to play a significant role in lung cancer growth and progression, FGFR1OP should be useful as a prognostic biomarker and probably as a therapeutic target for lung cancer.","['Mano, Yuria', 'Takahashi, Koji', 'Ishikawa, Nobuhisa', 'Takano, Atsushi', 'Yasui, Wataru', 'Inai, Kouki', 'Nishimura, Hitoshi', 'Tsuchiya, Eiju', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Daigo, Yataro']","['Mano Y', 'Takahashi K', 'Ishikawa N', 'Takano A', 'Yasui W', 'Inai K', 'Nishimura H', 'Tsuchiya E', 'Nakamura Y', 'Daigo Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070918,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CEP43 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/therapeutic use']",2007/09/25 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS610 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00610.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Dec;98(12):1902-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00610.x.

The infection process is modeled assuming cell-to-cell infection of CD4+ T cells. The model allows for CD4+ T cell subsets of susceptible, latently infected and actively infected cells as well as for leukemia cells.

To maintain pluripotency, ES cells are typically cultured on feeder cells of varying origins. Murine ES cells are commonly cultured on murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which senesce early and must be frequently prepared. This process is laborious and leads to batch variation presenting a challenge for high-throughput ES cell expansion. Although some cell lines can be sustained by exogenous LIF, this method is costly. We present here a novel and inexpensive culture method for expanding murine ES cells on human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) feeders. After 20 passages on HFFs without LIF, ES cell lines showed normal expression levels of pluripotency markers, maintained a normal karyotype and retained the ability to contribute to the germline. As HFFs do not senesce for at least 62 passages, they present a vast supply of feeders.","['Meng, G L', 'Zur Nieden, N I', 'Liu, S Y', 'Cormier, J T', 'Kallos, M S', 'Rancourt, D E']","['Meng GL', 'Zur Nieden NI', 'Liu SY', 'Cormier JT', 'Kallos MS', 'Rancourt DE']","['Institute of Maternal & Child Health, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foreskin/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/09/22 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2007/09/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mrd.20790 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2008 Apr;75(4):614-22. doi: 10.1002/mrd.20790.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

They continue to be effective at second- and even third-line therapy; however, alternative treatments are needed for patients who are or have become refractory to these agents or whose remissions are shorter with each course of therapy. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 8 patients who received pentostatin or cladribine combined concurrently (n = 6 patients) or sequentially (n = 2 patients) with rituximab at second-line therapy (n = 3 patients) and at subsequent lines of therapy (n = 5 patients). Results from a previously reported database of 219 patients with HCL (73 patients who received second-line therapy and 20 patients who received third-line therapy) were used as a historic control group against which to measure benefit. RESULTS: All 8 patients responded to therapy, with 7 complete responses (CRs) (87.5%) and minimal toxicity. All patients who had CRs were negative for minimal residual disease (MRD). At a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 5-39 months) 1 patient developed recurrent disease, and the estimated 2-year recurrence rate was 20% (0% after second-line therapy and 25% after subsequent lines of therapy). In the historic control group, the CR rates were 70% after second-line therapy and 45% after third-line therapy, and the recurrence rates at 2 years were 15% and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of purine analogs with rituximab was safe and effective for patients with recurrent and/or refractory HCL, and the current results suggested an added benefit compared with standard treatment.","['Else, Monica', 'Osuji, Nnenna', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Dearden, Claire', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Else M', 'Osuji N', 'Forconi F', 'Dearden C', 'Del Giudice I', 'Matutes E', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Lauria F', 'Catovsky D']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital/Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab']",2007/09/22 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/09/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23032 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Nov 15;110(10):2240-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23032.,,,,,,,['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were prestimulated with 100 pM fMLP and subsequently treated for 15 min with different electrical fields and currents. Three hours later the release of IL-8 into the medium was determined by ELISA. Varying the frequency of the sinusoidal electrical current between 0 and 20 Hz resulted in 2 maxima of IL-8 release at 5 and 13 Hz. Prestimulated cells were treated with sine-, triangular-, and rectangular-waveforms at 5 Hz in the current intensity range of 0-3 mA/cm(2). For the three waveforms tested, the IL-8 release was enhanced 1.5 fold. Treatment of the cells with capacitively coupled electric fields of 5 Hz using field strengths between 0 and 10 V(eff)/cm had no effect on the release of IL-8. In comparison to the positive results after sine wave exposure alone, an exposure with sine wave current to which noise had been superimposed had no effect on the HL-60 cells. From these investigations it can be concluded that for electrical current treatment of prestimulated HL-60 cells the release of IL-8 does not depend on the waveform if the waveform information is not destroyed by superimposed noise.","['Sontag, Werner', 'Weibezahn, Karl F']","['Sontag W', 'Weibezahn KF']","['Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institut fur Biologische Grenzflachen, Karlsruhe, Germany.

A series of resistant models were developed from CCRF-CEM leukaemia cells with increasing doses of cisplatin from 100 ng/ml. This produced increasing resistance up to 7-fold with a treatment dose of 1.6 microg/ml. Cisplatin resistance in these cells correlated with increases in the antioxidant glutathione, yet treatment with buthionine sulphoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, had no effect on resistance, suggesting that the increase in glutathione was not directly involved in cisplatin resistance. Two models were developed from H69 SCLC cells, H69-CP and H69CIS200 using 100 ng/ml or 200 ng/ml cisplatin respectively. Both cell models were 2-4 fold resistant to cisplatin, and have decreased expression of p21 which may increase the cell's ability to progress through the cell cycle in the presence of DNA damage. Both the H69-CP and H69CIS200 cells showed no decrease in cellular cisplatin accumulation. However, the H69-CP cells have increased levels of cellular glutathione and are cross resistant to radiation whereas the H69CIS200 cells have neither of these changes. This suggests that increases in glutathione may contribute to cross-resistance to other drugs and radiation, but not directly to cisplatin resistance. There are multiple resistance mechanisms induced by cisplatin treatment, even in the same cell type. How then should cisplatin-resistant cancers be treated? Cisplatin-resistant cell lines are often more sensitive to another chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (H69CIS200), or are able to be sensitized to cisplatin with paclitaxel pre-treatment (H69-CP). The understanding of this sensitization by paclitaxel using cell models of cisplatin resistance will lead to improvements in the clinical treatment of cisplatin resistant tumours.","['Stordal, Britta', 'Davey, Mary']","['Stordal B', 'Davey M']","['Bill Walsh Cancer Research Laboratories, Royal North Shore Hospital and University of Sydney, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.

Histologically, the differential diagnosis includes the 'small round cell' tumor group, particularly metastatic small cell carcinoma and blastic hematological malignancies involving skin/soft tissues. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a DNA polymerase, which is a sensitive and specific antibody for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma with a small proportion of acute myeloid leukemia showing positivity. This study investigates the expression of TdT in 20 cases with initial diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. Archival blocks and slides were retrieved and reviewed and clinical information obtained from patient charts. Immunohistochemistry was performed and graded as: 0, no staining; 1+, less than 50% staining in the cells; 2+, 50% or more staining in the cells. After review, 15 cases were confirmed as Merkel cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical positivity was as follows: 8/15 cases were positive for TdT with strong nuclear staining, morphologically resembling 'blasts', AE1AE3, CAM5.2 (15/15) (both membrane and paranuclear dot positivity), CD56 and BCL-2 (15/15), Synaptophysin (13/15), Chromogranin A (11/15), NSE (15/15), CK20 (14/15), CK7 (3/15), both CK7 and CK20 (3/15), CD117 (8/15), CD99 (2/15), CD10 (1/15). One case was negative for CK7/CK20. All 15 cases were negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, LCA, CD20, CD3 and CD34. Expanded immunohistochemical panel with positive staining for epithelial/neuroendocrine markers, CK20, negative staining for hematolymphoid markers and awareness of TdT expression and other markers that show overlap with blastic hematological malignancies avoids misinterpretation in the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. This aids in further diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, avoiding the potential diagnostic pitfall with other small round cell tumors and hematological malignancies primary or metastatic to the skin.","['Sur, Monalisa', 'AlArdati, Hosam', 'Ross, Cathy', 'Alowami, Salem']","['Sur M', 'AlArdati H', 'Ross C', 'Alowami S']","['Division of Anatomical Pathology, Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. surm@hhsc.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070921,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism']",2007/09/22 09:00,2008/01/17 09:00,['2007/09/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['3800936 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.3800936 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2007 Nov;20(11):1113-20. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800936.

Disseminated RMS can present with extensive bone marrow involvement. Assessing the extent of the tumor is critical, because therapy and prognosis depend on the degree to which the mass has spread beyond the primary site. The value of F-18 FDG PET in patients with RMS has been reported in some series but none specifically involving bone marrow. Children have a highly cellular hematopoietic bone marrow and differentiation of a highly cellular marrow from neoplastic infiltration may be difficult. Various other conditions associated with diffuse FDG uptake in the bone marrow include marrow hyperplasia resulting from hemolytic/iron-deficiency/blood-loss anemia, after chemotherapy with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant erythropoietin treatment, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myelodysplasia. It is therefore important to consider the above differential diagnoses in mind when evaluating cases of unexpected marrow uptake in F-18 FDG PET studies. We report here a case of RMS with diffuse bone marrow involvement detected on F-18 FDG PET wherein FDG PET was useful in determining the true extent (primary and metastases) of RMS before definitive therapy and the valuable adjunct role it has with structural imaging in management.","['Seshadri, Nagabushan', 'Wright, Penny', 'Balan, Kottekkattu K']","['Seshadri N', 'Wright P', 'Balan KK']","[""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Clin Nucl Med,Clinical nuclear medicine,7611109,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Female', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy']",2007/09/22 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2007/09/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/RLU.0b013e318148b434 [doi]', '00003072-200710000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Nucl Med. 2007 Oct;32(10):787-9. doi: 10.1097/RLU.0b013e318148b434.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, IA appears to be gaining a foothold in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients without classical risk factors. A recent study described 89 cases of IA in patients in a medical ICU without leukemia or cancer. The diagnosis of IA remains difficult and is often established too late. Galactomannan (GM) is an exo-antigen released from Aspergillus hyphae while they invade host tissue. OBJECTIVES: This prospective single-center study was conducted to investigate the role of GM in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as a tool for early diagnosis of IA in the ICU. METHODS: All patients with risk factors identified in our earlier study were evaluated. BAL for culture and GM detection, serum GM levels, and computed tomography scan were obtained for all included patients with signs of pneumonia. Patients were classified as having proven, probable, or possible IA. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 110 patients out of 1,109 admissions were eligible. There were 26 proven IA cases. Using a cutoff index of 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity of GM detection in BAL fluid was 88 and 87%, respectively. The sensitivity of serum GM was only 42%. In 11 of 26 proven cases, BAL culture and serum GM remained negative, whereas GM in BAL was positive. CONCLUSIONS: IA is common in immunocompromised, critically ill patients. GM detection in BAL fluid seems to be useful in establishing or excluding the diagnosis of IA in the ICU.","['Meersseman, Wouter', 'Lagrou, Katrien', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Wilmer, Alexander', 'Hermans, Greet', 'Vanderschueren, Steven', 'Spriet, Isabel', 'Verbeken, Eric', 'Van Wijngaerden, Eric']","['Meersseman W', 'Lagrou K', 'Maertens J', 'Wilmer A', 'Hermans G', 'Vanderschueren S', 'Spriet I', 'Verbeken E', 'Van Wijngaerden E']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital Leuven, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium. wouter.meersseman@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070920,United States,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,9421642,"['0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/*microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*microbiology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cause of Death', 'Cross Infection/diagnosis/microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Lung/microbiology/pathology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/diagnosis/*microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mannans/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycological Typing Techniques', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated/diagnosis/*microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2007/09/22 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/09/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['200704-606OC [pii]', '10.1164/rccm.200704-606OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2008 Jan 1;177(1):27-34. doi: 10.1164/rccm.200704-606OC.

METHODS: C-kit(+)Lin(-) cells were isolated from mouse bone marrow using a high-gradient magnetic cell sorting system (MACS) and expanded in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF), FLt-3 ligand (FL), leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) thrombopoietin (TPO) and different concentrations of HGF for 7days in a liquid culture system. The total cell number and Annexin-V-positive cell number were counted, and the antigen expressions were studied with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RESULTS: In each group, c-kit(+)Lin(-) cells were expanded effectively and rapidly by 2 to 8 folds. Addition of 10 ng/ml HGF into SCF+FL+LIF+TPO resulted in the most significant expansion of c-kit(+)Lin(-) and total cells by 8.00 and 45.43 folds, respectively, with cell apoptosis rate of 17.42 %. But as the concentration of HGF increased, the c-kit(+)Lin(-) cells and the apoptosis rate decreased.

Initial results with the use of mismatched allograft has been disappointing due to the high incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infectious complications resulting in an unacceptable treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Recent advances with effective T-cell depletion, the use of 'megadose' of stem cells and reduced intensity conditioning has significantly decreased the early transplant related mortality and GvHD, while enabling robust and prompt engraftment, and hence enhancing the therapeutic benefits of haploidentical transplantation. However, the cardinal problems related to delayed immune reconstitution causing posttransplant infectious complications and relapse remain, limiting the efficacy of haploidentical transplant. Preliminary data have demonstrated the great potential in the use of adoptive cellular immunity and selective allodepletion in rapidly reconstituting immunity without GvHD. The encouraging reports from haploidentical transplant using noninherited maternal antigen (NIMA)-mismatched donors or natural killer alloreactive donors may greatly increase the donor availability and open a way to more appropriate donor selection in HLA-haploidentical HSCT. Future challenges remain in determining the safest approach for haploidentical transplant to be performed with minimal risk of GvHD, while preserving effective graft-versus-leukemia activity and promoting prompt immune reconstitution.","['Koh, Liang-Piu', 'Chao, Nelson J']","['Koh LP', 'Chao NJ']","['Adult Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20070919,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['*Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/22 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/09/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00135-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Jan-Feb;40(1):20-4. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.017.

This study investigates whether this combination has any long-term side effects on the medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB). METHODS: In all 47 children of the study suppression of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) by contralateral application of white noise (WN) was used to assess the function of the MOCB. The population was divided into three groups depending on the time interval between the end of therapy and examination. The group examined shortly after chemotherapy included 12 children who had received low gentamicin doses (less than 13 days). The group evaluated 2 years after therapy involved another 12 children who had required medium gentamicin doses (more than 13, less than 23 days). The group examined 3 years after therapy included a subgroup of 12 children to whom low gentamicin doses were infused and another 11 children with high gentamicin doses (more than 23 days). RESULTS: Three years after therapy the olivocochlear reflex was efficiently produced in both subgroups of low and high gentamicin doses. Two years after therapy, contralateral WN induced increase of DPOAEs at 4 of the 12 examined frequencies. Shortly after therapy, WN increased, instead of suppressing, DPOAEs at five frequencies. CONCLUSION: This abnormal result of contralateral noise application perceived as impaired cochlear efferent innervation may indicate that ALL-BFM-95 exerts a toxic effect on the MOCB, which is slowly reversed within the first 3 years after chemotherapy and does not seem to be affected in the long term by different cumulative doses of gentamicin.","['Riga, M', 'Korres, S', 'Varvutsi, M', 'Kosmidis, H', 'Douniadakis, D', 'Psarommatis, I', 'Yiotakis, I', 'Ferekidis, E']","['Riga M', 'Korres S', 'Varvutsi M', 'Kosmidis H', 'Douniadakis D', 'Psarommatis I', 'Yiotakis I', 'Ferekidis E']","['ENT Department, University of Athens, Hippokration Hospital of Athens, 114 Vas.

METHODS: After plasmids construction and transfection, the expression of AbCD71 in the transfectoma supernatant was determined by the sandwich ELISA. Indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to measure the antigen-binding characteristic and the percent CD71-expressed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The antibodies were purified from the ascites via diethylaminoethyl(DEAE)-Sephadex A-50 chromatography and then identified by SDS-PAGE. At last, inhibitory effect of AbCD71 on PHA-induced PBMC proliferation was calculated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay. RESULTS: Constant domain of heavy chain (C(H)) and light chain (C(L)) of AbCD71 were in the human Cgamma family and human Ckappa family, respectively. AbCD71 could compete with its original murine mAb to bind with CD71-positive human leukemia cell line CEM cells. AbCD71 could inhibit the peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin(PHA) in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, especially at time-points 0 and 12 h after induction. There was no statistical difference when compared with original murine mAb. CONCLUSION: The AbCD71 is a promising immunosuppressant.

Overall incidence of AML1-ETO was 28.57% and no correlation was found between AML1-ETO positivity and clinical or hematological parameters except for a direct correlation with absolute blast count (ABC) (a lower ABC in the AML1-ETO positive cases). Interestingly, 1/3 MDS cases were positive for the same fusion transcript and thus, it appears worthwhile to look for AML1-ETO in all cases of MDS with increased blasts. Objective morphological evaluation using a scoring system based on morphological features was not helpful in predicting positivity for AML1-ETO. The effect of this translocation on long-term survival could not be determined by the present study.","['Dutta, Pankhi', 'Hasan, Syed K', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Kumar, Bijender', 'Bhattacharyya, Jina', 'Jain, Monica', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Kumar, Rajat', 'Pati, H P', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Dutta P', 'Hasan SK', 'Sazawal S', 'Kumar B', 'Bhattacharyya J', 'Jain M', 'Tyagi S', 'Kumar R', 'Pati HP', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/09/22 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2007/09/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2007 Jul;50(3):652-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the activity of Wnt signaling and the methylation status of WIF1, DKK3, APC, SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4 and SFRP5 by methylation-specific PCR in myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma samples. Of the four cell lines, Wnt signaling was constitutively activated in LP1 and WL2, correlating with hypermethylation and hence silencing. Moreover, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of these two cell lines showed progressive demethylation of methylated Wnt inhibitors, re-expression of transcripts and downregulation of Wnt signaling. In both LP1 and WL2 cells, multiple Wnts and Fzs were simultaneously expressed. Treatment of WL2, in which SFRP1 was completely methylated, with recombinant secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) induced downregulation of Wnt signaling and inhibition of proliferation. In primary myeloma samples, 42% patients had methylation of at least one of these seven genes, of which 61.9% had > or = 2 genes methylated. In conclusion, Wnt signaling is constitutively activated in myeloma, associated with methylation silencing of one or multiple soluble Wnt antagonists. An autocrine loop regulating Wnt signaling was demonstrated in the myeloma plasma cells, in which cellular proliferation was efficiently inhibited by recombinant SFRP1. Methylation study of a panel of genes, regulating a cellular pathway instead of isolated genes, is important.","['Chim, C S', 'Pang, R', 'Fung, T K', 'Choi, C L', 'Liang, R']","['Chim CS', 'Pang R', 'Fung TK', 'Choi CL', 'Liang R']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. jcschim@hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20070920,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/chemistry']",2007/09/21 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404939 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404939 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2527-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404939.

Pre-Dameshek luminaries who laid the foundation for this unifying concept include Bennett, Virchow, Heuck, Vaquez, Osler, Di Guglielmo and Epstein. In 1960, Nowell and Hungerford discovered the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome in CML. In 1967, Fialkow and colleagues used X-linked polymorphisms to establish CML as a clonal stem cell disease. Also in 1967, the PV Study Group was summoned by Louis Wasserman to study the natural history of PV and conduct large-scale clinical trials. In 1972, Janet Rowley deciphered the Ph chromosome as a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, thus paving the way for its subsequent characterization as an oncogenic BCR-ABL mutation.

In pre-clinical studies, these compounds inhibit JAK2V617F-mediated cell growth at nanomolar concentrations, and in vivo therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in mouse models of JAK2V617F-induced disease. In addition, ex vivo growth of progenitor cells from MPD patients harboring JAK2V617F or MPLW515L/K mutations is also potently inhibited. JAK2 inhibitors currently in clinical trials can be grouped into those designed to primarily target JAK2 kinase (JAK2-selective) and those originally developed for non-MPD indications, but that nevertheless have significant JAK2-inhibitory activity (non-JAK2 selective). This article discusses the rationale for using JAK2 inhibitors for the treatment of MPD, as well as relevant aspects of clinical trial development for these patients. For instance, which group of MPD patients is appropriate for initial Phase I studies? Should JAK2V617F-negative MPD patients be included in the initial studies? What are the likely consequences of 'off-target' JAK3 and wild-type JAK2 inhibition?

At the same time, however, myeloid neoplasms with molecularly characterized clonal eosinophilia, previously classified under CEL/HES, are now removed from the MPN section and assembled into a new category of their own.

METHODS: The expression pattern of PLZF mRNA was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR in HCECs and normal human corneal epithelia. The effect of cell-cell contact on expression of the PLZF gene was studied after incubation of the cultured HCECs in EDTA. The proliferation rate of cultured HCECs was assayed by a real-time electronic sensing (RT-CES) system, and DNA microarray analysis was performed to find the PLZF-regulating genes in cultured HCECs infected with LacZ- and PLZF-carrying adenoviruses (Ad-LacZ, Ad-PLZF). RESULTS: PLZF mRNA was expressed in HCECs in vivo and in completely confluent HCECs but not in subconfluent HCECs in vitro. Real-time PCR showed that the expression of PLZF mRNA was decreased by approximately 20-fold when incubated with EDTA and returned to a normal level as the cell-cell contact reformed. Cell proliferation assay by the RT-CES system showed that infection of cultured HCECs with Ad-PLZF inhibited proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PLZF plays an important role in the suppression of proliferation of HCECs.","['Shiraishi, Atsushi', 'Joko, Takeshi', 'Higashiyama, Shigeki', 'Ohashi, Yuichi']","['Shiraishi A', 'Joko T', 'Higashiyama S', 'Ohashi Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Shitsukawa, Toon, Ehime 791-0295, Japan. shiraia@m.ehime-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Corneal/*cytology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers']",2007/10/27 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/10/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/ICO.0b013e31812f6b67 [doi]', '00003226-200710001-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Cornea. 2007 Oct;26(9 Suppl 1):S55-8. doi: 10.1097/ICO.0b013e31812f6b67.,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, global HOX gene dysregulation is found in the majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and many cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and substantial evidence exists to suggest that aberrant expression of HOX genes contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia. However, although individual HOX genes are rearranged in rare cases of AML and HOX genes are known transcriptional targets of certain leukemia-associated fusion proteins, such as those involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, in the majority of cases, the upstream regulators of HOX genes are unknown. The CDX family of non-clustered homeobox genes are known developmental regulators of HOX gene expression. We have recently demonstrated that Cdx4 is expressed in adult murine bone marrow where its expression pattern follows that of Hox genes. We also demonstrated that CDX2 is expressed in the majority, and that CDX4 is expressed in almost a quarter, of AML patient samples. For CDX2, this expression was predominantly monoallelic but was not associated with coding sequence or promoter mutations, gene amplification, or aberrant promoter methylation. In addition, stable knockdown of CDX2 resulted in a loss of proliferation and clonogenicity in AML cell lines, and bone marrow retrovirally engineered to express either Cdx2 or Cdx4 generated AML in transplant recipients. Cdx4 was shown to cooperate with the known Hox cofactor Meis1a, and structure-function experiments confirmed that the transcription factor function of Cdx4 was required for transformation. Finally, expression of either Cdx2 or Cdx4 generated a dysregulated Hox gene program in normal hematopoietic progenitors and in leukemic tissue. Taken together, these studies implicate CDX proteins as master regulators of HOX gene regulation in AML.","['Frohling, Stefan', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Bansal, Dimple', 'Huntly, Brian J P']","['Frohling S', 'Scholl C', 'Bansal D', 'Huntly BJ']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. sfrohling@rics.bwh.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20070629,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (CDX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (CDX2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CDX2 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Genes, Homeobox/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism']",2007/09/21 09:00,2007/11/13 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['4656 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.6.18.4656 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Sep 15;6(18):2241-5. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.18.4656.

Recent reclassification of CMML as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPS) disease rather than a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has led to a review of CMML patients treated with decitabine. Overall response rates (ORR) (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]) in the subset of patients with CMML in one pivotal phase 3 trial (D-0007) and two phase 2 trials (PCH 95-11, PCH 97-19) decitabine were reviewed. For consistency across trials, all decitabine-treated patients were evaluated using the phase 2 response criteria (CR was defined by normocellular bone marrow with <5% blasts and normal Hgb, WBC, and platelet counts, and PR required 50% decrease in blast count, increases in Hgb by >1.5 mmol/L, WBC count by >1000, and platelet count by >50,000). A total of 31 patients diagnosed with CMML are included in this review. Similar demographics and disease characteristics were observed in all three studies, with an average age of 70.2 years and 71% of patients male. Baseline WBC of >20,000 were observed in 8/28 (29%) patients and baseline bone marrow blasts >5% in 11/28 (39%) patients. All clinical responses were centrally reviewed. The ORR was 25% (14% CR+11% PR). Hematologic improvement was observed in 11% of patients and stable disease in 39% of patients. The decitabine adverse event profile seen in CMML patients was similar to observations in other hematologic patient populations, with myelosuppression and related infectious complications. These data demonstrate encouraging activity for decitabine in CMML, and suggest that studies in other myeloproliferative diseases may be warranted.","['Wijermans, P W', 'Ruter, B', 'Baer, M R', 'Slack, J L', 'Saba, H I', 'Lubbert, M']","['Wijermans PW', 'Ruter B', 'Baer MR', 'Slack JL', 'Saba HI', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Haematology, Haga Hospital, Leyenburg, Leyweg 275, 2545 CH The Hague, The Netherlands. p.wijermans@hagaziekenhuis.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070918,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/21 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00322-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Apr;32(4):587-91. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.004.

In this study, we explored the anticancer effect of UP. Human breast carcinoma cell lines BT-20, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D and one nonmalignant human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, were tested in this study. We found that UP exerted a potent cytotoxicity against all breast carcinoma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, UP showed limited toxicity to MCF-10A cells, indicating UP's cytotoxic effect is selective for malignant cells. UP's cytotoxic effect was due to apoptosis, as confirmed by positive TUNEL signals, annexin V-binding, caspase 9 activation and PARP cleavage. Notably, UP-induced apoptosis was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk, further indicating the involvement of caspase activity. Moreover, UP caused a marked decrease of the levels of antiapoptotic BCL-X(L), Survivin and XIAP while enhancing the levels of proapoptotic BIK, BIM, MCL-1S and NOXA, consequently favoring induction of apoptosis. Additionally, we found that cells with functional p53 (MCF-7, T47D) or mutant p53 (BT-20, MDA-MB-231) were both susceptible to UP's cytotoxicity. Importantly, UP was able to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells with p53 knockdown by RNA interference, confirming the dispensability of p53 in UP-induced apoptosis. Overall, our results establish that UP induces p53-independent apoptosis in breast carcinoma cells with no marked toxicity to nonmalignant cells, raising the possibility of its use as a new chemotherapeutic drug for breast cancer irrespective of p53 status.","['Ho, Tsing-Fen', 'Ma, Chieh-Ju', 'Lu, Chien-Hsing', 'Tsai, Yo-Ting', 'Wei, Yu-Hong', 'Chang, Jo-Shu', 'Lai, Jun-Kai', 'Cheuh, Pin-Ju', 'Yeh, Chi-Tai', 'Tang, Pin-Chi', 'Tsai Chang, Jinghua', 'Ko, Jiunn-Liang', 'Liu, Fu-Shing', 'Yen, Hungchen E', 'Chang, Chia-Che']","['Ho TF', 'Ma CJ', 'Lu CH', 'Tsai YT', 'Wei YH', 'Chang JS', 'Lai JK', 'Cheuh PJ', 'Yeh CT', 'Tang PC', 'Tsai Chang J', 'Ko JL', 'Liu FS', 'Yen HE', 'Chang CC']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070822,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '52340-48-4 (undecylprodigiosin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'OL369FU7CJ (Prodigiosin)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Caspase 9/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Prodigiosin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Serratia marcescens/chemistry', 'Survivin', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/*metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",2007/09/21 09:00,2008/01/26 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(07)00370-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2007.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2007 Dec 15;225(3):318-28. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2007.08.007.

Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) treatment of cell lines derived from multiple myeloma or of myeloma tumor cells ex vivo leads to apoptosis. In this study we demonstrate that IFNalpha treatment of the two myeloma cell lines, U266-1984 and U-1958, results in the decrease of STAT3 activity as demonstrated by a diminished STAT3/3 DNA-binding activity and the shift from STAT3/3 towards STAT1/1 and STAT3/1 complexes in EMSA, leading to the down-regulation of known STAT3 target genes such as Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1 and survivin. Ectopic expression of a form of STAT3, STAT3C, rescued U266-1984 cells from IFNalpha-induced apoptosis. IFNalpha promoted sustained accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3C in the nucleus and a prolonged DNA binding of the STAT3/3 homodimers in EMSA. The shift towards a sustained STAT3 response in IFNalpha-treated STAT3C-transfected cells led to a hyper-induction of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins. Thus our data demonstrated that IFNalpha is able to interfere with IL-6 signaling by inhibiting STAT3 activity and that the abrogation of STAT3 activity accounts for the ability of IFNalpha to induce apoptosis in myeloma cells.","['Thyrell, Lena', 'Arulampalam, Velmurugesan', 'Hjortsberg, Linn', 'Farnebo, Marianne', 'Grander, Dan', 'Pokrovskaja Tamm, Katja']","['Thyrell L', 'Arulampalam V', 'Hjortsberg L', 'Farnebo M', 'Grander D', 'Pokrovskaja Tamm K']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska Hospital and Institute, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070816,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2007/09/21 09:00,2008/01/03 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(07)00386-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2007 Nov 15;313(19):4015-24. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.08.007.

Sysmex has developed a hematology analyzer that can quickly identify a population of immature hematopoietic cells (HPCs) according to cell size, cell density, and differential lysis resistance, which may indicate the presence of PBPCs in PB. This prospective study has evaluated the potential of such method to predict the PBPC mobilization. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 141 patients underwent PBPC mobilization. PB HPCs and PB CD34+ cells were simultaneously quantified with a hematology analyzer (SE2100, Sysmex) and flow cytometry, respectively. The number of blood volumes processed was then based on PB CD34+ cell concentration. RESULTS: The optimal PB HPC level able to predict a minimal level of 10 x 10(6) PB CD34+ cells per L was 5 x 10(6) per L with positive and negative predictive values of 0.93 and 0.36 percent, respectively. For this cutoff point, sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 and 0.65, respectively. The median number of blood volumes processed according to the PB CD34+ cell count allowed us to perform only one apheresis procedure for a majority of patients. CONCLUSION: PB HPC quantification is very useful to quickly determine the initiation of PBPC apheresis especially for patients with higher concentrations. For patients exhibiting a lower HPC count (<5 x 10(6)/L), other parameters such as a CD34 test may be needed. Such a policy associated with a length of apheresis adapted to the richness in the PB CD34+ cells allows for optimizing the organization of centers with an improvement in patient comfort and economical savings.","['Lefrere, Francois', 'Zohar, Sarah', 'Beaudier, Sandrine', 'Audat, Francoise', 'Ribeil, Jean-Antoine', 'Ghez, David', 'Varet, Bruno', 'Cavazzana-Calvo, Marina', 'Dal Cortivo, Liliane', 'Letestu, Remi', 'McIntyre, Elizabeth', 'Brouzes, Chantal']","['Lefrere F', 'Zohar S', 'Beaudier S', 'Audat F', 'Ribeil JA', 'Ghez D', 'Varet B', 'Cavazzana-Calvo M', 'Dal Cortivo L', 'Letestu R', 'McIntyre E', 'Brouzes C']","[""Departement de Biotherapie, Service d'Hematologie Adultes, and Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Necker, 75743 Paris Cedex 15, France. francois.lefrere@nck.aphp.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Blood Component Removal/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/09/21 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01407 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01407.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2007 Oct;47(10):1851-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01407.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the efficacy of leukapheresis in terms of prompt cytoreduction is generally accepted, published data regarding the clinical value of immediate therapeutic leukapheresis are limited and conflicting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine whether leukapheresis has a favorable impact on early mortality, the clinical course of 53 newly diagnosed patients with AML and hyperleukocytosis admitted between 1995 and 2005 was analyzed retrospectively. Before August 2001, 28 patients received chemotherapy without leukoreduction (Cohort A). Thereafter, all AML patients with hyperleukocytosis were scheduled to receive leukapheresis, which was performed in 25 patients (Cohort B). RESULTS: There were no procedure-related adverse events. By Day 21 of therapy, 13 of 53 patients had died, resulting in an overall early death rate of 25 percent. In a multivariate logistic regression model, patients in Cohort B had a significantly lower risk of early death than patients in Cohort A (16% vs. 32%, respectively; p = 0.015). Dyspnea (p = 0.005), elevated creatinine (p = 0.028), and higher lactate dehydrogenase serum levels (p = 0.021) were independent risk factors for early death. With a median follow-up of 24.2 months, the overall survival was similar in both cohorts (Cohort A, 7.5; Cohort B, 6.5 months). Thus, leukapheresis had no impact on patients' long-term survivals. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that AML patients with hyperleukocytosis receiving leukapheresis had a significantly lower risk for early death by Day 21 than patients treated without leukapheresis. We therefore have adopted leukapheresis as a standard procedure in our department.","['Bug, Gesine', 'Anargyrou, Konstantinos', 'Tonn, Torsten', 'Bialleck, Heike', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Bug G', 'Anargyrou K', 'Tonn T', 'Bialleck H', 'Seifried E', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Theodor Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. g.bug@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/21 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01406 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01406.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2007 Oct;47(10):1843-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01406.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct modes of cell death relate to nonspecific necrosis and the initiation of signaling pathways that elicit apoptosis, autophagy or both. In this report, effects of low-dose and high-dose PDT are explored, comparing sensitizers that localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (the porphycene termed CPO) or mitochondria (mesochlorin). To explore the role of autophagy, two cell lines were examined--the murine L1210 leukemia and an Atg7 knockdown derivative of L1210. The Atg7 gene is central to the process of autophagy. High-dose PDT with either sensitizer resulted in a substantial loss of the Bcl-2 protein. As Bcl-2 regulates both apoptosis and autophagy, loss of this protein can lead to initiation of either or both processes. Low-dose PDT with either sensitizer resulted in the initiation of apoptosis in the L1210/Atg7- cell line and a 20% loss of viability. In contrast, the same PDT dose led to the rapid appearance of autophagic cells in the L1210 line, less apoptosis and only a 5% loss of viability. These results are consistent with autophagy serving as a pro-survival response via the recycling of damaged organelles. At a higher PDT dose more apoptosis was again seen in the L1210/Atg7- line, but both cell lines exhibited comparable cytotoxicity in colony formation assays. We conclude that autophagy offers protection from the phototoxic effects of low-dose PDT, but can serve as an alternate death mode when the PDT dose is increased.","['Kessel, David', 'Reiners, John J Jr']","['Kessel D', 'Reiners JJ Jr']","['Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. dhkessel@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Mesoporphyrins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '100572-96-1 (porphycene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects', 'Mesoporphyrins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*toxicity', 'Porphyrins/pharmacology']",2007/09/21 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['PHP088 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-1097.2007.00088.x [doi]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2007 Sep-Oct;83(5):1024-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.2007.00088.x.,,,PMC2768729,,"['R01 CA023378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA023378-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS141197'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored this relationship for patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) served as a measure for depression. One hundred and thirty-eight patients (mean age 41 years; different diagnoses) participating in a psycho-oncology study filled in the HADS after admission for allogeneic HSCT. They were followed-up for at least two years; 72 patients died during follow-up. RESULTS: Depression scores were not correlated with medical and psychosocial objective factors with the exception of having under-aged children. Controlling for medical factors that showed up as predictors for survival in our sample (patient's age at HSCT, having had a transplant before, risk for treatment failure) the HADS depression score (range 0-21) emerged as an independent predictor (Cox regression): hazard ratio = 1.087, 95% CI = 1.018-1.161. CONCLUSION: Depression is probably not a simple indicator of a worse health status. Further research is needed to decide if depression must be considered as an independent risk factor for survival when diagnosed in the pre-transplant period.","['Grulke, Norbert', 'Larbig, Wolfgang', 'Kachele, Horst', 'Bailer, Harald']","['Grulke N', 'Larbig W', 'Kachele H', 'Bailer H']","['University Clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany. norbert.grulke@uniulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Depressive Disorder/*complications/diagnosis/mortality/psychology', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/mortality/*psychology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*psychology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality Inventory/statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', 'Psychometrics', 'Retreatment', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Treatment Failure']",2007/09/21 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.1261 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2008 May;17(5):480-7. doi: 10.1002/pon.1261.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to explore the molecular pathways induced by G-CSF in this tissue, we first reveal the presence of G-CSFR in the JEG-3 human trophoblastic cell line and then examined the phosphorylation of Janus tyrosine kinases (Jak), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) after G-CSF binding to receptors. We showed that Jak1, Jak2, Tyk2, and STAT3 were phosphorylated after incubation with G-CSF. Phosphorylation of p38 and p44/42 MAPK was also activated by G-CSF, and specifically blocked in the presence of the corresponding inhibitors. Similar intracellular pathways were induced by G-CSF in a myeloid leukemia NFS-60 cell line that was studied in parallel. Conversely to cytokine action in myeloid cells, G-CSF did not induce a proliferative response in JEG-3 cells. When the effect of G-CSF on cellular viability was evaluated, cytokine-stimulated JEG-3 cells were protected from foetal serum starvation. In addition, when JEG-3 cells deprived of serum were incubated at different times in the presence of G-CSF, a progressive decrease in the percentage of hypodiploid cells was observed. In summary, we identified the molecular pathways activated after G-CSF binding to trophoblastic cell receptors and showed that G-CSF behaved as a protective cytokine, which supports JEG-3 cells survival.","['Marino, Veronica Julieta', 'Roguin, Leonor Patricia']","['Marino VJ', 'Roguin LP']","['Instituto de Quimica y Fisicoquimica Biologicas (UBA-CONICET), Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'TYK2 Kinase/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2007/09/21 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/09/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21542 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Apr 1;103(5):1512-23. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21542.,,,,,,,"['2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of hospitalized adults receiving systemic antifungal treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the infectious diseases unit (IDU) of the University Hospital of Bordeaux, France between 1996 and 2001. All treatment episodes with antifungal agent were examined and all prescribed concomitant medication identified for potential drug-drug interactions (PDDI)-serious events occurring during treatment were adjudicated for clinical DDI. RESULTS: There were 150 treatment episodes with antifungal agent in 105 patients. Fluconazole was used in 48% of the treatment episodes, amphotericin B in 46%, itraconazole in 4.7% and flucytosine in 1.3%. One hundred and sixteen PDDIs were identified related to the use of amphotericin B (81.0%), fluconazole (17.2%) or itraconazole (1.7%). Of these, 22 were associated with a clinical evidence of adverse interaction (hypokalemia, increased creatininemia or nephrotoxicity). All these clinical drug-drug interactions (CDDIs) were with amphotericin B. They were due to furosemide (36.4%), cyclosporine (31.8%) and hydrocortisone (18.2%).

Thus, diagnostics in the CMPD transform toward a multimodal diagnostic concept based on a combination of methods - cyto-/histomorphology, cytogenetics, and individual molecular methods which can be included in a diagnostic algorithm.","['Haferlach, Torsten', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Haferlach T', 'Bacher U', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munchner Leukamielabor GmbH, Munchen. torsen.haferlach@mll-online.com']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'World Health Organization']",2007/09/20 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00063-007-1094-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2007 Sep 15;102(9):770-7. doi: 10.1007/s00063-007-1094-4.,Neue Erkenntnisse in der Diagnostik chronischer myeloproliferativer Syndrome: Die therapeutische Relevanz steigt.,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no standard therapy for patients whose cGVHD does not resolve with corticosteroid treatment. Pentostatin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, has activity in acute GVHD. We examined the toxicity and efficacy of pentostatin in a prospective phase II trial in corticosteroid-refractory cGVHD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients of any age were eligible. Patients received pentostatin 4 mg/m2 intravenously every 2 weeks for 12 doses, and continued therapy as long as benefit was documented. Corticosteroid taper was begun after three doses of pentostatin. Responses were graded in real time in the skin, mouth, and liver using objective response criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-eight heavily pretreated (median, four prior regimens) patients (median age, 33 years) were enrolled. Results are shown as an intent-to-treat analysis. Of the 58 patients, a total of 32 (55%; 95% CI, 42% to 68%) had an objective response, as evaluated by use of a new grading scale. Infection was the most significant toxicity, with 11 grade 3 to 4 infectious events. The survival at 1 and 2 years was 78% (95% CI, 64% to 86%) and 70% (95% CI, 57% to 80%), with cGVHD with/without infection accounting for the majority of deaths.

Human parathormone (hPTH) secreted from parathyroid glands plays a significant role in calcium homeostasis and is an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis in humans. Here, by using a robust replication-defective Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus vector encapsidated with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein, we generated transgenic chickens expressing hPTH under the control of a ubiquitous Rous sarcoma virus promoter. The recombinant retrovirus was injected into the subgerminal cavity of freshly laid eggs at the blastodermal stage. After 21 d of incubation, 42 chicks hatched from 473 retrovirus-injected eggs. All 42 living chicks were found to express the vector-encoded hPTH gene in diverse organs, as revealed by PCR and reverse transcription-PCR analysis by using primer pairs specific for hPTH. Four days after hatching, 6 chicks died and 14 chicks showed phenotypic deformities. At 18 wk of age, only 3 G(0) chickens survived. They also released the hPTH hormone in their blood and transmitted the hPTH gene to G(1) embryos. However, although the embryos were alive at d 18 of incubation, none hatched. An electrochemiluminescence immunoassay further showed that the hPTH expression level was markedly elevated in mammalian cells infected by the retrovirus vector. Thus, we demonstrated that transgenic chickens, expressing a human protein under the control of a ubiquitous promoter, not only could be an efficient bioreactor for the production of pharmaceutical drugs, but also could be useful for studies on the role of human proteins in embryonic development. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of a human protein (hPTH) in transgenic chickens under the control of a ubiquitous promoter by using a replication-defective Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus vector system.","['Lee, S H', 'Gupta, M K', 'Han, D W', 'Han, S Y', 'Uhm, S J', 'Kim, T', 'Lee, H T']","['Lee SH', 'Gupta MK', 'Han DW', 'Han SY', 'Uhm SJ', 'Kim T', 'Lee HT']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, Bio-Organ Research Center, Konkuk University, 1 Hwayang-dong, Gwangjin-Gu, Seoul, 143 701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,['0 (Parathyroid Hormone)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transgenes/*genetics']",2007/09/20 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)39255-7 [pii]', '10.1093/ps/86.10.2221 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2007 Oct;86(10):2221-7. doi: 10.1093/ps/86.10.2221.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses indicated that men and women differed in rates of being sexually active across time (P < .001) and in overall sexual function (P < .001). Both sexes declined in sexual activity rates and sexual function from before HCT to 6 months afterward (P < or = .05). Activity rates recovered for men by 1 year (74%) and for women by 2 years (55%). Men improved from their 6-month nadir in sexual function by 2 years (P = .02), whereas women did not improve by 5 years (P = .17). Both male and female survivors were below controls in rates of sexual activity and sexual function at 5 years. Most women reported sexual problems (80% of survivors vs 61% of controls, P = .11); in contrast for men 46% of survivors versus 21% of controls (P = .05) reported problems. Thus, despite some recovery, sexual dysfunction remained a major problem for men and women after HCT.

In 19 AML samples with constitutive PI3K/Akt activation, the rapamycin derivative inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) increased Akt phosphorylation. This mTOR C1-mediated Akt up-regulation was explained by an insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/IGF-1 receptor autocrine loop: (1) blast cells expressed functional IGF-1 receptors, and IGF-1-induced Akt activation was increased by RAD001, (2) a neutralizing anti-IGF-1R alpha-IR3 monoclonal antibody reversed the RAD001-induced Akt phosphorylation, and (3) autocrine production of IGF-1 was detected in purified blast cells by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. This RAD001-induced PI3K/Akt up-regulation was due to an up-regulated expression of the IRS2 adaptor. Finally, we observed that concomitant inhibition of mTORC1 and PI3K/Akt by RAD001 and IC87114 induced additive antiproliferative effects. Our results suggest that dual inhibition of the mTORC1 complex and the IGF-1/IGF-1R/PI3K/Akt pathway in AML may enhance the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in treatment of this disease.","['Tamburini, Jerome', 'Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Park, Sophie', 'Sujobert, Pierre', 'Willems, Lise', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Tamburini J', 'Chapuis N', 'Bardet V', 'Park S', 'Sujobert P', 'Willems L', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Mayeux P', 'Lacombe C', 'Bouscary D']","[""Institut Cochin, Departement d'Hematologie, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104), Paris.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070918,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Everolimus', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2007/09/20 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48580-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-03-080796 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):379-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-03-080796.

CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old male presented on 3 separate occasions with symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis: 2 required hospitalization and 1 was noted during a subsequent ambulatory care visit. Prior to the first episode, the methotrexate dose ranged between 17.5 mg and 20 mg given once weekly over 5 years, 11 months. One month before the patient's first admission, the dose was increased to 22.5 mg. Symptoms on presentation included headache, neck stiffness, and fever. Cerebrospinal fluid testing indicated pleocytosis and low glucose level. Methotrexate was discontinued but was restarted 2 weeks after hospital discharge at the same dose and resulted in a second hospitalization for aseptic meningitis. Upon discharge from the second hospitalization, methotrexate was withheld. After a 2 month withdrawal period and rechallenge, the symptoms returned within 3 days. The drug was then discontinued. DISCUSSION: Methotrexate-induced aseptic meningitis has been reported in the literature; however, in those cases, the effect occurred only when methotrexate was given via the intrathecal route. We identified 7 relevant articles via a search of MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and EMBASE (1970-August 3, 2007): 3 were review articles, 2 were case series, and 2 were case reports. All of the series and reports involved patients with leukemia. The available literature suggests that aseptic meningitis is associated with long-term use of methotrexate or recent dose escalation. A definitive mechanism for methotrexate-induced aseptic meningitis is not known. The Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the development of the condition and the methotrexate use in our patient. CONCLUSIONS: Aseptic meningitis has been previously associated with intrathecal use of methotrexate. Our report describes the first case of aseptic meningitis that occurred in a patient being treated with intramuscular methotrexate.","['Hawboldt, John', 'Bader, Mazen']","['Hawboldt J', 'Bader M']","[""School of Pharmacy, Health Sciences Centre, Department of Pharmacy, Eastern Health, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. hawboldt@mun.ca""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20070918,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Meningitis, Aseptic/*chemically induced', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged']",2007/09/20 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['aph.1K308 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1K308 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2007 Nov;41(11):1906-11. doi: 10.1345/aph.1K308.

Mice with a null mutation of IRF8 exhibit uncontrolled expansion of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages that progress into a phenotype resembling human chronic myelogenous leukemia. In human patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, IRF8 transcript levels are frequently diminished. Therefore, IRF8 is a key regulator of myeloid tumor development. In this study, we report that IRF8 is a critical regulator of apoptosis in nonhemopoietic tumor cells. Disruption of IRF8 function with IRF8 dominant-negative mutants diminished Fas-mediated apoptosis in sarcoma tumor cells. Both constitutively expressed and IFN-gamma-activated IRF8 were involved in regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, it was found that constitutively expressed IRF8 is associated with the Fas promoter to activate Fas transcription. In addition, disruption of constitutively expressed IRF8 function diminished JAK1 expression and thereby inhibited IFN-gamma-initiated induction of STAT1 phosphorylation, which in turn, blocked IFN-gamma-induced Fas up-regulation. Interestingly, the constitutively expressed IRF8 was also essential for TNF-alpha sensitization of Fas-mediated apoptosis because disruption of IRF8 function also inhibited TNF-alpha-sensitized and Fas-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that IRF8 is an essential mediator of Fas-mediated apoptosis and that IRF8 mediates apoptosis through regulation of Fas expression in nonhemopoietic tumor cells.","['Yang, Dafeng', 'Thangaraju, Muthusamy', 'Browning, Darren D', 'Dong, Zheng', 'Korchin, Borys', 'Lev, Dina C', 'Ganapathy, Vadivel', 'Liu, Kebin']","['Yang D', 'Thangaraju M', 'Browning DD', 'Dong Z', 'Korchin B', 'Lev DC', 'Ganapathy V', 'Liu K']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sarcoma/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/09/20 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['179/7/4775 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.7.4775 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Oct 1;179(7):4775-82. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.7.4775.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repeated BCR stimulation of normal B cells leads to anergy and CD5 expression, both of which are features of CLL. Because CD5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine following BCR engagement and negatively regulates BCR signaling in normal B cells, we investigated its phosphorylation status and found it to be naturally phosphorylated on tyrosine but not on serine residues in CLL samples. To analyze the role of CD5, we established a B cell line in which CD5 is phosphorylated. Gene profiling of vector vs CD5-transfected B cells pointed out gene groups whose expression was enhanced: Apoptosis inhibitors (BCL2), NF-kappaB (RELB, BCL3), Wnt, TGFbeta, VEGF, MAPKs, Stats, cytokines, chemokines (IL-10, IL-10R, IL-2R, CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCR7), TLR-9, and the surface Ags CD52, CD54, CD70, and CD72. Most of these gene groups are strongly expressed in CLL B cells as compared with normal B cells. Unexpectedly, metabolic pathways, namely cholesterol synthesis and adipogenesis, are also enhanced by CD5. Conversely, CD5 inhibited genes involved in RNA splicing and processing, ribosome biogenesis, proteasome, and CD80 and CD86 Ags, whose expression is low in CLL. Comparison of CD5- vs tailless CD5-transfected cells further demonstrated the role of CD5 phosphorylation in the regulation of selected genes. These results support a model where CLL cells are chronically stimulated, leading to CD5 activation and cell survival. In addition to CD5 itself, we point to several CD5-induced genes as potential therapeutic targets.","['Gary-Gouy, Helene', 'Sainz-Perez, Alexander', 'Marteau, Jean-Brice', 'Marfaing-Koka, Anne', 'Delic, Jozo', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Galanaud, Pierre', 'Dalloul, Ali']","['Gary-Gouy H', 'Sainz-Perez A', 'Marteau JB', 'Marfaing-Koka A', 'Delic J', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Galanaud P', 'Dalloul A']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U 764, Universite Paris XI, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Service de Medecine Interne-Immunologie, Hopital Antoine Beclere, Clamart, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['CD5 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/09/20 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['179/7/4335 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.7.4335 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Oct 1;179(7):4335-44. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.7.4335.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DHA induced dose-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i, which were contributed by intracellular pool, via the production of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) influx, via opening of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. Chemical inhibition of PLC, PKCgamma, and PKCdelta, but not of PKCbeta I/II, PKCalpha, or PKCbetaI, significantly diminished DHA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. In vitro PKC assays revealed that DHA induced a approximately 2-fold increase in PKCgamma and -delta activities, which were temporally correlated with the DHA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. In cell-free assays, DHA, but not other structural analogs of fatty acids, activated these PKC isoforms. Competition experiments revealed that DHA-induced activation of both the PKCs was dose-dependently inhibited by phosphatidylserine (PS). Furthermore, DHA induced apoptosis via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, followed by caspase-3 activation. Chemical inhibition of PKCgamma/delta and of SOC/CRAC channels significantly attenuated both DHA-stimulated ROS production and caspase-3 activity. Our study suggests that DHA-induced activation of PLC/IP3 pathway and activation of PKCgamma/delta, via its action on PS binding site, may be involved in apoptosis in U937 cells.","['Aires, Virginie', 'Hichami, Aziz', 'Filomenko, Rodolphe', 'Ple, Aude', 'Rebe, Cedric', 'Bettaieb, Ali', 'Khan, Naim Akhtar']","['Aires V', 'Hichami A', 'Filomenko R', 'Ple A', 'Rebe C', 'Bettaieb A', 'Khan NA']","[""Unite Propre de Recherche et de l'Enseignement Superieur, Equipe d'Accueil 4183-Lipides & Signalisation Cellulaire, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Burgundy, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070918,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (protein kinase C gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/*physiology', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/chemistry/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2007/09/20 09:00,2008/01/05 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.107.039792 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.107.039792 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2007 Dec;72(6):1545-56. doi: 10.1124/mol.107.039792.

We show that upon several types of stress, endogenous PML proteins form nucleolar caps and eventually engulf nucleolar components. Only two specific PML splice variants (PML-I and PML-IV) are efficiently targeted to the nucleolus and the abundant PML-I isoform is required for the targeting of endogenous PML proteins to this organelle. We identified a nucleolar targeting domain within the evolutionarily conserved C-terminus of PML-I. This domain contains a predicted exonuclease III fold essential for the targeting of the PML-I C-terminus to nucleolar fibrillar centres. Furthermore, spontaneous or oncogene retrieval-induced senescence is associated with the formation of very large PML nuclear bodies that initially contain nucleolar components. Later, poly-ubiquitin conjugates are found on the outer shell or within most of these senescence-associated PML bodies. Thus, unexpectedly, the scarcely studied PML-I isoform links PML bodies, nucleolus, senescence and proteolysis.","['Condemine, Wilfried', 'Takahashi, Yuki', 'Le Bras, Morgane', 'de The, Hugues']","['Condemine W', 'Takahashi Y', 'Le Bras M', 'de The H']","['CNRS/Universite de Paris 7 UMR7151, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Contre le Cancer, Hopital St. Louis, 1 Av.

The basic helix-loop-helix factor SCL and the LIM-only protein LMO2 are components of transcription factor complexes that are essential for hematopoiesis. Here we show that LMO2 and SCL are predominant interaction partners in hematopoietic cells and that this interaction occurs through a conserved interface residing in the loop and helix 2 of SCL. This interaction nucleates the assembly of SCL complexes on DNA and is required for target gene induction and for the stimulation of erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We also demonstrate that SCL determines LMO2 protein levels in hematopoietic cells and reveal that interaction with SCL prevents LMO2 degradation by the proteasome. We propose that the SCL-LMO2 interaction couples protein stabilization with higher order protein complex assembly, thus providing a powerful means of modulating the stoichiometry and spatiotemporal activity of SCL complexes. This interaction likely provides a rate-limiting step in the transcriptional control of hematopoiesis and leukemia, and similar mechanisms may operate to control the assembly of diverse protein modules.","['Lecuyer, Eric', 'Lariviere, Simon', 'Sincennes, Marie-Claude', 'Haman, Andre', 'Lahlil, Rachid', 'Todorova, Margarita', 'Tremblay, Mathieu', 'Wilkes, Brian C', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Lecuyer E', 'Lariviere S', 'Sincennes MC', 'Haman A', 'Lahlil R', 'Todorova M', 'Tremblay M', 'Wilkes BC', 'Hoang T']","['Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche Clinique de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et Cancerologie and the Departments of, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Pharmacology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 2J7, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C 2J7, Canada.

However, it possesses important drawbacks like a poor biological half-life and the induction of resistance. With the objective of overcoming the above drawbacks, we designed a new nanomedicine of gemcitabine and studied its anticancer efficacy against leukemia at preclinic. Gemcitabine has been covalently coupled with 1,1',2-tris-nor-squalenic acid to obtain the new anticancer nanomedicine 4-(N)-Tris-nor-squalenoyl-gemcitabine (SQdFdC NA). The SQdFdC NA exhibited, in comparison to gemcitabine, 3.26- and 3.22-folds higher cytotoxicity respectively, in murine resistant leukemia L1210 10K cells and in human leukemia resistant cell line CEM/ARAC8C. Following intravenous treatment of murine aggressive metastatic leukemia L1210 wt bearing mice, the SQdFdC NA caused significant increase in survival time compared to gemcitabine and also led to long-term survivals, which was not the case after gemcitabine treatment. This was attributed to significantly higher deposition of SQdFdC NA in spleen and liver (P<0.05), the major metastatic organs. In comparison to gemcitabine, SQdFdC NA displayed greater ability to induce S-phase arrest of the cancer cells followed by increased apoptotic induction. Interestingly, like gemcitabine, SQdFdC NA didn't induce appreciable differences in blood parameters even at doses higher than those used for anticancer evaluation. The preclinical data obtained in vitro and in vivo with SQdFdC NA demonstrate that this nanomedicine represents a new therapeutic system for the effective treatment of leukemia.","['Reddy, L Harivardhan', 'Dubernet, Catherine', 'Mouelhi, Sinda Lepetre', 'Marque, Pierre Emmanuel', 'Desmaele, Didier', 'Couvreur, Patrick']","['Reddy LH', 'Dubernet C', 'Mouelhi SL', 'Marque PE', 'Desmaele D', 'Couvreur P']","['Universite Paris-Sud XI, Faculte de Pharmacie, UMR CNRS 8612, IFR 141, 92296 Chatenay-Malabry Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070823,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (4-(N)-tris-nor-qualenoyl-gemcitabine)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7QWM220FJH (Squalene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nanomedicine/*methods', '*Nanoparticles/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Squalene/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tissue Distribution']",2007/09/20 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(07)00424-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.08.018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2007 Dec 4;124(1-2):20-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.08.018.

Cancer chemoprevention is defined as an approach where natural or synthetic chemical compound works to arrest or reverse premalignant cells by using physiological pathways. As a consequence, such a clone of premalignant cells is eradicated (clonal deletion) by differentiation induction or apoptosis, and thus the process toward the development of clinically detectable cancer is disrupted. A particularly effective candidate target of chemoprevention in liver diseases is an advanced stage of chronic hepatitis, that is supposed to contain transformed hepatocyte clone(s); that is, primary prevention from liver cirrhosis and prevention of recurrent and second primary hepatocellular carcinoma following the treatment of the initial cancer. Retinoid is a collective term of vitamin A analog that binds to nuclear retinoid receptors;retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR). After ligand coupling, these receptors form homo- or heterodimers, bind to the response element (RARE or RXRE) upstream of the target gene, and regulate the gene expression as a transcriptional factor. Biological phenotypes of such transcriptional regulation by retinoid include cellular differentiation, tissue morphogenesis, and programmed cell death (apoptosis).

METHODS: RT-PCR was used to amplify 24 subfamily genes of TCRBV from peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes in twenty-four leukemia patients underwent three kinds of allo-HSCT and in five normal donors as control. The PCR products were further analyzed by genescan to evaluate the clonality of BV subfamily and characteristics of CDR3 and calculate usage rate of BV subfamily. The monoclonal bands which associated with GVHD and CMV infection were obtained by denaturation polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequenced. Comparison of the sequences of TCRBV CDR3 with other CDR3 sequences which associated with GVHD or CMV infection was reported. RESULTS: 2 approximately 19 months after transplantation, there were 6 approximately 14 BV subfamilies expressed and the polyclonal expression reached 33% in nine patients underwent haploidentical bone marrow transplantation(HI-BMT). In five patients underwent matched unrelated peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( MU-PBSCT), there were 10 approximately 15 BV subfamilies expressed of which 45% were poly-clones. In 10 patients underwent matched sibling bone marrow transplantation(MS-BMT), 10 approximately 16 BV subfamilies were expressed and more than 48% of them were poly-clones. Monoclones and oligo-clones existed in 24 BV subfamilies but no common one monoclone BV subfamilies was found. Immune reconstitution in patients underwent HI-BMT was later than that in other two groups. In 2 patients TCRBV was detected in 2m and 3m after allo-HSCT and found that there was a tendency of increasing usage of BV subfamilies and increasing expression of CDR3 polymorphism. Twenty three TCRBV CDR3 molecules associated with GVHD and CMV infection were compared each other by bioinformatics and found that different cases of the same BV subfamilies may share similarity in amino acid motif, while in different BV subfamilies none appeared to share the same amino acid motif. CONCLUSION: In 1.5 years after allo-HSCT, the usage of TCRBV subfamilies still restricted. Immune reconstitution in patients underwent HI-BMT was later than that in other two groups.

As failure of Interferon-alpha had been associated with poor prognosis and results of IM-treatment in this patient group may allow earlier estimation of long-term benefits for early chronic phase patients. Therefore we prospectively analyzed the quality and duration of remissions and the rate of BCR-ABL resistance mutations occurring in patients treated with IM, if they were intolerant or refractory to interferon. Fifty-nine patients were included and median follow up is 4.75 years. Haematologic remission rate was 92% and 62% of patients achieved at least major cytogenetic remission. There were no major differences between patients failing or being refractory to IFN. Major molecular response was observed in 67% of patients evaluable. For the entire group, median PFS was 4.3 years and OS was 82% at 4.75 years. Haematologic and complete cytogenetic remissions, but not molecular responses were correlated with improved PFS and OS. In patients with progression or inadequate response, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations were detected in 3/28 patients. IM resulted in prolonged remission rates in a substantial proportion after IFN-failure/intolerance, with no differences in these patient groups. Quality of hematologic and cytogenetic, but not molecular response was associated with duration of remissions and survival.

METHODS: The expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and MMP-3 were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Northern blotting. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was assessed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: IL-17A and IL-17F significantly enhanced IL-6, IL-8, LIF, MMP-1, and MMP-3 secretion. The effects of IL-17A were relatively stronger than those induced by IL-17F. The effects of IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, and IL-17E were modest as compared with those induced by IL-17A and IL-17F. Both IL-17A and IL-17F augmented IL-1beta-induced secretion of IL-6, IL-8, LIF, MMP-1, and MMP-3. A similar augmentation was also observed in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced cytokine and MMP secretion. IL-17A and IL-17F rapidly induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, p38 MAPKs, and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) as early as 15 min after stimulation. Inhibitors for ERK (PD98059 and U0216) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) significantly reduced the IL-17F-induced IL-6, IL-8, LIF, MMP-1, and MMP-3 secretion.

Immunofluorescence colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous p160 and Prep1 are induced by ActD, which translocates p160 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm.

The fusion gene combines sequences encoding a strong transactivating domain from the EWS protein with the DNA binding domain of FLI-1, an ETS transcription factor. A related fusion, TLS/ERG, has been found in myeloid leukemia. To determine EWS/FLI-1 function in vivo, we engineered mice with Cre-inducible expression of EWS/FLI-1 from the ubiquitous Rosa26 locus. When crossed with Mx1-cre mice, Cre-mediated activation of EWS/FLI-1 resulted in the rapid development of myeloid/erythroid leukemia characterized by expansion of primitive mononuclear cells causing hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, severe anemia, and death. The disease could be transplanted serially into naive recipients. Gene expression profiles of primary and transplanted animals were highly similar, suggesting that activation of EWS/FLI-1 was the primary event leading to disease in this model.

Other unusual clinical forms have been reported that exhibit the features of dermatomyositis and lupus erythematosus. Within a large population of individuals who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation because of hematologic malignancy, a group of patients was identified in whom severe and persistent eczema developed. OBSERVATIONS: We prospectively evaluated 10 adult patients with unexplained eczematous dermatosis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The dermatosis developed between 2 and 18 months (mean, 7.5 months) after receipt of the transplant, exhibited the typical clinical features of dermatitis, and became erythrodermic in each case. The patient group had strong risk factors for chronic cutaneous GVHD: 8 had received a transplant from an unrelated donor, 7 had evidence of extracutaneous GVHD, and 7 had a history of acute cutaneous GVHD. Sampling of lesional skin revealed the histologic features of GVHD coexisting with the changes of dermatitis. The patients were treated with topical corticosteroid and systemic immunosuppressive agents. Six patients also received psoralen-UV-A. Four patients achieved prolonged remission. Six patients died, 5 of infective complications and 1 of relapsed leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The eczematous dermatosis observed represents a novel form of chronic cutaneous GVHD that we named eczematoid GVHD. Eczematoid GVHD is an aggressive, chronic dermatosis that requires substantial immunosuppression therapy to achieve control. It is associated with a poor prognosis. Although atopy can be transmitted to an individual from a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, none of the donors in this series gave a history of an atopic disorder. Therefore, other factors must be implicated in provoking the expression of an eczematous phenotype in individuals with underlying chronic graft-vs-host activity.","['Creamer, Daniel', 'Martyn-Simmons, Claire L', 'Osborne, Genevieve', 'Kenyon, Michelle', 'Salisbury, Jon R', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Pagliuca, Antonio', 'Ho, Aloysius Y', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'du Vivier, Anthony W P']","['Creamer D', 'Martyn-Simmons CL', 'Osborne G', 'Kenyon M', 'Salisbury JR', 'Devereux S', 'Pagliuca A', 'Ho AY', 'Mufti GJ', 'du Vivier AW']","[""Department of Dermatology, King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, England. daniel.creamer@kingsch.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', 'KTZ7ZCN2EX (Ficusin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Eczema/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Ficusin/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*PUVA Therapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use']",2007/09/19 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['143/9/1157 [pii]', '10.1001/archderm.143.9.1157 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2007 Sep;143(9):1157-62. doi: 10.1001/archderm.143.9.1157.,,,,,,,,,,['Arch Dermatol. 2008 Aug;144(8):1066; author reply 1066-7.

Eight patients with myeloid malignancies received one subcutaneous dose each of PR1 and WT1 vaccines in Montanide adjuvant, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Patients were reviewed weekly for 4 weeks to monitor toxicity and immunologic responses. Toxicity was limited to grades 1 to 2. Using peptide/HLA-A 0201 tetramers and intracellular interferon-gamma staining, CD8(+) T cells against PR1 or WT1 were detected in 8 of 8 patients after a single vaccination. To monitor the kinetics of vaccine-induced CD8(+) T-cell responses and disease regression after vaccination, absolute PR1 and WT1(+)CD8(+) T-cell numbers and WT1 expression were studied weekly after vaccination. Responses occurred as early as 1 week after vaccination. After vaccination, the emergence of PR1 or WT1(+)CD8(+) T cells was associated with a decrease in WT1 mRNA expression as a marker of minimal residual disease, suggesting a vaccine-driven antileukemia effect. Conversely, loss of response was associated with reappearance of WT1 transcripts (P < .01). This is the first demonstration that a combined PR1 and WT1 vaccine is immunogenic. These results support further studies of combination immunization strategies in leukemia patients.","['Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Yong, Agnes S M', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Musse, Laura', 'Superata, Jeanine', 'Jafarpour, Behnam', 'Boss, Carol', 'Barrett, A John']","['Rezvani K', 'Yong AS', 'Mielke S', 'Savani BN', 'Musse L', 'Superata J', 'Jafarpour B', 'Boss C', 'Barrett AJ']","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1201, USA. rezvanik@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20070917,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RMFPNAPYL)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/immunology/therapy', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",2007/09/19 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48562-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-108241 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):236-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-108241.

Lym-1 antibody, which binds selectively to HLA-DR10 on malignant B-cell lymphocytes, has proved to be effective in delivering radionuclides to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. Using a new approach to create small synthetic molecules that mimic the targeting properties of the Lym-1 antibody, a prototype, selective high-affinity ligand (SHAL), has been developed to bind to a unique region located within the Lym-1 epitope on HLA-DR10. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Computer docking methods were used to predict two sets of small molecules that bind to neighboring cavities on the beta subunit of HLA-DR10 surrounding a critical amino acid in the epitope, and the ligands were confirmed to bind to the protein by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Pairs of these molecules were then chemically linked together to produce a series of bidentate and bisbidentate SHALs. RESULTS: These SHALs bind with nanomolar to picomolar K(d)'s only to cell lines expressing HLA-DR10. Analyses of biopsy sections obtained from patients also confirmed that SHAL bound to both small and large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas mimicking the selectivity of Lym-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that synthetic molecules less than 1/50th the mass of an antibody can be designed to exhibit strong binding to subtle structural features on cell surface proteins similar to those recognized by antibodies. This approach offers great potential for developing small molecule therapeutics that target other types of cancer and disease.","['Balhorn, Rod', 'Hok, Saphon', 'Burke, Patricia A', 'Lightstone, Felice C', 'Cosman, Monique', 'Zemla, Adam', 'Mirick, Gary', 'Perkins, Julie', 'Natarajan, Arutselvan', 'Corzett, Michele', 'DeNardo, Sally J', 'Albrecht, Huguette', 'Gregg, Jeff P', 'DeNardo, Gerry L']","['Balhorn R', 'Hok S', 'Burke PA', 'Lightstone FC', 'Cosman M', 'Zemla A', 'Mirick G', 'Perkins J', 'Natarajan A', 'Corzett M', 'DeNardo SJ', 'Albrecht H', 'Gregg JP', 'DeNardo GL']","['Chemistry, Materials and Life Sciences and Computations, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California, 94550, USA. balhorn2@llnl.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Serological Subtypes)', '0 (HLA-DR10 antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lym-1 monoclonal antibody)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomimetic Materials/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HLA-DR Antigens/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'HLA-DR Serological Subtypes', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Streptavidin/metabolism']",2007/09/19 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/18/5621s [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1128 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 15;13(18 Pt 2):5621s-5628s. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1128.,,,,,['P01-CA47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The murine EL4 lymphoma cell line was used for in vitro studies and the EL4 model in which apoptosis was induced with cyclophosphamide and etoposide was used for in vivo studies. In vitro studies compared 3B9 binding in the EL4 cell with that in its counterpart primary cell type of the thymocyte. For in vivo studies, 3B9 was intrinsically or extrinsically labeled with carbon-14 or 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacylododecane-N,N',N'',N''''-tetraacetic acid-indium-111, respectively, and biodistribution of the radiotracers was investigated in EL4 tumor-bearing mice, which were treated or not with chemotherapy. RESULTS: La-specific 3B9 mAb bound EL4 cells rather than thymocytes, and binding was detergent resistant. 3B9 binding to dead EL4 cells in vitro was specific, rapid, and saturable. Significantly, more 3B9 bound dead EL4 tumor explant cells after host mice were treated with chemotherapy, which suggested that DNA damage induced 3B9 binding. Tumor binding of 3B9 in vivo was antigen specific and increased significantly after chemotherapy. Tumor accumulation of 3B9 peaked at approximately 50% of the injected dose per gram of tumor 72 h after chemotherapy and correlated with increased tumor cell death.

This study aimed to further examine the mechanism of ROS-mediated apoptosis induced by EGCG and its relationship to the heme enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established stably transfected K562 cells expressing wild-type and mutant MPO. Then, sensitivity against EGCG and other ROS-inducing agent was examined and further investigated the detailed molecular mechanism of ROS-inducing apoptosis in MPO-positive leukemic cells. RESULTS: EGCG rapidly induced apoptosis in MPO-positive leukemia cells. Preincubation of myeloid leukemic cells with the MPO-specific inhibitor, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, and the heme biosynthesis inhibitor, succinylacetone, resulted in inhibition of the intracellular MPO activity, ROS production, and induction of apoptosis following addition of EGCG. Overexpression of MPO sensitized EGCG-resistant K562 cells to apoptosis induced by EGCG. In contrast, an enzymatically inactive MPO mutant-expressing K562 cell could not respond to EGCG, suggesting that MPO is important for determining the sensitivity to EGCG-induced oxidative stress. Hypochlorous acid scavengers and the hydroxyl radical (.OH) scavenger inhibited EGCG-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemic cells. The fluorescence intensity of both aminophenyl fluorescein- and hydroxyphenyl fluorescein-loaded myeloid leukemic cells significantly increased on stimulation with EGCG, indicating that EGCG generated highly toxic ROS in myeloid leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that highly toxic ROS such as .OH generated via the hydrogen peroxide/MPO/halide system induce apoptosis and that ROS may be the direct mediators of EGCG-induced apoptosis in MPO-positive leukemic cells.","['Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Sagawa, Morihiko', 'Yamato, Kenji', 'Xian, Mingji', 'Yamamoto, Takehiro', 'Suematsu, Makoto', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Nakazato T', 'Sagawa M', 'Yamato K', 'Xian M', 'Yamamoto T', 'Suematsu M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '5351-17-7 (4-aminobenzhydrazide)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heme/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",2007/09/19 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/18/5436 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0481 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 15;13(18 Pt 1):5436-45. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0481.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the genes associated with CLL patient subgroups with high and low CD38 expression and their potential role in disease progression is not known. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To identify the genes associated with the clinical disparity in CLL patients with high versus low CD38 expression, transcriptional profiles were obtained from CLL cells from 39 different patients using oligonucleotide microarray. Gene expression was also compared between CLL cells and B cells from healthy individuals. RESULTS: Gene expression analysis identified 76 differentially expressed genes in CD38 high versus low groups. Out of these genes, HEM1, CTLA4, and MNDA were selected for further studies and their differential expression was confirmed by real-time PCR. HEM1 overexpression was associated with poor outcome, whereas the overexpression of CTLA4 and MNDA was associated with good outcome. Down-regulation of HEM1 expression in patient CLL cells resulted in a significant increase in their susceptibility to fludarabine-mediated killing. In addition, when gene expression patterns in CD38 high and low CLL cells were compared with normal B-cell profiles, ATM expression was found to be significantly lower in CD38 high compared with CD38 low CLL as confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR.

The molecular basis for MDS progression is unknown, but a key element in MDS disease progression is loss of chromosomal material (genomic instability). Using our two-step mouse model for myeloid leukemic disease progression involving overexpression of human mutant NRAS and BCL2 genes, we show that there is a stepwise increase in the frequency of DNA damage leading to an increased frequency of error-prone repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) by nonhomologous end-joining. There is a concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these transgenic mice with disease progression. Importantly, RAC1, an essential component of the ROS-producing NADPH oxidase, is downstream of RAS, and we show that ROS production in NRAS/BCL2 mice is in part dependent on RAC1 activity. DNA damage and error-prone repair can be decreased or reversed in vivo by N-acetyl cysteine antioxidant treatment. Our data link gene abnormalities to constitutive DNA damage and increased DSB repair errors in vivo and provide a mechanism for an increase in the error rate of DNA repair with MDS disease progression.

By comparison, recovery of leukemic cells from bone marrow (21 of 39) or peripheral blood (8 of 22) was substantially lower. The engraftment pattern of CLL PBMC 4 weeks posttransplant was correlated with clinical disease activity: infusion of PBMC from donors with Binet stage A, lymphocyte doubling time of >12 months, and normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels led to marked engraftment of T cells whereas comparably few tumor cells could be detected. In contrast, NOD/SCID mice receiving PBMC from donors with advanced stage Binet C, lymphocyte doubling time of <12 months, and elevated LDH serum levels exhibited predominant engraftment of tumor cells and comparably low numbers of T cells.

The AML leukemic cells express platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) and CD38, two adhesion molecules that could interact with microenvironmental elements, i.e., CD31 on the surface of marrow endothelial cells (CD31/CD31 and CD38/CD31 interactions) and hyaluronate (CD38/hyaluronate interactions). We report a physical association of these two antigens on the plasma membrane of myeloid leukemic cells. In this context, in vitro experiments done using interaction-blocking anti-CD31 and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (CLB-HEC75 and OKT10, respectively) indicate that an excess of CD31 on the cell membrane of leukemic cells (CD31/CD38 MFI ratio >1) promotes a homotypic interaction with marrow endothelial cells, resulting in higher transendothelial migration. Conversely, an excess of CD38 (CD31/CD38 MFI ratio <1) allows leukemic cells to be entrapped within the bone marrow microenvironment through hyaluronate adhesion. The results obtained in vitro using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, co-capping, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and hyaluronate adhesion and transendothelial migration assays, are supported by immunophenotypic characterization of marrow leukemic cells from 78 AML patients on which CD38 expression levels were found to be positively correlated with those of CD31. Importantly, the excess of CD31 in those samples was associated with a higher peripheral WBC count. These findings indicate that bone marrow retention of AML cells depends on CD31 and CD38 coexpression levels.","['Gallay, Nathalie', 'Anani, Ludovic', 'Lopez, Adriana', 'Colombat, Philippe', 'Binet, Christian', 'Domenech, Jorge', 'Weksler, Babette B', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Herault, Olivier']","['Gallay N', 'Anani L', 'Lopez A', 'Colombat P', 'Binet C', 'Domenech J', 'Weksler BB', 'Malavasi F', 'Herault O']","['INSERM ESPRI-EA3855, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Endothelial Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2007/09/19 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/18/8624 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0402 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 15;67(18):8624-32. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis method (454 sequencing) was used to directly sequence >100 bisulfite PCR products in a single sequencing run without subcloning. We showed the utility, robustness, and superiority of this approach by analyzing methylation in 25 gene-related CpG rich regions from >40 cases of primary cells, including normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). A total of 294,631 sequences was generated with an average read length of 131 bp. On average, >1,600 individual sequences were generated for each PCR amplicon far beyond the few clones (<20) typically analyzed by traditional bisulfite sequencing. Comprehensive analysis of CpG methylation patterns at a single DNA molecule level using clustering algorithms revealed differential methylation patterns between diseases. A significant increase in methylation was detected in ALL and FL samples compared with CLL and MCL. Furthermore, a progressive spreading of methylation was detected from the periphery toward the center of select CpG islands in the ALL and FL samples. The ultradeep sequencing also allowed simultaneous analysis of genetic and epigenetic data and revealed an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism and the methylation present in the LRP1B promoter.

The findings suggest a basis to understand the pathobiology of CSC and possible strategies to attack them to undermine the self-renewal capacity of a tumor.","['Faber, Joerg', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Faber J', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/09/19 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/18/8425 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0972 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 15;67(18):8425-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0972.,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a novel strategy for identifying proteins that are altered in their expression levels in a diseased cell using cell specific aptamers. Using an intact viable B-cell Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Ramos cells) as the target, we have selected aptamers that recognize cell membrane proteins with high affinity. Among the selected aptamers that showed different recognition patterns with different cell lines of leukemia, the aptamer TD05 showed binding with Ramos cells. By chemically modifying TD05 to covalently cross-link with its target on Ramos cells to capture and to enrich the target receptors using streptavidin coated magnetic beads followed by mass spectrometry, we were able to identify membrane bound immunoglobin heavy mu chain as the target for TD05 aptamer. Immunoglobin heavy mu chain is a major component of the B-cell antigen receptor, which is expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. This study demonstrates that this two step strategy, the development of high quality aptamer probes and then the identification of their target proteins, can be used to discover new disease related potential markers and thus enhance tumor diagnosis and therapy. The aptamer based strategy will enable effective molecular elucidation of disease related biomarkers and other interesting molecules.","['Mallikaratchy, Prabodhika', 'Tang, Zhiwen', 'Kwame, Sefah', 'Meng, Ling', 'Shangguan, Dihua', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Mallikaratchy P', 'Tang Z', 'Kwame S', 'Meng L', 'Shangguan D', 'Tan W']","['Department of Chemistry, Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida Genetics Institute and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20070917,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Aptamers, Peptide)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)']",IM,"['*Aptamers, Peptide', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding']",2007/09/19 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)31912-5 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M700026-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2007 Dec;6(12):2230-8. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M700026-MCP200.

Expression of each of the MDR genes was independent of the initial white blood cell count, immunophenotype, National Cancer Institute risk classification, and prednisone response. Interestingly, MDR1 expression was significantly higher at relapse than at diagnosis for 4 sample pairs. Evaluation of MDR1 expression at diagnosis of childhood ALL may contribute to the early identification of patients at risk of treatment failure.","['Kourti, M', 'Vavatsi, N', 'Gombakis, N', 'Sidi, V', 'Tzimagiorgis, G', 'Papageorgiou, T', 'Koliouskas, D', 'Athanassiadou, F']","['Kourti M', 'Vavatsi N', 'Gombakis N', 'Sidi V', 'Tzimagiorgis G', 'Papageorgiou T', 'Koliouskas D', 'Athanassiadou F']","['Second Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece. makourti@med.auth.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*genetics']",2007/09/19 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['45K6X10331R2W55H [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.E0624 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Aug;86(2):166-73. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.E0624.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve outcomes, novel therapeutics designed to target the unusual biology of these leukemias need to be developed. Previously, we identified an interaction between the two most common MLL fusion proteins, AF4 and AF9, and designed a synthetic peptide (PFWT) capable of disrupting this interaction. PFWT induced cell death in leukemia cells expressing MLL-AF4 with little effect on the colony forming potential of hematopoietic progenitor cells, suggesting the AF4-AF9 complex is an important pharmacological target for leukemia therapy and PFWT is a promising chemotherapeutic prototype. In these studies, we demonstrate that PFWT induces death by necrosis in MV4-11 cells. Cell death is characterized by rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity with maintenance of nuclear membrane integrity, and is independent of caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. PFWT-mediated necrosis is inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor TLCK, suggesting this death pathway is regulated. Given the resistance of t(4;11) leukemias to conventional chemotherapeutic agents that induce apoptosis, further identification of the molecular events mediating this death process should uncover new avenues for therapeutic intervention.","['Palermo, Christine M', 'Bennett, Cecily A', 'Winters, Amanda C', 'Hemenway, Charles S']","['Palermo CM', 'Bennett CA', 'Winters AC', 'Hemenway CS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070917,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comet Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/09/19 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00318-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Apr;32(4):633-42. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.08.002.

Novel treatment modalities exploiting donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells generate an alloreactive graft-versus-leukaemia response and eliminate the residual malignant clones in transplanted patients. NK cells are components of the innate immunity playing an important role in the surveillance of human tumours. Recognition of malignant cells depends on a dynamic balance between antagonistic functions of an array of NK activating and inhibitory receptors. The natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) are NK cell-specific and together with the NKG2D receptor are responsible for NK cell activation and tumour cell killing. The killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) recruit phosphatases and can antagonise the activating signals and prevent the cytolytic NK cell programme. Understanding of the integration of these multiple signals at the molecular level is central for exploring the cytolytic function of NK cells. This review describes molecular mechanisms of NK receptor-ligand interactions controlling target cell recognition and addresses the potential of NK cells for the specific elimination of leukaemic clones with the goal of advancing immunotherapy of leukaemia.","['Wodnar-Filipowicz, A', 'Kalberer, Christian P']","['Wodnar-Filipowicz A', 'Kalberer CP']","['Department of Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,,,,2007/09/19 09:00,2007/09/19 09:01,['2007/09/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:01 [medline]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2007 Mar 2;137 Suppl 155:25S-30S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Swiss Med Wkly. 2006 Jun 10;136(23-24):359-64.

Here, we describe studies assessing the role of NOTCH1 mutations in LCH, which were based on a case of fatal Langerhans cell tumor after T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although the two types of neoplasm in this patient were temporally and pathologically distinct, molecular analyses showed that they harbored the same T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and two activating NOTCH1 mutations involving exons 27 and 34. The exon 27 mutation altered a conserved cysteine residue in the N-terminal portion of the NOTCH1 heterodimerization domain, while the mutation in exon 34 introduced a premature stop codon that results in the deletion of C-terminal negative regulatory PEST domain. Analysis of cDNA prepared from the aggressive Langerhans cell tumor showed that the NOTCH1 mutations were aligned in cis, a configuration that caused synergistic increases in NOTCH1 signal strength in reporter gene assays. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the Langerhans cell tumor also expressed NOTCH1 protein. Although these data suggested that NOTCH1 mutations might contribute to the pathogenesis of typical sporadic LCH and related neoplasms occurring in the absence of T-ALL, an analysis of 24 cases of LCH and Rosai-Dorfman Disease occurring in patients without an antecedent history of T-ALL revealed no mutations. Thus, activating NOTCH1 mutations appear to be unique to aggressive Langerhans cell tumors occurring after T-ALL. Persistent expression of NOTCH1 in such tumors suggests that Notch pathway inhibitors could have a role in the treatment of these unusual neoplasms.","['Rodig, Scott J', 'Payne, Ethan G', 'Degar, Barbara A', 'Rollins, Barrett', 'Feldman, Andrew L', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Androkites, Arlene', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Longtine, Janina A', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Fleming, Mark D', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Rodig SJ', 'Payne EG', 'Degar BA', 'Rollins B', 'Feldman AL', 'Jaffe ES', 'Androkites A', 'Silverman LB', 'Longtine JA', 'Kutok JL', 'Fleming MD', 'Aster JC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Base Pairing', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Histiocytosis, Sinus/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21044 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Feb;83(2):116-21. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21044.,,,,,"['P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI050225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA082308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WithaferinA, a major chemical constituent of Withania somnifera, reportedly shows cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor cell lines while its molecular mechanisms of action are not fully understood. We observed that withaferinA primarily induces oxidative stress in human leukemia HL-60 cells and in several other cancer cell lines. The withanolide induced early ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(mt)) loss, which preceded release of cytochrome c, translocation of Bax to mitochondria and apoptosis inducing factor to cell nuclei. These events paralleled activation of caspases -9, -3 and PARP cleavage. WA also activated extrinsic pathway significantly as evidenced by time dependent increase in caspase-8 activity vis-a-vis TNFR-1 over expression. WA mediated decreased expression of Bid may be an important event for cross talk between intrinsic and extrinsic signaling.

METHODS: Pubmed databases were searched for case-control studies published between 1990 and 2005 investigating the relation between hematopoietic cancers and occupational exposure to pesticides. Fixed and random effect meta-analysis models were used depending on the presence of heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: The overall meta-odds ratio obtained after pooling 44 ORs from 13 studies was 1.3 (95% CI: 1.3-1.5). We realized stratified analysis on three different types of hematopoietic cancers (non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), leukemia and multiple myeloma). A significant increased risk of NHL was found (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.2-1.5). Moreover, increased risks of Leukemia (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.9-2) and multiple myeloma (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.99-1.36) were also detected but these results were not statistically significant. Significant heterogeneity existed among the different studies and a publication bias was detected. Therefore, a meta-regression was carried out. Our results showed that a long period of exposure (more than 10 years) provided an increase in the risk of all hematopoietic cancers and for NHL by fractions of 2.18 (95% CI = 1.43-3.35) and 1.65 (95% CI = 1.08-2.51), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The overall meta-odds ratio suggests that there is a significantly positive association between occupational exposure to pesticides and all hematopoietic cancers as well as NHL. A major limitation of our meta-analysis is the lack of sufficient data about exposure information and other risk factors for hematopoietic cancer (genetic predisposition, ethnic origin, immunodepression...). In addition, data concerning specific subtypes of hematopoietic cancers are often confusing. Thus, future epidemiological studies should undertake a major effort to assess the identity and the level of pesticides exposure and should control for the most likely potential confounders.","['Merhi, M', 'Raynal, H', 'Cahuzac, E', 'Vinson, F', 'Cravedi, J P', 'Gamet-Payrastre, L']","['Merhi M', 'Raynal H', 'Cahuzac E', 'Vinson F', 'Cravedi JP', 'Gamet-Payrastre L']","['UMR 1089 Xenobiotiques, INRA, 180 Chemin de Tournefeuille, Toulouse 31931, France. mmerhi@toulouse.inra.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20070915,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', '*Models, Statistical', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'PubMed', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/04/12 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-007-9061-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2007 Dec;18(10):1209-26. doi: 10.1007/s10552-007-9061-1.

In vitro cytotoxicity and induction of lipid peroxidation by ATRA (10 microM) and alpha-TS (25 or 50 microM) were evaluated in primary leukemic cells by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay and malondialdehyde formation respectively. Treatment of leukemic cells with alpha-TS alone or in combination with ATRA significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the cell viability in a concentration and time dependent manner as compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from normal healthy controls. Lipid peroxidation was enhanced by 98% (P < 0.05) on combined treatment of cells with ATRA (10 microM) and alpha-TS (50 microM). ATRA alone did not enhance the externalization of phosphatidyl serine as studied by annexin-V binding using fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis, whereas in combination with alpha-TS it increased to 400% at 12 h. The treatment of leukemic cells to combination of ATRA with alpha-TS significantly decreased (P < 0.05) mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced lysosomal destabilization. The combination of these drugs also increased mitochondrial and cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, nitric oxide levels, and caspase-3 activity significantly and caused DNA fragmentation at 24 h in a concentration dependent manner in the leukemic cells. Our data suggest that ATRA in combination with alpha-TS efficiently induces apoptosis in leukemic cells, which may be a useful therapeutic modality in CML patients.","['Kumar, Surender', 'Khanduja, Krishan Lal', 'Verma, Neelam', 'Verma, Subhash C', 'Avti, Pramod Kumar', 'Pathak, Chander Mohan']","['Kumar S', 'Khanduja KL', 'Verma N', 'Verma SC', 'Avti PK', 'Pathak CM']","['Department of Biophysics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20070915,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Lysosomes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Tocopherols', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin E/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-007-9590-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2008 Jan;307(1-2):109-19. doi: 10.1007/s11010-007-9590-7.

Furthermore, we estimated event-free survival (EFS) on the basis of the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Between 1998 and 2006 we performed 37 fully MSD and 36 fully MUD HSCTs. All patients received identical conditioning regimens with cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation and dual GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CSA) and methotrexate (MTX). Three-year cumulative incidence of relapse for the MSD and MUD groups were 55.6+/-12.3 and 22.0+/-8.1%, respectively (P=0.03). Three-year EFS according to aGVHD was 32.7+/-12.2% for no aGVHD, 61.2+/-10.0% for grade I-II aGVHD and 66.7+/-11.1% for grade III-IV aGVHD. Three-year EFS and overall survival (OS) were 40.5+/-11.6, 49.1+/-9.5% for the MSD group, and 60.5+/-8.7, 62.3+/-8.4% for the MUD group. In children with ALL receiving dual GVHD prophylaxis, relapse rate is significantly higher among recipients of MSD compared to MUD transplantation, which may in part be attributed to a better GVL effect with the unrelated graft.","['Gassas, A', 'Sung, L', 'Saunders, E F', 'Doyle, J']","['Gassas A', 'Sung L', 'Saunders EF', 'Doyle J']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. adam.gassas@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070917,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Siblings', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/09/18 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705853 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705853 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Nov;40(10):951-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705853.

However, the enthusiasm for these therapies has been tempered by tumor resistance and the paucity of information on the oncogenic programs regulated by oncogenic NOTCH1. Here we show that NOTCH1 regulates the expression of PTEN (encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the activity of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway in normal and leukemic T cells. Notch signaling and the PI3K-AKT pathway synergize in vivo in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Notch-induced tumorigenesis, and mutational loss of PTEN is associated with human T-ALL resistance to pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1. Overall, these findings identify transcriptional control of PTEN and regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as key elements of the leukemogenic program activated by NOTCH1 and provide the basis for the design of new therapeutic strategies for T-ALL.","['Palomero, Teresa', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa', 'Cortina, Maria', 'Real, Pedro J', 'Barnes, Kelly', 'Ciofani, Maria', 'Caparros, Esther', 'Buteau, Jean', 'Brown, Kristy', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Agarwal, Archana M', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Castillo, Mireia', 'Nagase, Satoru', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Parsons, Ramon', 'Zuniga-Pflucker, Juan Carlos', 'Dominguez, Maria', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Palomero T', 'Sulis ML', 'Cortina M', 'Real PJ', 'Barnes K', 'Ciofani M', 'Caparros E', 'Buteau J', 'Brown K', 'Perkins SL', 'Bhagat G', 'Agarwal AM', 'Basso G', 'Castillo M', 'Nagase S', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Parsons R', 'Zuniga-Pflucker JC', 'Dominguez M', 'Ferrando AA']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070916,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drosophila/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transgenes']",2007/09/18 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1636 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1636 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2007 Oct;13(10):1203-10. doi: 10.1038/nm1636.

Immunohistological stains with mast-cell tryptase and CD117 antibodies performed on the liver-biopsy tissue showed prominent mast cells. Subsequently, bone-marrow biopsy and small-bowel biopsies also showed mast-cell infiltration confirming the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. The patient underwent treatment with imatinib mesylate without response. Her disease transformed into acute myeloid leukemia and she ultimately died from sepsis. This case underscores the importance of including rare conditions like systemic mastocytosis in the differential diagnosis of cholestatic disorders.","['Kupfer, Sonia S', 'Hart, John', 'Mohanty, Smruti R']","['Kupfer SS', 'Hart J', 'Mohanty SR']","['Center for Liver Diseases, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637-1463, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,9000874,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cholestasis, Intrahepatic/*etiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Mastocytosis/*complications/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MEG.0b013e3281ac20ba [doi]', '00042737-200710000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2007 Oct;19(10):901-5. doi: 10.1097/MEG.0b013e3281ac20ba.,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study analyzes whether rat retinal progenitor cells differentiated into photoreceptor phenotypic cells in neurospheres have a potential to interact with rat retinal explants. Immunocytochemistry for rhodopsin and synaptophysin indicated photoreceptor cell-like differentiation in neurospheres that were stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor. Differentiation into neural phenotypes including photoreceptor cells was effectively blocked by an addition of leukemia inhibitory factor. Grafting of neurospheres onto retinal explants demonstrated a consistent penetration of glial cell processes into the explanted tissue. On the other hand, the incorporation of donor cells into explants was very low. A general finding was that neurospheres grafting was associated with local decrease in Muller cell activation in the explants. Further characterization of these effect(s) could provide further insight into progenitor cell-based therapies of retinal degenerative disorders.","['Liljekvist-Larsson, Ingela', 'Johansson, Kjell']","['Liljekvist-Larsson I', 'Johansson K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Lund University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070622,England,J Neural Eng,Journal of neural engineering,101217933,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Host vs Graft Reaction/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retina/*cytology/physiology/*surgery', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1741-2560(07)47730-8 [pii]', '10.1088/1741-2560/4/3/011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neural Eng. 2007 Sep;4(3):255-63. doi: 10.1088/1741-2560/4/3/011.

This study shows how tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) regulates the expression of the leukemia inhibitor factor receptor (LIFR) gp190 in RBE4 cells. The high expression of LIFR was rapidly downregulated by the proinflammatory agents lipopolysaccharide, TNF, and LIF. Downregulation by TNF affected LIFR endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, preceding decreased LIFR mRNA. Lysosomal inhibitors reversed the rapid disappearance of LIFR, whereas inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway did not. Rather, blockade of proteasome activity, as well as inhibition of NFkappaB activation, reduced the basal expression of LIFR. Thus, NFkappaB activity and proteasome degradation of IkappaB stabilized LIFR and prevented its rapid lysosomal degradation. By a non-NFkappaB-mediated mechanism, TNF facilitated LIFR degradation and reduced LIFR activation indicated by pStat3. The novel opposite effects of proteasomes and lysosomes in controlling receptor expression shows the functional implications and interactions of circulating inflammatory cytokines in acutely modulating BBB activity.","['Yu, Chuanhui', 'Kastin, Abba J', 'Tu, Hong', 'Pan, Weihong']","['Yu C', 'Kastin AJ', 'Tu H', 'Pan W']","['The Blood-Brain Barrier Group, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, 6400 Perkins Road, Baton Rouge, LA 70808, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Mol Neurosci,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,"['0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2007/09/18 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/01/30 00:00 [received]', '1999/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['JMN:32:1:80 [pii]', '10.1007/s12031-007-0017-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Neurosci. 2007;32(1):80-9. doi: 10.1007/s12031-007-0017-4.,,,,,"['NS 45751/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 54880/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046528/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045751/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 46528/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data indicate that viral infections can alter the structure of lymph node innervation. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying sympathetic denervation during Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection, we assessed the expression of neurotrophic factors and neuromodulatory cytokines within lymph nodes from experimentally infected rhesus macaques. Transcription of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) decreased significantly in vivo during chronic SIV infection, whereas expression of the neuro-inhibitory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) was up-regulated. Acute SIV infection of macaque leukocytes in vitro induced similar changes in the expression of neurotrophic and neuro-inhibitory factors, indicative of an innate immune response. Statistical mediation analyses of data from in vivo lymph node gene expression suggested that coordinated changes in expression of multiple neuromodulatory factors may contribute to SIV-induced depletion of catecholaminergic varicosities within lymphoid tissue. Given previous evidence that lymph node catecholaminergic varicosities can enhance SIV replication in vivo, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced expression of neurotrophic factors during infection could constitute a neurobiological component of the innate immune response to viral infection.","['Sloan, Erica K', 'Nguyen, Christina T', 'Cox, Benjamin F', 'Tarara, Ross P', 'Capitanio, John P', 'Cole, Steve W']","['Sloan EK', 'Nguyen CT', 'Cox BF', 'Tarara RP', 'Capitanio JP', 'Cole SW']","['University of California Los Angeles, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, CA, USA. esloan@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070917,Netherlands,Brain Behav Immun,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",8800478,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Leukocytes/immunology/virology', 'Lymph Nodes/innervation/physiology/virology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*genetics', 'Neurotrophin 3/genetics', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/growth & development/*immunology', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/*immunology/*virology', 'Virus Replication']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0889-1591(07)00165-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbi.2007.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Behav Immun. 2008 Feb;22(2):185-94. doi: 10.1016/j.bbi.2007.07.008.

Here we report that PEDF can also induce the apoptosis of human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cell line-derived macrophage cells (THP-1 macrophages) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a pleiotropic transcriptional factor is involved in the signaling. TUNEL and propidium iodide permeability assays demonstrated that PEDF dose- and time-dependently induces both apoptosis and necrosis of THP-1 macrophages while inducing the cleavages of procaspase-9, -3, the release of cytochrome c and the overexpression of p53. All these PEDF effects can be attenuated by either PPARgamma inhibitor GW9662 or PPARgamma small interfering RNA. The effects of PEDF can be reproduced by transient expression of PPARgamma by a PPARgamma-expression plasmid transfection. PEDF increased the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARgamma in THP-1 macrophages.

CLL/SLL may proceed through different phases: an early phase in which tumor cells are predominantly small in size, with a low proliferation rate and prolonged cell survival, and a transformation phase with the frequent occurrence of extramedullary proliferation and an increase in large, immature cells. Although some patients with CLL have an indolent disease course and die after many years of unrelated causes, others have very rapidly disease progression and die of the disease within a few years of the diagnosis. In the past few years, considerable progress has been made in our ability to diagnose and classify CLL accurately. Through cytogenetics and molecular biology, it has been shown that CLL and variants are associated with a unique genotypic profile and that these genetic lesions often have a direct bearing on the pathogenesis and prognosis of the disease. Similarly, the development of antibodies to new biologic markers has allowed the identification of a unique immunophenotypic profile for CLL and variants. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that CLL cells respond to selected microenvironmental signals and that this confers a growth advantage and an extended survival to CLL cells. In this article, we will review the progress in the pathobiology of CLL and give an update on prognostic markers and tools in current pathology practice for risk stratification of CLL.","['Inamdar, Kedar V', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Inamdar KV', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Ann Diagn Pathol,Annals of diagnostic pathology,9800503,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",2007/09/18 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1092-9134(07)00125-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2007.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Diagn Pathol. 2007 Oct;11(5):363-89. doi: 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2007.08.002.,,278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite efforts, the fundamental pathway by which NO exerts its inhibitory actions remains to be elucidated although recent evidence suggests that the transcription factor Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) may be important. WT1 has been linked to numerous developmental pathways in particular nephrogenesis. Due to its roles in development and cell proliferation, polymorphisms within the WT1 gene can result in malignancies such as leukemia and Wilms tumor. WT1 functions as a transcriptional regulator and its activity is controlled through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). PKA-dependent WT1 phosphorylation results in translocation of WT1 from the nucleus to the cytosol, a process that interferes with WT1 transcriptional activities. In the current study we demonstrate that WT1 is expressed in human lymphocytes. Using the proliferative compound PHA we induced T cell proliferation and growth correlated with an increase in the expression of WT1 measured by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunoblot. Co-stimulation with the NO donor SNOG at concentrations of 0, 100, 300 and 600 microM reduced in a concentration dependent way the PHA-induced upregulation of WT1 that correlated with a reduction in T cell proliferation. We conclude that WT1 might be an important component of the NO-dependent regulation of T lymphocyte proliferation and potential function.","['Marcet-Palacios, Marcelo', 'Davoine, Francis', 'Adamko, Darryl J', 'Moqbel, Redwan', 'Befus, A Dean']","['Marcet-Palacios M', 'Davoine F', 'Adamko DJ', 'Moqbel R', 'Befus AD']","['Pulmonary Research Group, Department of Medicine, 550A Heritage Medical Research Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alta., Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070904,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (WT1 Proteins)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Nitric Oxide/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/09/18 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)01827-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.08.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Nov 16;363(2):283-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.08.159.

As a novel anticancer agent for treatment of solid cancers, As(2)O(3) is promising and the mechanism has been not still fully understood. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is one common tumor in head and neck cancers. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of As(2)O(3) on LSCC cell line HEP-2, and their possible involvement in As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. METHODS: The cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay method and the morphological changes were observed by an inverted microscope and acridine orange (AO) staining. The caspase-3 activity was measured by a fluorophotometer. The expression of survivin mRNA was evaluated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated an apoptotic effect of As(2)O(3) in LSCC cell line Hep-2. In Hep-2 cells, As(2)O(3) decreased the cell viability, inhibited the growth and proliferation, induced apoptosis and increased the activity of caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. And the expression of survivin mRNA was also decreased in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: We concluded that As(2)O(3) induced the apoptosis of Hep-2 cells via down-regulating the expression of survivin mRNA.","['Cheng, Baohua', 'Yang, Xinxin', 'Han, Zaiwen', 'An, Liangxiang', 'Liu, Shuwei']","['Cheng B', 'Yang X', 'Han Z', 'An L', 'Liu S']","['Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070914,Netherlands,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Auris, nasus, larynx",7708170,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Caspase 3/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/05/01 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0385-8146(07)00132-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anl.2007.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Auris Nasus Larynx. 2008 Mar;35(1):95-101. doi: 10.1016/j.anl.2007.07.009.

Resveratrol acts both by suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines. In this study, we show that RES induces apoptosis in MOLT-4 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells by modulating three different pathways that regulate cells survival and cell death. We show for the first time that RES inhibits the survival signalling pathways Notch and their down stream effector and modulates the operation of interacting signalling systems. It induces an increase in the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, its effector p21waf and Bax. We also show that RES inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway and activates Gsk-3beta. The data presented here demonstrate unequivocally that RES induces apoptosis by inhibiting the Notch pathway and markedly influencing the operation of the interacting apoptosis pathways mediated by p53 and PI3K/Akt. These data support findings from other laboratories that have suggested the use of RES as a chemopreventive agent. Here, we have identified potential signalling pathways influenced by RES and this could lead to the identification of the targets of RES-induced apoptosis and growth control.","['Cecchinato, Valentina', 'Chiaramonte, Raffaella', 'Nizzardo, Monica', 'Cristofaro, Brunella', 'Basile, Andrea', 'Sherbet, Gajanan V', 'Comi, Paola']","['Cecchinato V', 'Chiaramonte R', 'Nizzardo M', 'Cristofaro B', 'Basile A', 'Sherbet GV', 'Comi P']","['Department of Biomedical Science and Technology, University of Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070807,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '37297-20-4 (phytoalexins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lithium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(07)00536-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2007.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Dec 3;74(11):1568-74. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.08.001.

Here we describe a new approach, directly measuring cellular HDAC enzymatic activity using the substrate Boc-K(Ac)-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). After penetration into HeLa cervical carcinoma or K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells, the deacetylated product Boc-K-AMC is formed which, after cell lysis, is cleaved by trypsin, finally releasing the fluorophor AMC. The cellular potency of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, LBH589, trichostatin A, and MS275 as well-known HDAC inhibitors was determined using this assay. IC(50) values derived from concentration-effect curves correlated well with EC(50) values derived from a cellomics array scan histone H3 hyperacetylation assay. The cellular HDAC activity assay was adapted to a homogeneous format, fully compatible with robotic screening. Concentration-effect curves generated on a Tecan Genesis Freedom workstation were highly reproducible with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.7 and a Z' factor of 0.88, indicating a very robust assay. Finally, a HDAC-inhibitor focused library was profiled in a medium-throughput screening campaign. Inhibition of cellular HDAC activity correlated well with cytotoxicity and histone H3 hyperacetylation in HeLa cells and with inhibition of human recombinant HDAC1 in a biochemical assay. Thus, by using Boc-K(Ac)-AMC as a cell-permeable HDAC substrate, the activity of various protein lysine-specific deacetylases including HDAC1-containing complexes is measurable in intact cells in a simple and homogeneous manner.","['Ciossek, Thomas', 'Julius, Heiko', 'Wieland, Heike', 'Maier, Thomas', 'Beckers, Thomas']","['Ciossek T', 'Julius H', 'Wieland H', 'Maier T', 'Beckers T']","['Therapeutic Area Oncology, ALTANA Pharma-a member of the Nycomed Group, Byk-Gulden Str. 2, 78467 Konstanz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070802,United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Automation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Robotics', 'Substrate Specificity']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2697(07)00481-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2007.07.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2008 Jan 1;372(1):72-81. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2007.07.024.

As observed for follistatin, FLRG is involved in the regulation of various biological processes through its binding to members of the TGFbeta (transforming growth factor beta) superfamily, activin, BMPs (bone morphogenetic proteins) and myostatin. Unlike follistatin, FLRG has been found to be both secreted and localized within the nucleus of many FLRG-producing cells, suggesting the existence of specific intracellular functions of the protein. RESULTS: In order to analyse the function of the nuclear form of FLRG, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, in which we identified AF10 [ALL1 (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) fused gene from chromosome 10], a translocation partner of the MLL (mixed-lineage leukaemia) oncogene in human leukaemia, as a FLRG-interacting protein. This interaction was confirmed by far-Western-blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation with transfected COS-7 cells. The N-terminal region of AF10, including the PHD (plant homeodomain), is sufficient to mediate this interaction, and has been shown to be involved in AF10 homo-oligomerization. By immunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that FLRG enhances the homo-oligomerization of AF10. Functional studies demonstrated that FLRG enhances the transactivation properties of the AF10 protein fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domains in transient transfection assays. CONCLUSIONS: Our present study provides novel insights into the function of the nuclear form of the FLRG protein, which is revealed as a novel regulator of transcription. The nuclear isoform of FLRG lacks an intrinsic transactivation domain, but enhances AF10-mediated transcription, probably through promoting the homo-oligomerization of AF10, thus facilitating the recruitment of co-activators.","['Forissier, Stephanie', 'Razanajaona, Diane', 'Ay, Anne-Sophie', 'Martel, Sylvie', 'Bartholin, Laurent', 'Rimokh, Ruth']","['Forissier S', 'Razanajaona D', 'Ay AS', 'Martel S', 'Bartholin L', 'Rimokh R']","['Inserm, U590, Centre Leon Berard, Universite Lyon 1, Lyon, F-69003, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Follistatin-Related Proteins)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Follistatin-Related Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2007/09/18 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bc20060131 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 2007 Oct;99(10):563-71. doi: 10.1042/bc20060131.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we selected a sequence of hTERT containing two antigenic epitopes that have high affinity for HLA-A2 (human leucocyte antigen-A2) as a TAA (tumour-associated antigen) based on a peptide-motif scoring system. The sequence was obtained by reverse-transcriptase PCR and cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-4T-1. The expression product appeared in the form of inclusion bodies. Denatured inclusion-body extract was subjected to SDS/PAGE, and the gel band corresponding to the putative 38 kDa fusion protein (GST-hTERT major tumour-associated antigen) was excised, ground with PBS, mixed with Freund's adjuvant and used to inoculate mice, generating anti-TERT polyclonal antibodies.

Bone marrow- or peripheral blood-derived allogeneic SCT from an HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor cures more than half the patients with severe aplastic anaemia, thalassaemia major, congenital immunodeficiency diseases and genetic metabolic disorders. Among the malignant conditions, acute and chronic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and high risk neuroblastoma are important conditions that can be treated by HSCT. The major morbidities associated with HSCT are regimen-related toxicities, development of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), failure of engraftment of the bone marrow and complications related to the immunodeficiency that occurs in the post-transplant period. Peripheral blood stem cells are now being used as an alternative to bone marrow stem cells for allogeneic HSCT and exclusively for autologous HSCT. Reduced intensity conditioning for allogeneic HSCT has resulted in a lower frequency and severity of GVHD and risk of infections. This has resulted in allogeneic HSCT being done in older patients and for those with co-morbid conditions. Patients with low grade Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and multiple myeloma appear to benefit more with this approach. Prevention of acute GVHD while maintainingthe graft-versus-tumour effect and close monitoring of the kinetics of chimerism hold promise for improving the outcome of those receiving reduced intensity allogeneic HSCT. In recipients ofautologous HSCT, identification of patients at increased risk for relapse and use of agents (interferon, interleukin-2) post-transplant to augment the graft-versus-tumour effect are possible areas of further research.","['Kumar, Lalit']",['Kumar L'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India. lalitaiims@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,,IM,"['Anemia/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Metabolic Diseases/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', '*Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation']",2007/09/18 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2007/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2007 May-Jun;20(3):128-37.,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, we identified PNAS-2, a human apoptosis-related protein gene, using gene expression profiling. In this study, we tried to clarify the role of PNAS-2 in apoptosis and leukemogenesis. METHODS: NB4 and U937 leukemia cell lines and serial clinical samples were studied. RNA interference (RNAi) and RNA overexpression were used to address the potential role of PNAS-2 in apoptosis. PNAS-2 expression was examined using Northern blot in multiple tissues, and real-time PCR was applied to analyze PNAS-2 expression in various patient samples. RESULTS: Functional analyses of PNAS-2 by RNAi and RNA overexpression indicate PNAS-2 is an anti-apoptosis gene. PNAS-2 expression is significantly increased in de novo or relapsed acute leukemia, but in patients in complete remission PNAS-2 levels decrease to levels comparable to those found in normal controls. In carcinomas, PNAS-2 expression was not upregulated, indicating that PNAS-2 overexpression was specific for leukemia. CONCLUSION: Based on the preliminary data, we suggest that the PNAS-2 gene functions as an anti-apoptotic gene and probably participates in leukemogenesis.","['Wang, Hai-Rong', 'Gu, Chun-Hong', 'Zhu, Jian-Yi', 'Han, Jie-Yin', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Chen, Fang-Yuan', 'Ouyang, Ren-Rong']","['Wang HR', 'Gu CH', 'Zhu JY', 'Han JY', 'Zhong H', 'Chen FY', 'Ouyang RR']","['Department of Hematology, Ren-Ji Hospital and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070914,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (PNAS-2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/09/15 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['000108576 [pii]', '10.1159/000108576 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2006;71(5-6):423-9. doi: 10.1159/000108576.

The proviral integrations suggest an enhancer effect on Sox10. All Moloney murine leukemia virus/PDGFB tumors had a high protein expression of Sox10 independently of malignant grade or tumor type. To investigate the role of Sox10 in gliomagenesis, we used the RCAS/tv-a mouse model in which the expression of retroviral-encoded genes can be directed to glial progenitor cells (Ntv-a mice). Both Ntv-a transgenic mice, wild-type, and Ntv-a p19Arf null mice were injected with RCAS-SOX10 alone or in combination with RCAS-PDGFB. Infection with RCAS-SOX10 alone did not induce any gliomas. Combined infection of RCAS-SOX10 and RCAS-PDGFB in wild-type Ntv-a mice yielded a tumor frequency of 12%, and in Ntv-a Arf-/- mice the tumor frequency was 30%. This indicates that Sox10 alone is not sufficient to induce gliomagenesis but acts synergistically with PDGFB in glioma development. All induced tumors displayed characteristics of PNET-like structures and oligodendroglioma. The tumors had a strong and widely distributed expression of Sox10 and PDGFR-alpha. We investigated the expression of Sox10 in other human tumors and in a number of gliomas. The Sox10 expression was restricted to gliomas and melanomas. All glioma types expressed Sox10, and tumors of low-grade glioma had a much broader distribution of Sox10 compared with high-grade gliomas.","['Ferletta, Maria', 'Uhrbom, Lene', 'Olofsson, Tommie', 'Ponten, Fredrik', 'Westermark, Bengt']","['Ferletta M', 'Uhrbom L', 'Olofsson T', 'Ponten F', 'Westermark B']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Rudbeck Laboratory C11, Dag Hammarskjoldsv 20, S-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.

Here, we investigate the etiologies of treatment failure in this model and design approaches to enhance the efficacy of this adoptive strategy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A panel of modified CD19-targeted CARs designed to deliver combined activating and costimulatory signals to the T cell was generated and tested in vitro to identify an optimal second-generation CAR. Antitumor efficacy of T cells expressing this optimal costimulatory CAR, 19-28z, was analyzed in mice bearing systemic costimulatory ligand-deficient NALM-6 tumors. RESULTS: Expression of the 19-28z CAR, containing the signaling domain of the CD28 receptor, enhanced systemic T-cell antitumor activity when compared with 19z1 in treated mice. A treatment schedule of 4 weekly T-cell injections, designed to prolong in vivo T-cell function, further improved long-term survival. Bioluminescent imaging of tumor in treated mice failed to identify a conserved site of tumor relapse, consistent with successful homing by tumor-specific T cells to systemic sites of tumor involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Both in vivo costimulation and repeated administration enhance eradication of systemic tumor by genetically targeted T cells. The finding that modifications in CAR design as well as T-cell dosing allowed for the complete eradication of systemic disease affects the design of clinical trials using this treatment strategy.","['Brentjens, Renier J', 'Santos, Elmer', 'Nikhamin, Yan', 'Yeh, Raymond', 'Matsushita, Maiko', 'La Perle, Krista', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Larson, Steven M', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Brentjens RJ', 'Santos E', 'Nikhamin Y', 'Yeh R', 'Matsushita M', 'La Perle K', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Larson SM', 'Sadelain M']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070912,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/09/15 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-07-0674 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0674 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 15;13(18 Pt 1):5426-35. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0674.

The ParaHox gene CDX2 was shown to act as positive upstream regulator of several HOX genes. In this study, constitutive expression of Cdx2 caused perturbation of leukemogenic Hox genes such as Hoxa10 and Hoxb8 in murine hematopoietic progenitors. Deletion of the N-terminal domain of Cdx2 abrogated its ability to perturb Hox gene expression and to cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice. In contrast inactivation of the putative Pbx interacting site of Cdx2 did not change the leukemogenic potential of the gene. In an analysis of 115 patients with AML, expression levels of CDX2 were closely correlated with deregulated HOX gene expression. Patients with normal karyotype showed a 14-fold higher expression of CDX2 and deregulated HOX gene expression compared with patients with chromosomal translocations such as t(8:21) or t(15;17). All patients with AML with normal karyotype tested were negative for CDX1 and CDX4 expression. These data link the leukemogenic potential of Cdx2 to its ability to dysregulate Hox genes. They furthermore correlate the level of CDX2 expression with HOX gene expression in human AML and support a potential role of CDX2 in the development of human AML with aberrant Hox gene expression.","['Rawat, Vijay P S', 'Thoene, Silvia', 'Naidu, Vegi M', 'Arseni, Natalia', 'Heilmeier, Bernhard', 'Metzeler, Klaus', 'Petropoulos, Konstantin', 'Deshpande, Aniruddha', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Buske, Christian']","['Rawat VP', 'Thoene S', 'Naidu VM', 'Arseni N', 'Heilmeier B', 'Metzeler K', 'Petropoulos K', 'Deshpande A', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Bohlander SK', 'Spiekermann K', 'Hiddemann W', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C']","['Department of Medicine III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070912,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (CDX2 protein, human)', '0 (Cdx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CDX2 Transcription Factor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2007/09/15 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48571-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-085407 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):309-19. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-085407.

Here, we immunopurified proteins associated with ENL, a protein commonly fused to MLL. Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). The composition of EAP was further verified by coimmunoprecipitation, 2-hybrid analysis, pull-down, and colocalization experiments. Purified EAP showed a histone H3 lysine 79-specific methylase activity, displayed a robust RNAPolII CTD kinase function, and counteracted the effect of the pTEFb inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-benzimidazole-riboside.

To examine the role of this domain in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) replication, we analyzed 18 insertional mutations in this region. All mutants were noninfectious. Based on the results of this analysis and our previous studies on additional mutations in this domain, we were able to divide the NTD of MoMLV CA into three functional regions. The first functional region included the region near the N terminus that forms the beta-hairpin and was shown to control normal maturation of virions. The second region included the helix 4/5 loop and was essential for the formation of spherical cores. The third region encompassed most of the NTD except for the above loop. Mutants of this region assembled imperfect cores, as seen by detailed electron microscopy analyses, yet the resulting particles were efficiently released from cells. The mutants were defective at a stage immediately following entry of the core into cells. Despite possessing functional reverse transcriptase machinery, these mutant virions did not initiate reverse transcription in cells. This block could be due to structural defects in the assembling core or failure of an essential host protein to interact with the mutant CA protein, both of which may prevent correct disassembly upon entry of the virus into cells. Future studies are needed to understand the mechanism of these blocks and to target these regions pharmacologically to inhibit retroviral infection at additional stages.","['Auerbach, Marcy R', 'Brown, Kristy R', 'Singh, Ila R']","['Auerbach MR', 'Brown KR', 'Singh IR']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070912,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Capsid Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Virion/*chemistry/genetics/ultrastructure']",2007/09/15 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01286-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01286-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Nov;81(22):12337-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01286-07.

We sequenced 1.5 kilobases of the DCK proximal promoter and all seven coding exons in International HapMap Project panels (n = 90 each) with European (Centre d' Etude du Polymorphisme Humain; CEPH) or African (Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria; YRI) ancestry. Sixty-four genetic polymorphisms, including three nonsynonymous coding changes (I24V, A119G, and P122S) were identified. Compared with DCK-wild-type (WT) protein, the activity of the recombinant DCK24Val, DCK119Gly, and DCK122Ser proteins was 85 +/- 5, 66 +/- 3, and 43 +/- 4%, respectively. DCK119Gly and DCK122Ser mutants had lower Km (p < 0.01) and Vmax (p < 0.001) compared with DCK-WT protein. Lymphoblast cell lines from subjects heterozygous for the coding changes had significantly lower DCK activity compared with homozygous WT subjects. Ethnic differences were observed, with African ancestry subjects demonstrating significantly higher DCK mRNA expression compared with subjects with European ancestry. In both CEPH and YRI subjects, the C allele of a 3'-untranslated region single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (35708 C>T) was significantly associated with lower DCK mRNA expression. This SNP was strongly linked with other intronic SNPs, forming a major haplotype block in both ethnic groups. In an exploratory analysis, the 35708C allele was also associated with lower blast ara-C-5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) levels in acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving ara-C as continuous infusion. These results suggest that genetic variation in DCK influences its activity and expression and may predict the variability observed in intracellular levels of the ara-C active metabolite ara-CTP.","['Lamba, Jatinder K', 'Crews, Kristine', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Schuetz, Erin G', 'Gresham, Jessica', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Ribeiro, Raul']","['Lamba JK', 'Crews K', 'Pounds S', 'Schuetz EG', 'Gresham J', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Rubnitz J', 'Ribeiro R']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale St., Memphis, TN 38105, USA. jatinder.lamba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070912,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', '*Pharmacogenetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/09/15 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.107.128595 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.107.128595 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2007 Dec;323(3):935-45. doi: 10.1124/jpet.107.128595.

Therefore, we conducted a matched controlled analysis on the outcome of OD in these recipients. METHODS: Between January 2000 and November 2005, 33 patients with a history of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy had an OD cycle. Matching was performed to the chronologically closest patient without a history of cancer therapy by number of days of hormonal stimulation before embryo replacement, number of replaced embryos, day of embryo transfer and origin of sperm. RESULTS: The primary diseases of the patients were Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 12), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 3), leukaemia (n = 7), ovarian cancer (n = 6), Ewing's sarcoma (n = 2), breast cancer (n = 1), sympathoblastoma (n = 1) and histiocytosis X (n = 1). Twenty-three patients had undergone chemotherapy and radiotherapy, nine patients chemotherapy only and one radiotherapy only. The mean age of the recipients was 33.1 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.9-35.3] and 39.6 (95% CI 37.1-42.1) in the study and control groups, respectively. The average number of received oocytes and transferred embryos, was similar in both groups. Nineteen (57.6%) versus 13 (39.4%) pregnancies resulting in an ongoing pregnancy (i.e. viable at 12 weeks) in 15 (45.4%) versus 9 cycles (27.3%) (NS) were obtained in study and control groups, respectively. Implantation rate in study and control groups was 35.8 versus 17.9%, respectively (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that patients with a history of cancer treatment have a pregnancy rate after OD similar to that in the general population of oocyte recipients.","['Vernaeve, Valerie', 'Bodri, Daniel', 'Colodron, Marta', 'Vidal, Ricard', 'Durban, Merce', 'Coll, Oriol']","['Vernaeve V', 'Bodri D', 'Colodron M', 'Vidal R', 'Durban M', 'Coll O']","['Clinica Eugin, Calle Entenza 293-295, 08029, Barcelona, Spain. vernaeve@telefonica.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070912,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Oocyte Donation/*methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Rate', '*Radiotherapy', 'Reproductive Medicine/methods', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic/*methods', 'Time Factors']",2007/09/15 09:00,2008/05/03 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['dem276 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/dem276 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2007 Nov;22(11):2863-7. doi: 10.1093/humrep/dem276.

In this regard, the oncogenic potential of the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein correlates with its binding capacity to the tumor suppressor hDlg. Recent results show that hDlg in T cells is associated to a network of scaffolding proteins including another PDZ domain-containing protein termed hScrib. Interestingly, previous studies have revealed complementary activities of both proteins in the control of epithelial cell polarity. Here, we demonstrate that Tax can bind to hScrib and that the resulting Tax/hScrib complex is present in human T cell leukemia virus type 1-infected T cells. By confocal microscopy, we show that Tax modifies the localization of hScrib in transfected COS cells as well as in infected T cell lines and targets hScrib to particular spots exhibiting a granular distribution, mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Given that Tax sequesters hScrib to these particular structures, we postulate that Tax might inhibit hScrib activity. Providing further support to this idea, we find that transient overexpression of hScrib attenuates T cell receptor-induced NFAT activity but that the presence of Tax counteracts this negative effect on the NFAT pathway. The fact that hDlg and hScrib are both targeted by Tax underlies their importance in T cell function.","['Arpin-Andre, Charlotte', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel']","['Arpin-Andre C', 'Mesnard JM']","[""Centre d'etudes d'agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologies pour la Sante, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique/UM 1/UM 2 UMR 5236/IFR 122, Institut de Biologie, 4 Boulevard Henri IV, Montpellier Cedex 2, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070911,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SCRIB protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'PDZ Domains', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/09/15 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)61322-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M702279200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Nov 9;282(45):33132-41. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M702279200.

The difficulty of isolating antigen-specific T lymphocytes for individual patients limits the more widespread use of adoptive T cell therapy. The demonstration that cloned T cell receptor (TCR) genes can be used to produce T lymphocyte populations of desired specificity offers new opportunities for antigen-specific T cell therapy. The first trial in humans demonstrated that TCR gene-modified T cells persisted for an extended time period and reduced tumor burden in some patients. The WT1 protein is an attractive target for immunotherapy of leukemia and solid cancer since elevated expression has been demonstrated in AML, CML, MDS and in breast, colon and ovarian cancer. In the past, we have isolated high avidity CTL specific for a WT1-derived peptide presented by HLA-A2 and cloned the TCR alpha and beta genes of a WT1-specific CTL line. The genes were inserted into retroviral vectors for transduction of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes of leukemia patients and normal donors. The treatment of leukemia-bearing NOD/SCID mice with T cells transduced with the WT1-specific TCR eliminated leukemia cells in the bone marrow of most mice, while treatment with T cells transduced with a TCR of irrelevant specificity did not diminish the leukemia burden. In order to improve the safety and efficacy of TCR gene therapy, we have developed lentiviral TCR gene transfer. In addition, we employed strategies to enhance TCR expression while avoiding TCR mis-pairing. It may be possible to generate dominant TCR constructs that can suppress the expression of the endogenous TCR on the surface of transduced T cells. The development of new TCR gene constructs holds great promise for the safe and effective delivery of TCR gene therapy for the treatment of malignancies.","['Stauss, Hans J', 'Thomas, Sharyn', 'Cesco-Gaspere, Michela', 'Hart, Daniel P', 'Xue, Shao-An', 'Holler, Angelika', 'King, Judy', 'Wright, Graham', 'Perro, Mario', 'Pospori, Constantina', 'Morris, Emma']","['Stauss HJ', 'Thomas S', 'Cesco-Gaspere M', 'Hart DP', 'Xue SA', 'Holler A', 'King J', 'Wright G', 'Perro M', 'Pospori C', 'Morris E']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Pathology, University College London, Hampstead Campus, Royal Free Hospital, Rowland Hill Street, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom. h.stauss@medsch.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20070912,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2007/09/15 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00136-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Jan-Feb;40(1):113-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.018.

Over-expression of either wild type or a mutant form of myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) in transgenic mouse skeletal muscle and in cultured cells resulted in aggregate formation.

However, histological examination of skeletal muscles of MLF1 transgenic mice revealed no pathological changes other than the aggregates, and RotaRod testing did not detect functional deficits. MLF1 has recently been identified as a protein that could neutralize the toxicity of intracellular protein aggregates in a Drosophila model of Huntington's disease (HD). We also demonstrate that MLF1 interacts with MRJ, a heat shock protein, which can independently neutralize the toxicity of intracellular protein aggregates in the Drosophila HD model. Our data suggest that over-expression of MLF1 has no significant impact on skeletal muscle function in mice; that progressive formation of protein aggregates in muscle are not necessarily pathogenic; and that MLF1 and MRJ may function together to ameliorate the toxic effects of polyglutamine or mutant proteins in myodegenerative diseases such as inclusion body myositis and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, as well as neurodegenerative disease.","['Li, Zhi-Fang', 'Wu, Xiaohua', 'Jiang, Yun', 'Liu, Jianxiang', 'Wu, Chun', 'Inagaki, Masaki', 'Izawa, Ichiro', 'Mizisin, Andrew P', 'Engvall, Eva', 'Shelton, G Diane']","['Li ZF', 'Wu X', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu J', 'Wu C', 'Inagaki M', 'Izawa I', 'Mizisin AP', 'Engvall E', 'Shelton GD']","['Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA 92037, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070912,Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNAJB6 protein, human)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoprotection/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/metabolism/pathology', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Muscle Weakness/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Muscular Diseases/*genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptides/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",2007/09/15 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-510X(07)00521-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jns.2007.07.027 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 2008 Jan 15;264(1-2):77-86. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2007.07.027.

Kinamycin F reacted with glutathione (GSH) in a complex series of reactions which suggested that kinamycin F may have its cytotoxicity modulated by GSH. Consistent with this idea, 2-oxo-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid treatment to increase cellular GSH levels and buthionine sulfoximine treatment to decrease GSH levels resulted in decreased and increased kinamycin F cytotoxicity, respectively, in K562 leukemia cells. Kinamycin F weakly bound to DNA and induced DNA damage in K562 cells that was independent of GSH levels. The GSH-promoted DNA nicking induced by kinamycin F in vitro was attenuated by deferoxamine, dimethyl sulfoxide, and catalase, which indicated that DNA damage initiated by this agent occurred in an iron-, hydrogen-peroxide-, and hydroxyl-radical-dependent manner. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments showed that the GSH/kinamycin F system produced a semiquinone free radical and that the hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase/kinamycin F system generated a phenoxyl free radical. In conclusion, the results indicated that kinamycin F cytotoxicity may be due to reductive and/or peroxidative activation to produce DNA-and protein-damaging species.","[""O'Hara, Kimberley A"", 'Wu, Xing', 'Patel, Daywin', 'Liang, Hong', 'Yalowich, Jack C', 'Chen, Nan', 'Goodfellow, Valerie', 'Adedayo, Otunola', 'Dmitrienko, Gary I', 'Hasinoff, Brian B']","[""O'Hara KA"", 'Wu X', 'Patel D', 'Liang H', 'Yalowich JC', 'Chen N', 'Goodfellow V', 'Adedayo O', 'Dmitrienko GI', 'Hasinoff BB']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, 50 Sifton Road, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3T 2N2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070713,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '2044-85-1 (diacetyldichlorofluorescein)', '50556-18-8 (kinamycin F)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)', 'ZF80H5GXUF (Amitrole)']",IM,"['Amitrole/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dithiothreitol/chemistry', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Glutathione/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Quinones/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2007/09/15 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(07)00467-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2007 Oct 15;43(8):1132-44. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.07.005.

Some specific aberrations vary in frequency among different geographical areas and ethnic groups. There are only limited studies on the role of such variability in AML patients. Here, we report the results of a cytogenetic study on 63 ethnic Omani patients with de novo AML: 18 children (<or=16 years) and 45 adults. By sex, 41 were male and 22 female; median age at diagnosis was 25 years. The morphological diagnosis was based on the French-American-British (FAB) WHO criteria. Chromosome abnormalities were present in 39 of 63 patients (62% overall, or 44% for adults and 18% for children). Karyotypes with a sole abnormality accounted for 20 of 63 patients (32%). Chromosome abnormalities were more common in patients with the FAB-M2 subtype (15 of 22; 68%), which was also the most frequent subtype observed (22 of 63; 35%). Among the normal karyotypes (24 of 63; 38%), M2 subtype was the also most frequent (7 of 24; 29%), followed by M4 (4 of 24; 17%). Balanced translocations, t(8;21) and t(15;17) were observed in 7 of 63 (11%) and 6 of 63 (10%), respectively. Inv(16) was seen in 2 of 63 (3%). Trisomy 8 was the most frequent numerical anomaly, found in 7 of 63 (11%). Monosomy 7 was seen in 3 of 63 (5%). The patterns in our study were similar to those reported from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, but the frequency of abnormalities varied.

Microarray analysis identified upregulation of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) to cell lines with acquired resistance to L-asp, and in the case of DNR, upregulation of ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1). Suppression of ABCB1, ASNS and ASS1 by RNA interference revealed their functional relevance to acquired drug resistance. Expression profiling of these genes in 80 T-ALL patients showed correlation with treatment response.

Acidity constants are determined by spectrophotometric titrations, as well as conditional stability constants for the resulting 1:1 complexes with trivalent lanthanide ions. The complexes have stabilities comparable to 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(carbamoylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (dtma) complexes, with pLn approximately 12-13. Photophysical properties of the ligand and of the EuL3 and TbL3 complexes have been determined for both microcrystalline samples and solutions in water and acetonitrile. They point to the metal ion being present in an environment with axial symmetry derived from the C4 point group. The hydration number determined for TbL3 decreases with increasing pH value and becomes fractional at pH 7.5, which points to an equilibrium between two differently solvated species and probably to the participation of the deprotonated carboxylic acid chain in the complexation. The quantum yields in water (1.9% for EuIII, 3.4% for TbIII) are smaller than those for complexes with the symmetrically substituted parent macrocycle, but efficient luminescence resonant energy transfer (LRET) was observed when Cy5 dye was added to the solutions. Finally, the influence of the TbL3 complex on cell viability is tested on both malignant (5D10 mouse hybridoma, Jurkat human T leukaemia, MCF-7 human breast carcinoma) and non-malignant (Hacat human keratinocyte) cell lines. Cell viability after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C with 500 microM TbL3 was >90% for all cell lines, except Jurkat (>70%).

However, most patients with CML receiving imatinib still harbour molecular residual disease and some develop resistance associated with ABL kinase domain mutations. The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis) and dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb) have shown significant activity after imatinib failure in clinical trials, but still face similar obstacles to imatinib, including negligible activity against the frequent BCR-ABL T315I mutation and modest effects in advanced phases of CML. Various medicinal chemistry efforts, in part aided by structural studies of the ABL kinase-imatinib complex have resulted in the synthesis of a new generation of BCR-ABL inhibitors, some of which have shown encouraging preliminary activity in clinical trials, including against T315I mutants. Here, we discuss these emerging therapies, which have the potential to improve the outcome of patients with CML.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas M.

PROCEDURE: Humoral and cellular immunity were evaluated in 72 children with ALL at the end of intensive therapy and values were compared to those at the completion of therapy and 6-monthly. Parameters investigated included lymphocyte subpopulation by flow cytometry, immunoglobulin levels by nephelometry, antibody titers to previous immunizations and delayed hypersensitivity with skin testing. Immune responses were correlated to duration of therapy, CNS radiotherapy, age and sex. RESULTS: Humoral immunity was severely depressed by the end of intensive therapy with low immunoglobulin levels and CD19, improved after therapy cessation. Cellular immune responses were normal at the end of intensive treatment but declined significantly by the end of therapy and both CD4 and CD8 remained low at later evaluation points whereas CD4/CD8 ratio was increasing. Duration of therapy and CNS radiotherapy did not affect the rate of immune recovery whereas female had higher CD19, CD45RO, and IgM and children >7 years had higher CD19 and lower CD16 and CD3DR. Among immunized children, 86.7% maintained protective antibodies to MMR and 63% to polio. Despite impairment of immunity, infections outside the neutropenic periods were common viral illnesses. CONCLUSION: Humoral immunity was depressed in children with ALL at the end of intensive therapy but began to recover after cessation of therapy. In contrast, cellular immunity declined significantly by the end of therapy and remained abnormal for at least 1 year post-therapy.","['Kosmidis, Sofia', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Bouhoutsou, Despina', 'Doganis, Dimitrios', 'Kallergi, Constantina', 'Douladiris, Nikolaos', 'Pourtsidis, Apostolos', 'Varvoutsi, Maria', 'Saxoni-Papageorgiou, Fotini', 'Vasilatou-Kosmidis, Helen']","['Kosmidis S', 'Baka M', 'Bouhoutsou D', 'Doganis D', 'Kallergi C', 'Douladiris N', 'Pourtsidis A', 'Varvoutsi M', 'Saxoni-Papageorgiou F', 'Vasilatou-Kosmidis H']","['Second Department of Radiotherapy of St. Savas Anticancer Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agammaglobulinemia/*chemically induced', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology/radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skin Tests', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21327 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Mar;50(3):528-32. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21327.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We set out to investigate whether lack of dendritic cells or der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11) deletions might be correlated with increased CD7 expression on CD34+ cells in CML. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We identified 43 patients in our cohort of CML patients in the first chronic phase in whom we were able to assess the expression of CD7 on CD34+ cells. der(9)t(9;22) deletions were evaluated by FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) analyses and the proportions of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: High and low expressions of CD7 on CD34+ cells were found in 19 and 24 patients, respectively. Two out of 20 patients examined had a der(9)t(9;22)(q34;11) deletion, one patient with high expression and one with low expression of CD7 on CD34+ cells. The proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) and myeloid dendritic cells (MDCs) were reduced in a majority of patients in our cohort, but no correlation was found between high or low expression of CD7 on CD34+ cells and the proportion of dendritic cells. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of CD34+CD7+ cells in patients with CML is not associated with der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11) deletions. Nor did we find any correlation between CD7 expression on CD34+ cells and lack of dendritic cells.

One major problem in this disease is the emergence of leukemic blast cells that are resistant to anticancer drugs. This phenomenon is termed multidrug resistance (MDR). One cause of MDR is the expression of the MDR1 gene and its product, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). AIM: In the present study, we tried to inhibit the MDR phenotype with MDR1/mRNA/Pgp in leukemic cells using different antisense sequences and two non-viral vectors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pgp expressing cell line was established from a parental K562 (Erythroleukemia) cell line with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin, and named KDI/20. In order to reverse the MDR phenotype due to Pgp expression, four different sequences of sense, antisense and one random sequence with phosphorothioate (PTO) modification (PS-ODN) against MDR1/mRNA were synthesized. They were used on the KDI/20 cells in combination with two non-viral vectors: (1) Fugene 6 transfection reagent (cationic lipid) and (2) polyethylenimine (cationic polymer). The effect of PS-ODN was assessed at the cellular level by flow cytometry (for Pgp detection), and Rhodamine 123 assay (for functional assessment of Pgp) at the molecular level by RT-PCR (for MDR1/mRNA detection) and MTT assay in order to assess the sensitivity of cell to doxorubicin. RESULTS: The results showed a decrease in the percentage of Pgp protein and MDR1/mRNA expression and an increase in the accumulation of Rh123 and drug sensitivity of cells to doxorubicin by antisense I and III. The reduction of MDR1/mRNA was more significant than its protein reduction. Therefore, our data showed that antisense can reverse the MDR phenotype at the transcription level and the PEI vector is more efficient than cationic lipid.","['Nadali, Fatemeh', 'Pourfathollah, Ali-Akbar', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Nikougoftar, Mahin', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Dizaji, Abdolkhlegh', 'Azizi, Ebrahim', 'Zomorodipour, Alireza', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Nadali F', 'Pourfathollah AA', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Nikougoftar M', 'Rostami S', 'Dizaji A', 'Azizi E', 'Zomorodipour A', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Department of laboratory Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran. nadali@med.mui.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/*drug effects', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['779527666 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701283991 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Oct;12(5):393-401. doi: 10.1080/10245330701283991.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuous exposure of cells to step-wise increasing concentrations of doxorubicin resulted in the selection of HL60/DOX cells, which expressed about 10.7-fold resistance as compared to parental sensitive cells. The expression analyses of MRP1 and MDR1 drug efflux proteins in doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant HL60 cells revealed that there was an upregulation of MRP1 gene in HL60/DOX cells as compared to parental sensitive cells. On the other hand, while there was no expression of MDR1 gene in parental cells, the expression of MDR1 gene was upregulated in HL60/DOX cells. HL60/DOX cells also showed cross-resistance to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-c). This resistance was reversed by a combination therapy of Ara-c and cyclosporine A.

As AEL is biologically an ""erythroid predominant"" disease, two ratios (PE/MB, PE/TEC) with proerythroblasts as numerator have been formulated. An attempt has been made to assess the difference in these ratios in subclassified AEL. There were 29 M6a, 2M6b,and 9 M6 c patients, which were subclassified using the criteria proposed by Mazzella et al.

Chemotherapy-induced anemia can be successfully treated using recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). AIM OF THE STUDY: To demonstrate the effectiveness of once-weekly (QW) rHuEPO dosing to effect improved hemoglobin levels, decreased transfusion use, and improved functional outcomes and QOL in pediatric leukemic patients (ALL) receiving maintenance chemotherapy. PATIENT AND METHODS: This was a prospective randomized, single-center, open-label, 12-week case-control study of epoetin alfa in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in remission receiving maintenance chemotherapy. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive either epoetin alfa (rHuEPO group = 30 cases, 17 males and 13 females, age; 6.8 +/- 2.33 years), or no epoetin alfa (control group = 30 cases, 16 males and 14 females, age; 6.76 +/- 2.28 years). Both groups were matched as regard age, sex, baseline Hb concentration, remission state, chemotherapy regimen, numbers and amount of blood transfusion, and leukemia state (both were low and standard risk). Epoetin alfa was administered at a dose of 450 IU/kg, once weekly, subcutaneously (s.c.) for 12 consecutive weeks. Endpoints were changes in hematologic and QOL parameters. RESULTS: Among the 30 patients evaluable for hematologic response, the mean increase in Hb from baseline to time of final evaluation was 3.08 +/- 1.48 g/dl (p < 0.001). An increase in Hb of > or = 2 g/dl, in the absence of blood transfusion, occurred in 70% of patients (21 of 30 patients) who were on the study for > or = 30 days. The overall response rate (Hb increase > or = 2 g/dl or Hb > or = 12 g/dl in the absence of blood transfusion) was 90% (27 of 30 patients). In 30 patients who were evaluable for QOL assessment, epoetin-alpha therapy was found to significantly (p < 0.001) improve mean cancer linear analog scale (CLAS) scores for energy level, ability to perform daily activity, and overall QOL from baseline to the time of final evaluation. QW epoetin-alpha was found to be well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Treatment with QW epoetin-alpha was found to increase Hb levels, decrease transfusion requirement, and improve functional status and QOL in anemic patients with ALL in maintenance receiving chemotherapy. The once-weekly schedule is convenient, safe, and may reduce the burden on patients, parents, and their caregivers by reducing the number of visits to the clinic.","['Abdelrazik, Nabil', 'Fouda, Manal']","['Abdelrazik N', 'Fouda M']","['Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and BMT unit, Department of Pediatrics, Mansoura University Children Hospital (MUCH), Mansoura, Egypt. nabeelabdelrazik2003@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '64FS3BFH5W (Epoetin Alfa)']",IM,"['Anemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Epoetin Alfa', 'Erythropoietin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['780591759 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701521572 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Dec;12(6):533-41. doi: 10.1080/10245330701521572.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bacteremia still causes significant mortality among neutropenic patients with cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for septic shock and for mortality in neutropenic patients with leukemia and bacteremia. Consecutive samples from 20 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and bacteremia were studied during a 1 year period (January-December 2003). All patients received empirical antibiotic therapies for febrile episodes using ceftazidime plus amikacin. About 110 neutropenic febrile episodes were noted: clinically documented 14.54%, microbiologically documented 16.36% and fever of unknown origin 69.09%. Gram-negative organism caused eight febrile episodes: Pseudomonas (5), Klebsiella (3). Gram-positive organism caused 10 episodes: Staphylococcus (6), Streptococci (2), Enterococci (2). Pulmonary infection accounted for 25% of clinically documented infections. About 14 of the 110 febrile episodes were associated with septic shock causing mortality in 7 patients. In a univariate analysis variables associated with septic shock were: pulmonary infection (OR = 17, p = 0.001), serum bicarbonate < 17 mmol/l (OR = 68, p < 0.001) and serum lactate >3 mmol/l (OR = 62, p < 0.001). Variables associated with mortality were: pulmonary infection (OR = 83, p < 0.001) and serum bicarbonate < 17 mmol/l (OR = 61, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis two variables were associated with septic shock: pulmonary infection (OR = 5, p = 0.043) and serum lactate >3 mmol/l (OR = 10, p = 0.003). An elevated serum lactate (>3 mmol/l) and low serum bicarbonate ( < 17 mmol/l) at the onset of bacteremia are useful biomarkers in predicting septic shock and mortality in neutropenic patients.","['Ramzi, Jeddi', 'Mohamed, Zarrouk', 'Yosr, Benabdennebi', 'Karima, Kacem', 'Raihane, Benlakhal', 'Lamia, Aissaoui', 'Hela, Ben Abid', 'Zaher, Belhadjali', 'Balkis, Meddeb']","['Ramzi J', 'Mohamed Z', 'Yosr B', 'Karima K', 'Raihane B', 'Lamia A', 'Hela BA', 'Zaher B', 'Balkis M']","['Department of Hematology Place du gouvernement la Kasbah, Aziza Othmana University Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. ramzi.jed@voila.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Bicarbonates)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Bicarbonates/blood', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Shock, Septic/*diagnosis/mortality']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['779526036 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701384237 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Dec;12(6):543-8. doi: 10.1080/10245330701384237.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses to therapy, the emergence of resistance to imatinib has been recognized as a major problem in the treatment of patients with CML. Various cellular mechanisms may be involved in the nature of cellular resistance. Increased amount of target, alteration in structure of target proteins, decreased drug uptake and increased detoxification are well-known mechanisms of resistance. On the other hand, in some cases, even if anticancer drugs reach their sites of action, bypassing drug efflux system of the cells, some cells still may survive via the dysregulation of apoptotic signalling. In this study, mechanisms of resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis in human Meg-01 CML cells were examined. Continuous exposure of cells to step-wise increasing concentrations of imatinib resulted in the selection of 200- and 1000 nM imatinib-resistant sub-lines referred to as Meg-01/IMA-0,2 and Meg-01/IMA-1, respectively. MTT cell proliferation, cell cycle analyses and trypan blue dye exclusion analyses showed that Meg-01/IMA-1 cells were resistant to imatinib-induced apoptosis as compared to parental sensitive cells. There was an increased expression of BCR/ABL, Bcl-2 and an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) detected in resistant cells comparing to parental sensitive cells. There was no mutation detected in imatinib binding site of ABL kinase region. Various diverse mechanisms have been reported for their involvement in the multidrug resistance. In this study, it has been shown that the degree of BCR/ABL expression appears to be directly proportional to the levels of imatinib resistance. In addition, there have been BCR/ABL-independent mechanisms reported for deriving resistance against imatinib. Our results revealed that besides BCR/ABL overexpression, imatinib resistance also depends on the inhibition of apoptosis as a result of up-regulation of anti-apoptotic stimuli and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic stimuli through MMP but does not depend on any mutation on imatinib binding site of ABL kinase.","['Baran, Yusuf', 'Ural, Ali Ugur', 'Gunduz, Ufuk']","['Baran Y', 'Ural AU', 'Gunduz U']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey. yusufbaran@iyte.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['779749476 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701384179 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Dec;12(6):497-503. doi: 10.1080/10245330701384179.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha is still rather limited. The mechanisms responsible for the beneficial action of IFN-alpha in HCL patients are unclear. A continuous line of cells (Eskol) from a patient diagnosed with HCL was established and shown to have several properties of HCL. Even though, Eskol cells are very resistant to anti-proliferative activity of IFN-alpha, Daudi cells, another human B-cell-derived cell line, are very sensitive to anti-proliferative activity of IFN-alpha and are commonly used as a model cell to test anti-proliferative effect of IFN-alpha. To understand the molecular reason(s) behind the observed obvious differences to IFN sensitivity of above cells, we have analyzed the expression levels of BCL2, caspase-1, Laminin and PARP in these cells. We found that Daudi cells do not express BCL2 at all, and probably because of that, these cells have constantly cleaved, and probably activated form of caspase-1.

The R peptide cleavage during virion maturation activates its fusogenicity and is required for viral entry. We analyzed fusogenicity and transduction efficiency of mutant Env proteins of ecotropic, amphotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MLVs. As the result, we found that the hydrophobic amino acid residues around the R peptide cleavage site are important for membrane fusion inhibition by the R peptide. In addition, we found that Env complexes with R peptide-truncated and -containing Env proteins have lower fusogenicity and transduction efficiency than those with the R-peptide-truncated Env alone, suggesting that efficient R peptide cleavage is required for efficient MLV vector transduction. The role of R peptide cleavage in amphotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MLV infection has not been investigated. We found in this study that the R peptide cleavage is required for amphotropic, xenotropic, and polytropic MLV vector transduction, like with ecotropic MLV. The R-peptide-truncated Env proteins of the xenotropic and polytropic MLVs, however, had much lower fusogenicity than those of the ecotropic and amphotropic MLVs.

Recently, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) were reported to display elevated beta-catenin-dependent nuclear signaling. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin has been shown to promote its nuclear localization. Here, we examined the causal relationship between FLT3 activity and beta-catenin nuclear localization. Compared to cells with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), cells with the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain mutation (FLT3-TKD) had elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated beta-catenin. Although beta-catenin was localized mainly in the cytoplasm in FLT3-WT cells, it was primarily nuclear in FLT3-ITD cells. Treatment with FLT3 kinase inhibitors or FLT3 silencing with RNAi decreased beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization. Conversely, treatment of FLT3-WT cells with FLT3 ligand increased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Endogenous beta-catenin co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous activated FLT3, and recombinant activated FLT3 directly phosphorylated recombinant beta-catenin. Finally, FLT3 inhibitor decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin in leukemia cells obtained from FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. These data demonstrate that FLT3 activation induces beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization, and thus suggest a mechanism for the association of FLT3 activation and beta-catenin oncogeneic signaling in AML.","['Kajiguchi, T', 'Chung, E J', 'Lee, S', 'Stine, A', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Naoe, T', 'Levis, M J', 'Neckers, L', 'Trepel, J B']","['Kajiguchi T', 'Chung EJ', 'Lee S', 'Stine A', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T', 'Levis MJ', 'Neckers L', 'Trepel JB']","['Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. tomokaji@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070913,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '146535-11-7 (6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology']",2007/09/14 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404923 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404923 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2476-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404923.

We used a murine bone marrow transplant model to assess cooperation between MLL translocation and FLT3 activation. We demonstrate that MLL-AF9 expression induces acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in approximately 70 days, whereas the combination of MLL-AF9 and FLT3-ITD does so in less than 30 days. Secondary transplantation of splenic cells from diseased mice established that leukemia stem cells are present at a very high frequency of approximately 1:100 in both diseases. Importantly, prospectively isolated granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) coinfected with MLL-AF9 and FLT3-ITD give rise to a similar AML, with shorter latency than from GMP transduced with MLL-AF9 alone. Cooperation between MLL-AF9 and FLT3-ITD was further verified by real-time assessment of leukemogenesis using noninvasive bioluminescence imaging. We used this model to demonstrate that MLL-AF9/FLT3-ITD-induced leukemias are sensitive to FLT3 inhibition in a 2-3 week in vivo assay. These data show that activated FLT3 cooperates with MLL-AF9 to accelerate onset of an AML from whole bone marrow as well as a committed hematopoietic progenitor, and provide a new genetically defined model system that should prove useful for rapid assessment of potential therapeutics in vivo.","['Stubbs, M C', 'Kim, Y M', 'Krivtsov, A V', 'Wright, R D', 'Feng, Z', 'Agarwal, J', 'Kung, A L', 'Armstrong, S A']","['Stubbs MC', 'Kim YM', 'Krivtsov AV', 'Wright RD', 'Feng Z', 'Agarwal J', 'Kung AL', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070913,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404951 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404951 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jan;22(1):66-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404951.

Gene expression data contain high level of noise and the overwhelming number of genes relative to the number of available samples. It brings out a great challenge for machine learning and statistic techniques. Support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully used to classify gene expression data of cancer tissue. In the medical field, it is crucial to deliver the user a transparent decision process. How to explain the computed solutions and present the extracted knowledge becomes a main obstacle for SVM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) scheme, consisting of feature selection, rule extraction and prediction modeling is proposed to improve the explanation capacity of SVM. In this scheme, we show that the feature selection problem can be translated into an ordinary multiple parameters learning problem. And a shrinkage approach: 1-norm based linear programming is proposed to obtain the sparse parameters and the corresponding selected features. We propose a novel rule extraction approach using the information provided by the separating hyperplane and support vectors to improve the generalization capacity and comprehensibility of rules and reduce the computational complexity. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Two public gene expression datasets: leukemia dataset and colon tumor dataset are used to demonstrate the performance of this approach. Using the small number of selected genes, MK-SVM achieves encouraging classification accuracy: more than 90% for both two datasets. Moreover, very simple rules with linguist labels are extracted. The rule sets have high diagnostic power because of their good classification performance.","['Chen, Zhenyu', 'Li, Jianping', 'Wei, Liwei']","['Chen Z', 'Li J', 'Wei L']","['Institute of Policy & Management, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China. zychen@casipm.ac.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070911,Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Carcinoma/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/methods', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Software Validation']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0933-3657(07)00097-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.artmed.2007.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 2007 Oct;41(2):161-75. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2007.07.008.

In this report, we discuss a CLL patient with leptomeningeal involvement, who presented with neurological symptoms as the first clinical sign, and a diagnosis of leptomeningeal was made based on CSF cytology and flow cytometry. Treatment consisted of radiation therapy and intrathecal chemotherapy with arabinoside-cytosine and systemic chemotherapy. On the basis of this patient-report together with 37 other previously reported cases, the clinical characteristics together with treatment options and outcome of leptomeningeal involvement in CLL are reviewed.

A survey among physicians and medical students.,182-8,"Surveys have shown that the prestige of medical specialities is ordered hierarchically. We investigate whether similar tacit agreement in the medical community also applies to diseases, since such rankings can affect priority settings in medical practice. A cross-sectional survey was performed in three samples of physicians and medical students in Norway in 2002. A questionnaire was sent to 305 senior doctors (response rate, 79%), 500 general practitioners (response rate, 65%) and 490 final-year medical students (response rate, 64%). Outcome measures were ratings on a 1-9 scale of the prestige these respondents believed most health personnel would accord to a sample set of 38 different diseases as well as 23 medical specialities. Both diseases and specialities were clearly and consistently ranked according to prestige. Myocardial infarction, leukaemia and brain tumour were among the highest ranked, and fibromyalgia and anxiety neurosis were among the lowest. Among specialities, neurosurgery and thoracic surgery were accorded the highest rank, and geriatrics and dermatovenerology the lowest. Our interpretation of the data is that diseases and specialities associated with technologically sophisticated, immediate and invasive procedures in vital organs located in the upper parts of the body are given high prestige scores, especially where the typical patient is young or middle-aged. At the other end, low prestige scores are given to diseases and specialities associated with chronic conditions located in the lower parts of the body or having no specific bodily location, with less visible treatment procedures, and with elderly patients.","['Album, Dag', 'Westin, Steinar']","['Album D', 'Westin S']","['University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. dag.album@sosiologi.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070912,England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,,IM,"['Adult', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Attitude to Health', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease/*classification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medicine', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway', 'Physicians', 'Prejudice', '*Social Class', 'Specialization', 'Students, Medical']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0277-9536(07)00392-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 2008 Jan;66(1):182-8. doi: 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.07.003.

RESULTS: No significant difference in the proportion of patients with complications was observed between the two protocols over the 3 weeks. Complications were more frequent immediately after administration of the chemotherapeutic agents, with a gradual decline over the following 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Oral complications occur in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia irrespective of the chemotherapy protocol used for treatment, with a higher frequency being observed in the first week after the beginning of antineoplastic therapy.","['de Oliveira Lula, Estevam Carlos', 'de Oliveira Lula, Carlos Estevam', 'Alves, Claudia Maria Coelho', 'Lopes, Fernanda Ferreira', 'Pereira, Antonio Luiz Amaral']","['de Oliveira Lula EC', 'de Oliveira Lula CE', 'Alves CM', 'Lopes FF', 'Pereira AL']","['Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Maranhao, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil. estevamcarloslula@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070911,Ireland,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,8003603,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Candidiasis/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gingival Hemorrhage/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mouth Mucosa/*drug effects', 'Oral Ulcer/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Xerostomia/*chemically induced/epidemiology']",2007/09/14 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/09/14 09:00'],"['2007/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-5876(07)00320-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijporl.2007.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2007 Nov;71(11):1681-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2007.07.006.

The purpose of this study was to determine the cytotoxic effects of karenitecin and mafosfamide in vitro against leukemia, medulloblastoma, and neuroblastoma cell lines. PROCEDURE: A modified methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the cells to karenitecin and mafosfamide. Cells were exposed to drug for 72 hr, after which the number of surviving cells was quantitated. For drug combination experiments, cells were exposed to medium alone (controls), single drugs alone (mafosfamide only, karenitecin only) or to different concentrations of the combination of the two drugs (karenitecin + mafosfamide), for a total of 36 concentration pairs per plate. The universal response surface approach (URSA) was used to analyze the cytotoxic effects of the combination of karenitecin and mafosfamide. RESULTS: The IC(50)s of karenitecin and mafosfamide for the various cell lines were similar. For both drugs nearly complete inhibition of cell growth was demonstrated at higher concentrations in all cell lines. In the neuroblastoma cell lines (SK-N-DZ; SK-N-SH) and the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, the combination of karenitecin and mafosfamide were synergistic. In the D283 medulloblastoma and both the leukemia cell lines (JM1 and Molt-4), the drug interaction was additive. Antagonism was not seen in any cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Karenitecin and mafosfamide are additive or synergistic in vitro against tumor types that disseminate to the leptomeninges. These results provide guidance for the choice of potential combination intrathecal regimens.","['Jacob, Eufemia', 'Scorsone, Kathy', 'Blaney, Susan M', ""D'Argenio, David Z"", 'Berg, Stacey L']","['Jacob E', 'Scorsone K', 'Blaney SM', ""D'Argenio DZ"", 'Berg SL']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA. ejacob@sonnet.ucla.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['24R60NVC41 (cositecan)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Medulloblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy']",2007/09/13 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/09/13 09:00'],"['2007/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21330 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):757-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21330.,,,PMC2975705,,"['P41 EB001978/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'P41-EB001978/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA090433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB001978-24/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB001978-245377/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', '1K23NR9192-01/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', '5K12CA90433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 NR009192/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS233694'],"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

There is mixed evidence for associations between reproductive history or infertility and acute leukemia among children without DS. METHODS: The authors conducted a case-control study of acute leukemia among children with DS to investigate possible risk factors in this population. From 1997 to 2002, 158 children aged <20 years with DS who had a diagnosis of acute leukemia (97 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] and 61 children with acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) were enrolled at Children's Oncology Group (COG) institutions. Controls with DS (n = 173) were selected from the cases' primary care clinic and frequency matched to cases on age. Telephone interviews were conducted with mothers of cases and controls assessing reproductive history, infertility, and infertility treatment. RESULTS: Null results were observed overall and by subtype for reproductive factors, including previous pregnancy outcomes and contraceptive use, and for most infertility outcomes. There was an increased risk of AML among children with DS whose parents had ever tried for >/=1 year to become pregnant (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.14-4.33). A 1-year increase in maternal age also was associated with AML (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Although the questionnaire was limited in this area, the results suggested that the risk for AML may be raised in children with DS because of infertility. In that the risk of infertility, along with having a child with DS, increase with age, these results warrant more research.","['Puumala, Susan E', 'Ross, Julie A', 'Olshan, Andrew F', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Puumala SE', 'Ross JA', 'Olshan AF', 'Robison LL', 'Smith FO', 'Spector LG']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Fertility Agents, Female)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/adverse effects', 'Fertilization in Vitro/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infertility/*therapy', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Mothers', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', '*Reproductive History', 'Risk Factors', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic/adverse effects']",2007/09/13 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/09/13 09:00'],"['2007/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23025 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):2067-74. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with BCR-ABL-negative MPDs were treated with PEG-IFN-alpha-2b, given subcutaneously weekly, at the starting dose of 3 microg/kg/wk for the first 14 patients and then 2 microg/kg/wk for the next 24 patients, with intent to treat patients as long as they benefited from the therapy. RESULTS: Median age was 54 years. Patient diagnoses were: 13 (34%) ET; 11 (29%) primary myelofibrosis (PMF); 5 (13%) BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); 4 (10.5%) hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES); 4 (10.5%) PV; and 1 (3%) unclassified myeloproliferative disease (uMPD). Recorded grade 3-4 toxicities were related to fatigue, myelosuppression, and musculoskeletal pain. Ten (26%) patients stopped treatment because of toxicity. Thirteen (34%) patients achieved a complete remission, and 4 (11%) achieved a partial response. Only 1 patient with PMF responded. Median time to response was 5 months. Median duration of response was 20 months. Three patients had a sustained response for >24 months. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-IFN-alpha-2b, with proper dose modifications, is effective in controlling disease in a significant proportion of BCR-ABL-negative MPD patients, particularly ET and PV. However, toxicities encountered with PEG-IFN-alpha-2b therapy are similar to those obtained with conventional IFN-alpha, thus limiting the duration of therapy.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Richie, Mary Ann', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Giles, Francis', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas D', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Faderl S', 'Richie MA', 'Beran M', 'Giles F', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Notch is known to interact with Ras and PTEN/PI3K (phosphoinositide-3 kinase)/Akt pathways. We investigated the interaction of Notch with these pathways and the possible reciprocal regulation of these signalling systems in T-ALL cells in vitro. Our analyses indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively active in the four T-ALL cell lines tested. Akt phosphorylation was not altered by the sequestration of growth factors, that is, Akt activation seems to be less dependent on but not completely independent of growth factors, possibly being not subject to negative feedback regulation. PTEN expression was not detected in 3/4 cell lines tested, suggesting the loss of PTEN-mediated Akt activation. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway arrests growth and enhances apoptosis, but with no modulation of expression of Bax-alpha and Bcl-2 proteins. We analysed the relationship between Notch-1 and the PI3K/Akt signalling and show that inhibition of the Akt pathway changes Notch expression; Notch-1 protein decreased in all the cell lines upon treatment with the inhibitor. Our studies strongly suggest that Notch signalling interacts with PI3K/Akt signalling and further that this occurs in the absence of PTEN expression. The consequences of this to the signalling outcome are yet unclear, but we have uncovered a significant inverse relationship between Notch and PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads us to postulate the operation of a reciprocal regulatory loop between Notch and Ras-PI3K/Akt in the pathogenesis of T-ALL.","['Calzavara, Elisabetta', 'Chiaramonte, Raffaella', 'Cesana, Daniela', 'Basile, Andrea', 'Sherbet, Gajanan V', 'Comi, Paola']","['Calzavara E', 'Chiaramonte R', 'Cesana D', 'Basile A', 'Sherbet GV', 'Comi P']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, University of Milano, LITA, via Fratelli Cevi 93, 20090 Segrate (MI), Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/09/13 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/09/13 09:00'],"['2007/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21527 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Apr 1;103(5):1405-12. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21527.,,,,,,,"['2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-six patients (13 [50%] with Abl kinase domain mutations) were treated. The initial dose level was tipifarnib at a dose of 300 mg twice daily and imatinib at a dose of 300 mg daily. Therapy was escalated following a '3 + 3' phase 1 design and the maximum tolerated dose was defined as tipifarnib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily and imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily. Therapy was administered for a median of 26 weeks (range, 3-150 weeks). RESULTS: Adverse events included diarrhea in 21 patients (81%) and nausea in 18 patients (69%), but were generally grade 2 or less (using the revised National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria). Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 11 patients (42%) and 8 patients (31%), respectively. Sixteen patients discontinued therapy (5 due to toxicity and 11 due to lack of response or disease progression). Hematologic responses were attained by 17 (68%) of 25 assessable patients. Nine patients (36%) also achieved a cytogenetic response (3 complete responses, 4 partial responses, and 2 minimal responses), including 4 patients harboring mutant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases. One patient bearing the highly imatinib-resistant T315I mutant achieved a partial cytogenetic response. The median response duration was 3 months (range, 2-30+ months). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tipifarnib and imatinib is well tolerated and has activity against several Abl kinase domain mutants. Combinations of tipifarnib with more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors warrant further investigation.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jones, Dan', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ebarb, Theresa', 'Giles, Francis', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Garcia-Manero G', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jones D', 'Faderl S', 'Ebarb T', 'Giles F', 'Thomas D', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

YC-1 induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in viability and apoptosis in YC-1-treated U937 cells. YC-1-induced apoptosis is a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-independent pathway. Proteomic analysis showed that the altered proteins include the significant regulation of HSP70, chaperonin, ATP synthase beta chains, and Chain F. Western blotting and immuno-cytochemistry stain showed that YC-1 treatment caused a time-dependent increase in cytosolic Cytochrome c, pro-caspase-9, Apaf-1, and the activation of caspase-9 and -3. Importantly, the in vivo antileukemia effects of YC-1 were evaluated in BALB/c mice inoculated with WEHI-3B orthotopic model. YC-1 enhanced survival rate and prevented the body weight loss in leukemia mice. The enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes were reduced in YC-1 treated than that in leukemia mice. H-E stain of spleen sections revealed that infiltration of immature myeloblastic cells into red pulp was reduced in YC-1-treated group. The apoptotic cells of splenocyte were significantly increased in YC-1 treated than that in leukemia mice by Tdt-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Taken together, we conclude that YC-1 acted against U937 cells in vitro via a mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway, and in orthotopic leukemia model, YC-1 administered antileukemia activity.","['Chung, Jing-Gung', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Huang, Li-Jiau', 'Lee, Fang-Yu', 'Teng, Che-Ming', 'Tsai, Sheng-Chung', 'Lin, Kuei-Li', 'Wang, Shu-Fang', 'Kuo, Sheng-Chu']","['Chung JG', 'Yang JS', 'Huang LJ', 'Lee FY', 'Teng CM', 'Tsai SC', 'Lin KL', 'Wang SF', 'Kuo SC']","['Departments of Microbiology, School of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Indazoles)', ""154453-18-6 (3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'U937 Cells']",2007/09/13 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/09/13 09:00'],"['2007/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200700200 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2007 Sep;7(18):3305-17. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200700200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the kinetics of mature CEC, both resting (rCEC) and activated (aCEC), as well as progenitor (CEPC) and apoptotic CEC (CEC(AnnV+)) in AML patients treated with standard chemotherapy and their influence on response to treatment and overall survival. We found significantly higher numbers of aCEC, rCEC, CEPC, and CEC(AnnV+) in AML patients than in healthy controls. The elevated CEPC and absolute blood counts in peripheral blood as well as the low CEC(AnnV+) number were associated with higher probability of induction treatment failure. aCEC, rCEC, CEPC, and CEC(AnnV+) counts determined in complete remission (CR) were significantly lower than those found at diagnosis. In those CR patients, a significant decrease in the CEC count and increase in the number of CEC(AnnV+) were observed already 24h after the first dose of chemotherapy. In refractory AML, the aCEC, rCEC, CEPC, and CEC(AnnV+) counts assessed before and after induction chemotherapy did not differ significantly, and a significant decrease in CEC count and increase in CEC(AnnV+) number were noted only after the last dose of chemotherapy. The number of CEC is significantly higher in AML patients than in healthy subjects and correlates with response to treatment. The evaluation of CEC kinetics and apoptotic profile may be a promising tool to select AML patients with poor response to chemotherapy who may benefit from antiangiogenic therapies.","['Wierzbowska, Agnieszka', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Krawczynska, Anna', 'Pluta, Agnieszka', 'Wrzesien-Kus, Agata', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Robak, Ewa', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Wierzbowska A', 'Robak T', 'Krawczynska A', 'Pluta A', 'Wrzesien-Kus A', 'Cebula B', 'Robak E', 'Smolewski P']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Ul.

We have developed a new approach to detect hybrid breakpoint cluster region and Abelson proto-oncogene (BCR-ABL) transcripts inside suspension cells using in situ RT-PCR and light upon extension (LUX) primer, followed by rapid quantitative analysis with flow cytometry. After cellular permeabilization and fixation of single cell suspension, the neoplastic mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR with LUX primer. The results demonstrated that a strong positive yellow-green signal was observed in 99-100% cells of K562 cell line, only the red nucleus was detected in NB4 cell line and normal controls. The technique has been utilised to study 12 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, and the results were compared with those of BCR-ABL fusion mRNA by RT-PCR and BCR-ABL fusion gene of the interphase cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the five diagnosed patients, 90-98% cells were strongly positive. Four patients, including three patients treated with interferon-alpha and hydroxyurea and one patient treated with imatinib mesylate, had 26-82.5% positive cells. Three patients treated with imatinib mesylate were negative. The in situ RT-PCR results demonstrated complete concordance with the results of I-FISH and RT-PCR. A fluorescence signal was detectable at 1/10(4) cells and became negative below this threshold with flow cytometry.

METHODS: Patient one was a 79-year-old man with history of prostate cancer and three previous operative left CSDH evacuations, each complicated by coagulopathic bleeding, who presented with new-onset left EDH. Patient two was a 27-year-old woman with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia with bilateral CSDH and mass effect on MRI. Neither patient had hemophilia, and preoperative INR was 1.2 in each case. Both patients underwent evacuation in the operating room, preceded by rFVIIa administration. RESULTS: Patient one underwent removal of his previous craniotomy flap followed by EDH evacuation. In patient two, coagulopathic bleeding upon surgical approach necessitated an additional dose of rFVIIa. Burrhole evacuation was well-tolerated with visible brain re-expansion following irrigation. Each case occurred with minimal blood loss and relatively easy hemostasis, with postoperative CT and clinical course revealing adequate evacuation. Neither patient experienced thromboembolic complications or required re-operation. CONCLUSION: These two patients are the first to be examined for the use of rFVIIa for reversal of clinical coagulopathy in the setting of normal INR. Our experience suggests that normal INR should not be a deterrent for patients to receive rFVIIa in the setting of strong neurosurgical suspicion for underlying clinical coagulopathy.","['McClelland, Shearwood 3rd', 'Won, Eun Kyung', 'Lam, Cornelius H']","['McClelland S 3rd', 'Won EK', 'Lam CH']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Minnesota, Mayo Mail Code 96, 420 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mccl0285@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Neurocrit Care,Neurocritical care,101156086,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/drug therapy/etiology', 'Craniotomy', 'Factor VIIa/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematoma, Epidural, Cranial/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Hematoma, Subdural, Chronic/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Humans', 'International Normalized Ratio', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2007/09/12 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/09/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12028-007-0040-x [doi]'],ppublish,Neurocrit Care. 2007;7(2):136-9. doi: 10.1007/s12028-007-0040-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TCL1 and MTCP1 proteins directly interact with AKT and modulate the AKT signal-transduction pathway, but the relevance of this mechanism in leukemogenesis remains unclear. We investigate the biologic functions of TCL1 in the T-cell lineage using various cell lines, and primary malignant and normal lymphocytes. In the Jurkat cell line, expression of TCL1 had no effect in unstimulated cells, whereas it abrogated activation-induced cell death (AICD). These cellular effects were concomitant with a major inhibition by TCL1 of PKCtheta and ERK pathways. Secondly, the TCL1-driven T-cell leukemia cell line SUP-T11 was shown to have impaired PKCtheta and ERK phosphorylation upon stimulation, which were restored by TCL1 inhibition using RNA interference. Finally, defects in these pathways were also observed in primary malignant (T-PLL) and transduced normal T lymphocytes expressing TCL1. Altogether, our data demonstrated that TCL1 inhibits AICD in T cells by blocking PKCtheta and ERK activation, upon cellular activation.","['Despouy, Gilles', 'Joiner, Marjorie', 'Le Toriellec, Emilie', 'Weil, Robert', 'Stern, Marc Henri']","['Despouy G', 'Joiner M', 'Le Toriellec E', 'Weil R', 'Stern MH']","['Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070910,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MTCP1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/09/12 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/09/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52890-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-11-059501 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Dec 15;110(13):4406-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-059501.

OBJECTIVE: To report the long term effectiveness and safety of mitoxantrone as induction therapy in patients with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS, and to assess treatment response factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 100 consecutive patients with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS received mitoxantrone 20 mg monthly combined with methylprednisolone 1 g for 6 months. Relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and drug safety were assessed every 6 months for up to at least 5 years. Within 6 months after induction, 73 patients received maintenance therapy (mitoxantrone every 3 months (n = 21); interferon beta (n = 25); azathioprine (n = 15); methotrexate (n = 7); glatiramer acetate (n = 5)). RESULTS: During the 12 months following initiation of mitoxantrone, the annual relapse rate (ARR) was reduced by 91%, 78% of patients remained relapse free, MRI activity was reduced by 89%, the mean EDSS decreased by 1.2 points (p<10(-6)) and 64% of patients improved by 1 point or more on the EDSS. In the longer term, the ARR reduction was sustained (0.29-0.42 for up to 5 years), the median time to the first relapse was 2.8 years and disability remained improved after 5 years. Younger age and lower EDSS score at the start of mitoxantrone treatment were predictive of better treatment response. Three patients presented with an asymptomatic decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction to less than 50% (one reversible). One patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (remission 5 years after diagnosis). CONCLUSION: Mitoxantrone monthly for 6 months as induction therapy followed by maintenance treatment showed sustained clinical benefit for up to 5 years with an acceptable adverse events profile in patients with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS.","['Le Page, Emmanuelle', 'Leray, Emmanuelle', 'Taurin, Gregory', 'Coustans, Marc', 'Chaperon, Jacques', 'Morrissey, Sean P', 'Edan, Gilles']","['Le Page E', 'Leray E', 'Taurin G', 'Coustans M', 'Chaperon J', 'Morrissey SP', 'Edan G']","['Service de Neurologie, Hopital Pontchaillou, rue Henri Le Guilloux, 35 033 Rennes Cedex, France. emmanuelle.lepage@chu-rennes.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20070910,England,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2985191R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '5M691HL4BO (Glatiramer Acetate)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Azathioprine/therapeutic use', 'Brain/pathology', 'Demography', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glatiramer Acetate', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-beta/therapeutic use', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Observation', 'Peptides/therapeutic use', 'Prevalence', 'Recurrence']",2007/09/12 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/09/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['jnnp.2007.124958 [pii]', '10.1136/jnnp.2007.124958 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2008 Jan;79(1):52-6. doi: 10.1136/jnnp.2007.124958.

An exploratory study using hospital records.,487-92,"We investigated the frequency and characteristics of patients with haematological malignancies (HMs) who were, or were not, referred for specialist palliative care (SPC). Data were abstracted from hospital records of 108 patients who died - 27 with leukaemia, 11 with myelodysplastic syndromes, 48 with lymphoma and 22 with myeloma. Ninety-three patients (86.1%) were >60 years of age at diagnosis, with 33 (30.6%) being >or=80 years and 31 (28.7%) having existing comorbidities. Thirty-three patients (30.6%) were referred to SPC services. There was little difference by age or HM diagnosis in referred patients. Seventeen of 67 patients (25.4%) dying on a hospital ward received SPC compared with 6/7 (85.7%) dying at home. Time between diagnosis and death influenced the referral - 24/52 patients (46.2%) dying >or=30 days after diagnosis received SPC compared with 8/42 (19.1%) dying within 30 days. In 14 patients, HM diagnosis was confirmed after death. Identification of these 14 patients is likely to be a unique feature of our study, as patients were selected from a regional, population-based register with centralized diagnostic services, enabling the identification of all patients with HM.

Cytological examination revealed Malassezia spp. overgrowth with/without bacterial infection in facial skin (n = 11), ventral neck (n = 6), abdomen (n = 6), ear canal (n = 4), chin (n = 2), ear pinnae (n = 2), interdigital (n = 1) and claw folds skin (n = 1). Moreover, in two cats Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated in fungal cultures from lesional skin. Azoles therapy alone was prescribed in seven, azoles and antibacterial therapy in eight and azoles with both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapy in three of the cats. After 3-4 weeks of treatment, substantial reduction of pruritus and skin lesions was observed in all 11 cats treated with a combined therapy and in five of seven treated solely with azoles. Malassezia spp. overgrowth may represent a secondary cutaneous problem in allergic cats particularly in those presented for dermatological examination displaying greasy adherent brownish scales. The favourable response to treatment with antifungal treatments alone suggests that, as in dogs, Malassezia spp. may be partly responsible for both pruritus and cutaneous lesions in allergic cats.","['Ordeix, Laura', 'Galeotti, Franca', 'Scarampella, Fabia', 'Dedola, Carla', 'Bardagi, Mar', 'Romano, Erica', 'Fondati, Alessandra']","['Ordeix L', 'Galeotti F', 'Scarampella F', 'Dedola C', 'Bardagi M', 'Romano E', 'Fondati A']","['Studio Dermatologico Veterinario, Milano, Italy. laura.ordeix@dermvet.fastwebnet.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Vet Dermatol,Veterinary dermatology,9426187,,IM,"['Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cat Diseases/*microbiology/pathology', 'Cats', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/complications/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Dermatomycoses/complications/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Malassezia/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Records/veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/09/12 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/09/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['VDE609 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00609.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Dermatol. 2007 Oct;18(5):316-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00609.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In France, incidence rates were stable over the 15 last years with around 1500 cases each year. A very small fraction of cases is attributable to known risk factors, including heritable cancers or cancers in children with heritable predisposing diseases, cancers induced by high doses of ionizing radiation of medical or accidental origin, by chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs. Responsibility of Epstein Barr virus in a fraction of Hodgkin's and Burkitt's lymphomas is also established, even though little is still known on the cofactors involved in industrial countries. Other virus could cause leukaemia, as suggested by localized increases in incidence in various conditions of population mixing. Conversely, there is some evidence that early common infections could be protective toward leukaemia risk, probably through their contribution to the maturation of the immune system. Several agents are suspected to induce chemical cancers, particularly pesticides, which are consistently reported in childhood leukaemia and brain tumours.

In this study, adrenal function and signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were prospectively assessed in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after induction treatment including high-dose prednisone (PDN) or dexamethasone (DXM). PROCEDURES: Sixty-four children with ALL, treated according to the AIEOP ALL 2000 Study protocol, underwent low dose ACTH (LD-ACTH) stimulation 24 hr after the last tapered steroid dose. In those with impaired cortisol response, additional LD ACTH tests were performed every 1-2 weeks until cortisol levels normalized. Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were recorded during the observation period. RESULTS: All patients had normal basal cortisol values at diagnosis. Twenty-four hours after last glucocorticoid dose, morning cortisol was reduced in 40/64 (62.5%) patients. LD-ACTH testing showed adrenal suppression in 52/64 (81.5%) patients. At the following ACTH test 7-14 days later, morning cortisol values were reduced in 8/52 (15.4%) patients and response to the test was impaired in 12/52 (23%). Adrenal function completely recovered in all patients within 10 weeks. No difference was found between patients treated with PDN or DXM. Almost 35% of children with impaired cortisol values at the first test developed signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. One child developed a severe adrenal crisis during adrenal suppression. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose glucocorticoid therapy in ALL children may cause prolonged adrenal suppression and related clinical symptoms. Laboratory monitoring of cortisol levels and steroid coverage during stress episodes may be indicated.","['Einaudi, Silvia', 'Bertorello, Nicoletta', 'Masera, Nicoletta', 'Farinasso, Loredana', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Corrias, Andrea', 'Villa, Alessia', 'Riva, Francesca', 'Saracco, Paola', 'Pastore, Guido']","['Einaudi S', 'Bertorello N', 'Masera N', 'Farinasso L', 'Barisone E', 'Rizzari C', 'Corrias A', 'Villa A', 'Riva F', 'Saracco P', 'Pastore G']","[""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Turin, Italy. silvein@libero.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex/drug effects', 'Adrenal Insufficiency/*chemically induced/drug therapy', '*Adrenocorticotropic Hormone', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Stress, Physiological/physiopathology', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/etiology/*physiopathology']",2007/09/11 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21339 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Mar;50(3):537-41. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21339.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparison group of 117 parents of healthy children was also recruited. All parents completed a questionnaire, providing demographic and medical information relating to the child, dispositional optimism, psychological distress, life satisfaction, coping and subjective health perception. RESULTS: Parents of children with cancer had higher levels of anxiety, depression, optimism, satisfaction with life and subjective health perception than the comparison group. Optimism was significantly correlated with satisfaction with life, subjective health perception, anxiety and depression in both groups. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the importance of optimism in relationship to psychological distress in parents of children with cancer.

Both flow cytometry (FCM) and RT-PCR were employed to assess the expression of Nup88, and the localization of Nup88 was determined by confocal microscopy. The results indicated that GA had strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction activity in U937 cells in vitro in a time-and dose-dependent manner. The 24-h IC(50) value was (1.019+/-0.134) mg/L. Moreover, GA induced arrest of U937 cells in G(0)/G(1) phase. Over-expression of Nup88 was found in U937 cells, whereas GA could significantly down-regulate both the protein and mRNA levels of Nup88. Nup88 was diffusely distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm and was located at the cytoplasmic side of nuclear rim, and occasionally in cytoplasm. It is suggested that GA exerts its anti-leukemia effects by regulating the expression and distribution of nucleoporin Nup88.

As a contribution to a large international effort to re-evaluate the A-bomb dosimetry, the concentration of the radionuclide (63)Ni (half-life 100.1 years) has been measured in copper samples from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These measurements were mainly performed at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratory in Munich, Germany, by means of accelerator mass spectrometry. Because the (63)Ni had been produced in these samples by fast A-bomb neutrons via the reaction (63)Cu(n,p)(63)Ni, these measurements allow direct experimental validation of calculated neutron doses to the members of the LSS cohort, for the first time. The results of these efforts have already been published in a compact form. A more detailed discussion of the methodical aspects of these measurements and their results are given in the present paper. Eight copper samples that had been significantly exposed to fast neutrons from the Hiroshima A-bomb explosion were investigated. In general, measured (63)Ni concentrations decreased in these samples with increasing distance to the hypocenter, from 4 x 10(6 ) (63)Ni nuclei per gram copper at 391 m, to about 1 x 10(5 ) (63)Ni nuclei per gram copper at about 1,400 m. Additional measurements performed on three large-distant copper samples from Hiroshima (distance to the hypocenter 1,880-7,500 m) and on three large-distant copper samples from Nagasaki (distance to the hypocenter 3,931-4,428 m) that were not exposed significantly to A-bomb neutrons, suggest a typical background concentration of about 8 x 10(4 ) (63)Ni nuclei per gram copper. If the observed background is accounted for, the results are consistent with state-of-the-art neutron transport calculations for Hiroshima, in particular for those distances where the victims survived and were included in the life span study cohort.","['Ruhm, W', 'Carroll, K L', 'Egbert, S D', 'Faestermann, T', 'Knie, K', 'Korschinek, G', 'Martinelli, R E', 'Marchetti, A A', 'McAninch, J E', 'Rugel, G', 'Straume, T', 'Wallner, A', 'Wallner, C', 'Fujita, S', 'Hasai, H', 'Hoshi, M', 'Shizuma, K']","['Ruhm W', 'Carroll KL', 'Egbert SD', 'Faestermann T', 'Knie K', 'Korschinek G', 'Martinelli RE', 'Marchetti AA', 'McAninch JE', 'Rugel G', 'Straume T', 'Wallner A', 'Wallner C', 'Fujita S', 'Hasai H', 'Hoshi M', 'Shizuma K']","['Institute for Radiation Protection, GSF National Research Center for Environment and Health, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, Neuherberg, Germany.

AT treatment of the donor induced a Th-2 cytokine profile in the adoptively transferred T cells and reduced their in vivo expansion, which translated into significantly reduced aGVHD lethality. Host treatment down-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhanced the protective statin effect, without impacting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. The AT effect was partially reversed in STAT6(-/-) donors and abrogated by L-mevalonate, indicating the relevance of STAT6 signaling and the L-mevalonate pathway for AT-mediated aGVHD protection. AT reduced prenylation levels of GTPases, abolished T-bet expression, and increased c-MAF and GATA-3 protein in vivo. Thus, AT has significant protective impact on aGVHD lethality by Th-2 polarization and inhibition of an uncontrolled Th-1 response while maintaining GVL activity, which is of great clinical relevance given the modest toxicity profile of AT.","['Zeiser, Robert', 'Youssef, Sawsan', 'Baker, Jeanette', 'Kambham, Neeraja', 'Steinman, Lawrence', 'Negrin, Robert S']","['Zeiser R', 'Youssef S', 'Baker J', 'Kambham N', 'Steinman L', 'Negrin RS']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070907,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat6 protein, mouse)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/drug effects', 'Atorvastatin', '*Chemoprevention', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Heptanoic Acids', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Mevalonic Acid/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Premedication', 'Pyrroles', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Th2 Cells/*cytology/immunology']",2007/09/11 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52911-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-106005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Dec 15;110(13):4588-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-106005.

Nonetheless, very little is known about the underlying mechanism of budding, primarily due to technical limitations preventing visualization of bud formation in real time. Methods capable of monitoring budding dynamics suffer from insufficient resolution, whereas other methods, such as electron microscopy, do not have the ability to operate under physiological conditions. Here we applied atomic force microscopy to real-time visualization of individual Moloney murine leukemia virus budding events. By using a single-particle analysis approach, we were able to observe distinct patterns in budding that otherwise remain transparent. We find that bud formation follows at least two kinetically distinct pathways. The majority of virions (74%) are produced in a slow process (>45 min), and the remaining particles (26%) assemble via a fast process (<25 min). Interestingly, repetitive budding from the same site was seen to occur in only two locations. This finding challenges the hypothesis that viral budding occurs from distinct sites and suggests that budding is not restricted laterally.

In the mouse model of MHC-mismatched combined heart and marrow transplantation, we compared conditioning of BALB/c hosts with total lymphoid irradiation (TLI: 10 doses of 240 cGy each) targeted to the spleen, lymph nodes and thymus to conditioning with a single dose of sublethal total body irradiation (TBI; 450 cGy). Conditioning also included three injections of anti-thymocyte serum (ATS), in both groups. C57BL/6 heart grafts, marrow cells and blood mononuclear cells were transplanted 24 h after the completion of irradiation. Blood mononuclear cells were added to the marrow cells to engender severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) that is present after combined organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation in humans given non-myeloablative conditioning. Both TLI and TBI conditioned groups accepted the organ grafts and became stable chimeras. However, the TBI group all died of GVHD during the 100-day observation period. The TLI group survived during the same period without clinical signs of GVHD. These hosts were tolerized to the donor organ grafts, since third party grafts were rejected rapidly when transplanted after 100 days. When NK T-cell-deficient CD1d(-/-) BALB/c hosts were used instead of wild-type hosts in the TLI/ATS conditioned group, then all hosts survived but all rejected the organ grafts and almost all failed to develop stable chimerism. None developed GVHD. Since host NK T cells were required for graft acceptance and NK T cells are activated after recognition of CD1d on antigen presenting cells, we compared heart and marrow graft survival from wild-type versus CD1d(-/-) donors after transplantation to TLI and ATS conditioned wild-type hosts. Whereas marrow and heart grafts from wild-type donors were accepted, almost all grafts from CD1d donors were rejected. Grafts from control Jalpha18(-/-) donors that were NK T cell deficient but expressed CD1d were all accepted. The results indicate that host NK T cells facilitate graft acceptance by recognizing CD1d on donor cells. We applied the TLI conditioning regimen using 10 doses of 80 cGy each and 5 doses of rabbit ATG to human recipients of HLA-matched G-CSF ""mobilized"" blood mononuclear cell transplants for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma [R. Lowsky, T. Takahashi, Y.P. Liu, et al., Protective conditioning for acute graft-versus-host disease. N. Engl. J. Med. 353 (2005) 1321-1331.]. Currently more than 100 transplants have been performed, and the incidence of acute GVHD has been about 4% when both MRD and MUD transplants are combined. Almost all recipients became complete chimeras after receiving grafts that contained 2-3x10(8) CD3(+) T cells/kg. In further studies, we applied the same TLI and ATG conditioning regimen to combined kidney and G-CSF ""mobilized"" blood stem cell transplantation from HLA-matched sibling donors. The hematopoietic grafts in the latter protocol were selected CD34(+) cells with 1x10(6) CD3(+) T cells/kg added back to the hematopoietic cells. Preliminary results indicate that stable mixed chimerism can be achieved using this protocol allowing for complete immunosuppressive drug withdrawal without GVHD or subsequent rejection episodes. Thus, conditioning with TLI based regimens can simultaneously protect against organ graft rejection and GVHD. Levels of chimerism are dependent upon the content of donor T cells in the hematopoietic graft.","['Strober, Samuel']",['Strober S'],"['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305-5166, USA. sstrober@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20070910,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Organ Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2007/09/11 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(07)00138-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Jan-Feb;40(1):48-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.019.

In Jurkat cells, PKB/Akt is constitutively active and phosphorylated at the activation-loop residue (Thr308). 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), an enzyme that also contains a PH domain, is thought to catalyse Thr308 phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in addition to other kinase families such as PKC isoforms. It is unknown however if the loss of PTEN in Jurkat cells also results in unregulated PDK-1 activity and whether such loss impacts on activation-loop phosphorylation of other putative PDK-1 substrates such as PKC. In this study we have addressed if loss of PTEN in Jurkat T cells affects PDK-1 catalytic activity and intracellular localisation. We demonstrate that reducing the level of 3'-phosphoinositides in Jurkat cells with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3-kinase or expression of PTEN does not affect PDK-1 activity, Ser241 phosphorylation or intracellular localisation. In support of this finding, we show that the levels of PKC activation-loop phosphorylation are unaffected by reductions in the levels of 3'-phosphoinositides. Instead, the dephosphorylation that occurs on PKB/Akt at Thr308 following reductions in 3'-phosphoinositides is dependent on PP2A-like phosphatase activity. Our finding that PDK-1 functions independently of 3'-phosphoinositides in T cells is also confirmed by studies in HuT-78 T cells, a PTEN-expressing cell line with undetectable levels of 3'-phosphoinositides. We conclude therefore that loss of PTEN expression in Jurkat T cells does not impact on the PDK-1/PKC pathway and that only a subset of kinases, such as PKB/Akt, are perturbed as a consequence PTEN loss.","['Freeley, Michael', 'Park, Jongsun', 'Yang, Keum-Jin', 'Wange, Ronald L', 'Volkov, Yuri', 'Kelleher, Dermot', 'Long, Aideen']","['Freeley M', 'Park J', 'Yang KJ', 'Wange RL', 'Volkov Y', 'Kelleher D', 'Long A']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. freeleym@tcd.ie']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070803,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Wortmannin']",2007/09/11 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(07)00229-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.07.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2007 Dec;19(12):2444-57. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.07.020.

Since clinical trials with amonafide, a unique ATP-independent Topo II inhibitor, in combination with cytarabine, have shown significant efficacy for remission induction in patients with sAML, we compared the cytotoxic effect of amonafide (amonafide l-malate, Xanafide) to the classical Topo II inhibitors (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, etoposide, and mitoxantrone) in K562 leukemia cells and in the MDR subline, K562/DOX. Pgp expression was found to be approximately 6.5-fold greater in K562/DOX and causes the rapid efflux of these drugs from the leukemia cell. As a consequence, the LC(50) values for the classical Topo II inhibitor drugs tested were each increased up to 3 log units. A similar result was also observed in murine P388 and P388/ADR leukemia cells. Addition of cyclosporin A reversed K562/DOX resistance for the classical Topo II inhibitors, decreasing their LC(50) values to the levels observed with wild type cells but had no effect on amonafide potency in Pgp+ or wild type cells. Further examination of amonafide in bidirectional Caco-2 and MDR1-MDCK models confirmed that amonafide is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of Pgp. These observations suggest that amonafide is a promising therapeutic candidate directed toward bypassing this common mechanism of drug resistance encountered in the treatment of patients with AML, and possibly in other resistant hematological malignancies as well.","['Chau, Mydoanh', 'Christensen, Jennifer L', 'Ajami, Alfred M', 'Capizzi, Robert L']","['Chau M', 'Christensen JL', 'Ajami AM', 'Capizzi RL']","['Xanthus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070910,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Adenine', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imides/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Naphthalimides/*pharmacology', 'Organophosphonates', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2007/09/11 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00302-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.07.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Mar;32(3):465-73. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.07.017.

17825686,NLM,MEDLINE,20071009,20181211,0149-2918 (Print) 0149-2918 (Linking),29,7,2007 Jul,Sunitinib malate for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,1338-53,"BACKGROUND: Sunitinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 26, 2006, for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in patients who have failed to respond to imatinib or were unable to tolerate it. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sunitinib; potential drug interactions; and the results of clinical trials evaluating its efficacy and tolerability. METHODS: Pertinent literature was identified by searches of MEDLINE (1966-January 31, 2007), the American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts database (2000-2007 annual meetings/symposia and previous meetings), and the FDA Web site (October 2006). Search terms included, but were not limited to, sunitinib, SUl1248, renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, adverse events, and clinical trial. Additional publications were found by scanning the reference lists of the identified articles. RESULTS: Sunitinib is a potent inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors. Its Tmax is reached within 6 to 12 hours, and food does not appear to affect its bioavailability. Sunitinib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to an active metabolite, SU12662, which is further metabolized by CYP3A4 to an inactive moiety. The parent compound and active metabolite have similar biochemical activity and potency and reach similar plasma concentrations. Sunitinib and SU12662 have a tl/2 of 40 to 60 hours and 80 to 110 hours, respectively. Steady-state concentrations of both active entities are reached after 10 to 14 days of therapy. In a Phase III trial comparing sunitinib with interferon-alfa (IFN-00 as first-line therapy for mRCC, sunitinib was associated with a median progression-free survival of 11 months, compared with 5 months with IFN-cz (P < 0.001). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating sunitinib as second-line therapy for GIST found a median time to progression of 28.9 weeks in the sunitinib arm, compared with 7 weeks in the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.28; P < 0.001). In Phase II trials, sunitinib also had anti-tumor activity in patients with breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, and non-small cell lung cancer. Further evaluation in these tumors, as well as in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, may lead to expanded indications. The approved dose of sunitinib is 50 mg/d PO for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest; this pattern is repeated until tumor progression or the occurrence of intolerable adverse effects. The most common clinical toxicities attributable to sunitinib include diarrhea, mucositis/stomatitis, hypertension, rash, skin discoloration, and altered taste, whereas commonly occurring laboratory abnormalities have been seen in association with gastrointestinal toxicity, renal toxicity, and hematologic toxicity. Of grade 3/4 toxicities occurring with sunitinib (which are relatively uncommon [<10%]), those that are clinically important include hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, and hand-foot syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib is a multiple tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor approved for the treatment of mRCC and GIST. Evidence for long-term clinical benefit in renal cell cancer and other tumors awaits the results of ongoing trials.","['Adams, Val R', 'Leggas, Markos']","['Adams VR', 'Leggas M']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA. vadam0@email.uky.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/complications/*drug therapy', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lactation', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pyrroles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sunitinib']",2007/09/11 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0149-2918(07)00214-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.07.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2007 Jul;29(7):1338-53. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.07.022.,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene complexes encoding both KIRs and HLA ligands are extremely polymorphic. Because the extent of NK cell inhibition varies with the allelic forms expressed, NK cell tolerance can be broken more easily in some individuals than in others. This explains why particular combinations of KIR and HLA genes are associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases or with more efficient antiviral responses. Breaking of NK cell tolerance might be prerequisite to kill leukemic blasts. At present, there are ample indications that NK cells can eradicate acute myeloid leukemia blasts in patients with a favorable combination of HLA and KIR genes. Selecting these individuals for clinical trials should give insight into the feasibility of anti-tumor therapy mediated through NK cells.","['Passweg, Jakob R', 'Huard, Bertrand', 'Tiercy, Jean-Marie', 'Roosnek, Eddy']","['Passweg JR', 'Huard B', 'Tiercy JM', 'Roosnek E']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070907,England,Trends Immunol,Trends in immunology,100966032,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Autoimmunity', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/immunology/metabolism']",2007/09/11 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1471-4906(07)00188-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.it.2007.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Immunol. 2007 Oct;28(10):437-41. doi: 10.1016/j.it.2007.07.008.

METHODS: The cell line L929-FL transfected with human FL gene was used as immunogen. The hybridomas secreting the antibodies against human FL were obtained by fusing splenoecytes from the immunized mice with murine myeloma cells(Sp2/0). Their subclasses were analyzed using fast-strip method. The monoclonal antibodies were produced in mouse peritoneal cavity and purified by Protein G affinity chromatography. The inhibitory effect of mAbs against FL on leukemia cell lines U937 and HL-60 was detected by MTT. The apoptosis of U937 and HL-60 cells stained by annexin-V/PI was determined by FCM. RESULTS: Three hybridomas named 3C2, 3C6 and 8D10 were successfully obtained, which secreted monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule stably. Their subclasses were the mouse IgG2a with kappa light chains. The three monoclonal antibodies recognized the FL molecule on U937 and HL-60 cells that also coexpressed Flt3 molecule. When U937 and HL-60 cells were cultured in presence of 3C2, 3C6 and 8D10, their proliferation was reduced as compared to that in control in MTT assay(P < 0.05). The analysis of annexin-V/PI binding to U937 and HL-60 cells by FCM showed the mAbs had the apoptotogenic activity of the monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule. CONCLUSION: 3C2, 3C6 and 8D10 are three funtional monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule. They may be of some value in the study of the roles of FL/Flt3 interaction in leukemia pathogenesis.","['Zhou, Chun-gang', 'Tian, Xiao-jing', 'Ju, Song-guang', 'Xu, Ying', 'Yu, Ge-hua', 'Zhang, Xue-guang', 'Gu, Zong-jiang']","['Zhou CG', 'Tian XJ', 'Ju SG', 'Xu Y', 'Yu GH', 'Zhang XG', 'Gu ZJ']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215007, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Subunits)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Subunits/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",2007/09/11 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Sep;23(9):850-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell growth and proliferation were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay. Cell cycle distribution and expression of cell membrane surface differentiation-related antigens (such as CD11b, CD64 and CD14) were determined by flow cytometry assay. Expression of PLZF was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Functional differentiation was reflected by nitroblue tetrazolium(NBT) reduction ability and cytochemistry staining. RESULTS: While U937/PLZF cells were incubated in tetracycline-withdrawn medium, the expression of PLZF-RARalpha; protein increased. After treated with As(2)O(3) (0.5 micromol/L) and ATRA (1 mumol/L), U937/PLZF cells presented some changes such as decreased nuclear/cytoplasm ratio, and partial disappearance of nucleoli, suggesting a certain degree of morphological differentiation. The cell growth and proliferation were inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The proportion of cells in S phage was decreased and CD11b level was increased. The expression of PLZF relocated in treated cells. However, no significant difference in NBT assay and cytochemistry staining was documented with the combination therapy.

RD114-TR-pseudotyped vectors may be concentrated by centrifugation, are resistant to complement inactivation, and are suitable for both ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy applications. We analyzed RD114-TR-pseudotyped, HIV-1-derived lentiviral vectors for their ability to transduce human cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood mobilized CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Transduction efficiency was analyzed in CD34(+) cells in liquid culture, in CD34(+) clonogenic progenitors in semisolid culture, and in CD34(+) repopulating stem cells after xenotransplantation in NOD-SCID mice. Compared with a standard VSV-G-based packaging system, RD114-TR-pseudotyped particles transduced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells at lower multiplicity of infection, with lower toxicity and less pseudo-transduction at comparable vector copy number per genome. Potential changes in the CD34(+) cell transcription profile and phenotype on transduction with RD114-TR-pseudotyped vectors was comparatively investigated by microarray analysis. Our study shows that the biology of repopulating hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny is not affected by transduction with RD114-TR-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. RD114-TR is compatible with the development of lentiviral stable packaging cell lines, and may become the envelope of choice for clinical studies aiming at safe and efficient genetic modification of human hematopoietic stem cells.","['Di Nunzio, F', 'Piovani, B', 'Cosset, F-L', 'Mavilio, F', 'Stornaiuolo, A']","['Di Nunzio F', 'Piovani B', 'Cosset FL', 'Mavilio F', 'Stornaiuolo A']","['MolMed, 20132 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/blood/immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/chemistry', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2007/09/11 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/09/11 09:00'],"['2007/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2006.138 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2007 Sep;18(9):811-20. doi: 10.1089/hum.2006.138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The antiangiogenic Akt/NF-kappaB inhibitor xanthohumol (XN) has in vitro activity against acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines (AML, CML) and fresh samples from patients were investigated. RESULTS: Inhibition of cell proliferation is associated with induction of apoptosis and reduced VEGF secretion. Decreased cell invasion, metalloprotease production, and adhesion to endothelial cells observed in the presence of XN could prevent in vivo life-threatening complications of leukostasis and tissue infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: As endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells are mutually correlated in their development and growth, targeting both tumor cells and endothelial cells with agents possessing cytotoxic and antiangiogenic activities may lead to synergistic antitumor effects interrupting a reciprocal stimulatory loop between leukemia and endothelial cells.","[""Dell'Eva, Raffaella"", 'Ambrosini, Claudia', 'Vannini, Nicola', 'Piaggio, Giovanna', 'Albini, Adriana', 'Ferrari, Nicoletta']","[""Dell'Eva R"", 'Ambrosini C', 'Vannini N', 'Piaggio G', 'Albini A', 'Ferrari N']","['Molecular Oncology, National Institute for Cancer Research, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Propiophenones)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'T4467YT1NT (xanthohumol)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy', 'Propiophenones/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects']",2007/09/08 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23017 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):2007-11. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To study the effects induced by the co-infection of HIV-1 and HTLV-1 upon CD4+ cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1997, our group has been following a cohort of HTLV-1-infected patients, in order to study the interaction of HTLV-1 with HIV and/or with hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as HTLV-1-only infected asymptomatic carriers and those with tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). One hundred and fifty HTLV-1-infected subjects have been referred to our clinic at the Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"", Sao Paulo. Twenty-seven of them were also infected with HIV-1 and HTLV-1-infection using two ELISAs and confirmed and typed by Western Blot (WB) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All subjects were evaluated by two neurologists, blinded to the patient's HTLV status, and the TSP/HAM diagnostic was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. AIDS-defining events were in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification of 1988. The first T CD4+ cells count available before starting anti-retroviral therapy are shown compared to the HIV-1-infected subjects at the moment of AIDS defining event. RESULTS: A total of 27 HIV-1/HTLV-1 co-infected subjects were identified in this cohort; 15 already had AIDS and 12 remained free of AIDS. The median of T CD4+ cell counts was 189 (98-688) cells/mm(3) and 89 (53-196) cells/mm(3) for co-infected subjects who had an AIDS-defining event, and HIV-only infected individuals, respectively (p = 0.036). Eight of 27 co-infected subjects (30%) were diagnosed as having a TSP/HAM simile diagnosis, and three of them had opportunistic infections but high T CD4+ cell counts at the time of their AIDS- defining event. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that higher T CD4+ cells count among HIV-1/HTLV-1-coinfected subjects was found in 12% of the patients who presented an AIDS-defining event. These subjects also showed a TSP/HAM simile picture when it was the first manifestation of disease; this incidence is 20 times higher than that for HTLV-1-only infected subjects in endemic areas.","['Casseb, Jorge', 'Posada-Vergara, Maria Paulina', 'Montanheiro, Patricia', 'Fukumori, Ligia Maria Ichii', 'Olah, Ingrid', 'Smid, Jerusa', 'Duarte, Alberto Jose da Silva', 'Penalva de Oliveira, Augusto Cesar']","['Casseb J', 'Posada-Vergara MP', 'Montanheiro P', 'Fukumori LM', 'Olah I', 'Smid J', 'Duarte AJ', 'Penalva de Oliveira AC']","['HTLV Patient Clinic, lnstitute of lnfectious Diseases Emilio Ribas, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

METHODS: Data of deaths were obtained from the Mortality Information System and of hospital morbidity from the Hospital Information System. Deaths were categorized according to primary tumor sites, selected in accordance with the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases. The population data were drawn from the inter census estimates of the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). The period of analysis was the triennial 2002-2004, with the most recent mortality data in Brazil. The average of this period was calculated to ensure greater stability of the rates. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2004, 405,415 deaths from neoplasias occurred in Brazil. The highest rates of mortality were identified in the South and South-East regions. For men, cancer of the trachea, bronchi and lungs were the malignant neoplasias with the highest mortality rate while for women breast cancer was highest.

However, the specific stimuli and signal pathways that may control ES cell-mediated cardiomyogenesis remains to be completely defined. The aim of the present study was to investigate (1) the effect and underlying signal transduction pathways of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone-morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2)-induced mouse ES cell (mES-D3 line) differentiation into cardiomyocytes (CMC) and (2) the efficacy of CMC precommitted mES cells for functional and anatomical cardiac repair in surgically-induced mouse acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model. Various doses of LIF and BMP-2 and their inhibitors or blocking antibodies were tested for mES differentiation to CMC in vitro. CMC differentiation was assessed by mRNA and protein expression of CMC-specific markers, Connexin-43, CTI, CTT, Mef2c, Tbx5, Nkx2.5, GATA-4, and alphaMHC. LIF and BMP-2 synergistically induced the expression of CMC markers as early as 2 to 4 days in culture. Signaling studies identified STAT3 and MAP kinase (ERK1/2) as specific signaling components of LIF+BMP-2-mediated CMC differentiation. Inhibition of either STAT3 or MAPK activation by specific inhibitors drastically suppressed LIF+BMP-2-mediated CMC differentiation. Moreover, in mouse AMI, transplantation of lentivirus-GFP-transduced, LIF+BMP-2 precommitted mES cells, improved post-MI left ventricular functions, and enhanced capillary density. Transplanted cells engrafted in myocardium and differentiated into CMC and endothelial cells. Our data suggest that LIF and BMP-2 may synergistically enhance CMC differentiation of transplanted stem cells. Thus augmentation of LIF/BMP-2 downstream signaling components or cell type specific precommitment may facilitate the effects of ES cell-based therapies for post-MI myocardial repair and regeneration.","['Rajasingh, Johnson', 'Bord, Evelyn', 'Hamada, Hiromichi', 'Lambers, Erin', 'Qin, Gangjian', 'Losordo, Douglas W', 'Kishore, Raj']","['Rajasingh J', 'Bord E', 'Hamada H', 'Lambers E', 'Qin G', 'Losordo DW', 'Kishore R']","['Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 303 E Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070906,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (U 0126)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SHQ47990PH (cucurbitacin I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/pharmacology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Capillaries/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myocardial Infarction/pathology/*therapy', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology/physiology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2007/09/08 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['CIRCRESAHA.107.156786 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.156786 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2007 Oct 26;101(9):910-8. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.156786.

Here, we show that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) resulted in loss of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) response in three different lymphoma cell lines, which plays a key role in the development of cancer, especially lymphoma and leukemia. The AhR-mediated inhibition of apoptosis in vitro was associated with a clear increase of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and deregulation of genes of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family involved in apoptosis including Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 in several lymphoma cell lines. Treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 and the AhR antagonist 3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone abolished the TCDD-induced resistance of apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, using micropositron emission tomography imaging, in vivo findings demonstrated that exposure to TCDD promotes the development of lymphoma in superficial lymph nodes of C57BL/10J mice, which was associated with a marked increase of COX-2 expression in the affected lymph nodes. The results indicate that AhR activation and COX-2 overexpression likely represent a mechanism of resistance to apoptosis in lymphoma cell lines that might be relevant for the development of lymphoma in vivo.","['Vogel, Christoph F A', 'Li, Wen', 'Sciullo, Eric', 'Newman, John', 'Hammock, Bruce', 'Reader, J Rachel', 'Tuscano, Joseph', 'Matsumura, Fumio']","['Vogel CF', 'Li W', 'Sciullo E', 'Newman J', 'Hammock B', 'Reader JR', 'Tuscano J', 'Matsumura F']","['Department of Environmental Toxicology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA. cfvogel@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070906,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"[""0 (3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone)"", '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '123653-11-2 (N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",2007/09/08 09:00,2008/01/26 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)62415-7 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2007.070406 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2007 Nov;171(5):1538-48. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2007.070406.

In human RUNX1-related leukemias, the RAS pathway is often concurrently mutated, but the mechanism of the synergism remains elusive. Here, we found that inactivation of Runx1 in mouse bone marrow cells results in an increase in the stem/progenitor cell fraction due to suppression of apoptosis and elevated expression of the polycomb gene Bmi-1, which is important for stem cell self-renewal. Introduction of oncogenic N-RAS into wild-type cells, in contrast, reduced the stem/progenitor cell fraction because of senescence, apoptosis, and differentiation. Such detrimental events presumably occurred because of the cellular fail-safe program, although hyperproliferation was initially induced by an oncogenic stimulus. Runx1 insufficiency appears to impair such a fail-safe mechanism, particularly in the stem/progenitor cells, thereby supporting the clonal maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells expressing an activated oncogene.

During the course of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in a transgenic mutant SOD1 mouse model of the disease, expression and activity of EAAT2 is remarkably reduced. We previously showed that some of the mutant SOD1 proteins exposed to oxidative stress inhibit EAAT2 by triggering caspase-3 cleavage of EAAT2 at a single defined locus. This gives rise to two fragments that we termed truncated EAAT2 and COOH terminus of EAAT2 (CTE). In this study, we report that analysis of spinal cord homogenates prepared from mutant G93A-SOD1 mice reveals CTE to be of a higher molecular weight than expected because it is conjugated with SUMO-1. The sumoylated CTE fragment (CTE-SUMO-1) accumulates in the spinal cord of these mice as early as presymptomatic stage (70 days of age) and not in other central nervous system areas unaffected by the disease. The presence and accumulation of CTE-SUMO-1 is specific to ALS mice, since it does not occur in the R6/2 mouse model for Huntington disease. Furthermore, using an astroglial cell line, primary culture of astrocytes, and tissue samples from G93A-SOD1 mice, we show that CTE-SUMO-1 is targeted to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Since one of the proposed functions of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies is regulation of gene transcription, we suggest a possible novel mechanism by which the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could contribute to the pathology of ALS.","['Gibb, Stuart L', 'Boston-Howes, William', 'Lavina, Zeno S', 'Gustincich, Stefano', 'Brown, Robert H Jr', 'Pasinelli, Piera', 'Trotti, Davide']","['Gibb SL', 'Boston-Howes W', 'Lavina ZS', 'Gustincich S', 'Brown RH Jr', 'Pasinelli P', 'Trotti D']","['Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Weinberg Unit for ALS Research, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, and Cecil B.

MCL-1 has an unusual N-terminal extension, which contains a PEST domain and several phosphorylation sites that have been suggested to regulate its turnover. Here we report that the first 79 amino acids of MCL-1 regulate its subcellular localization. Deletion of this domain impairs both its mitochondrial localization and its anti-apoptotic activity. Conversely, expression of the N terminus of MCL-1 promotes both the association of MCL-1 with mitochondria and cell survival in a fashion that is dependent on the presence of endogenous MCL-1. In addition, the N terminus of MCL-1 has an antagonistic effect on proliferation. Although MCL-1 decreases proliferation through binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 in the nucleus, the N terminus of MCL-1 accelerates cell division. On the other hand, deletion of this region further increases the anti-proliferative activity of MCL-1.

HB-EGF is known to induce vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation by activating PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathway. However, our preliminary data showed that Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway was also involved in HB-EGF induced VSMC proliferation. More interestingly, HB-EGF (10 ng/ml) induced a biphasic activation of STAT3 (early at 5 min and late at 60-120 min). Therefore, we tried to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this delayed STAT3 activation by HB-EGF in VSMCs. First, we examined the effect of HB-EGF on interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expressions, since IL-6 have been implicated in the regulation of STAT3 activation. According to our data, HB-EGF increased transcription of IL-6, cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The secretion of IL-6 was also increased by HB-EGF. Furthermore, these HB-EGF-mediated up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA expression and secretion were inhibited by NF-kappaB inhibitor Bay117082 (2.5 microM) treatment suggesting involvement of NF-kappaB pathway. Again, the late activation of STAT3 by HB-EGF was abolished by both Bay117082 and IL-6 neutralizing antibody (1 microg/ml) indicating IL-6 is a key molecule in the delayed activation of STAT3 by HB-EGF. In addition, IL-6 neutralizing antibody inhibited both HB-EGF conditioned media induced STAT3 activation and HB-EGF induced VSMC proliferation. In conclusion, IL-6 plays an important role in the delayed activation of STAT3 and VSMC proliferation induced by HB-EGF.","['Lee, Kuy-Sook', 'Park, Jin-Hee', 'Lee, Seahyoung', 'Lim, Hyun-Joung', 'Choi, Hye-Eun', 'Park, Hyun-Young']","['Lee KS', 'Park JH', 'Lee S', 'Lim HJ', 'Choi HE', 'Park HY']","['Center for Biomedical Sciences, Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, National Institute of Health, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070717,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hbegf protein, rat)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2007/09/08 09:00,2007/12/20 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(07)00166-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2007 Nov;1773(11):1637-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.07.001.

The availability of tolerable broad-spectrum antifungals like voriconazole stimulated the discussion about optimal timing of antifungal therapy. We conducted a trial to analyze the efficacy and safety of voriconazole in the prevention of lung infiltrates during induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). METHODS: This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial in AML patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. Oral voriconazole 200 mg twice daily or placebo was administered until detection of a lung infiltrate or end of neutropenia. Primary efficacy parameter was the incidence of lung infiltrates until day 21 after initiation of chemotherapy. Secondary objectives were incidence of infections, length of stay in hospital, time to antifungal treatment, time to first fever, and drug safety. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were randomly assigned to receive voriconazole (N=10) or placebo (N=15). Incidence of lung infiltrates until day 21 was 0 (0%) in the voriconazole and 5 (33%) in the placebo group (P=0.06). Average length of stay in hospital was shorter in the voriconazole group (mean 31.9 days) than in the placebo group (mean 37.3 days, P=0.09). Four patients were diagnosed with hepatosplenic candidiasis until a 4 week follow-up, all in the placebo group (P=0.11). Adverse events and toxicity did not differ between the two treatment groups. The trial was stopped prematurely when another trial demonstrated reduced mortality by antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole, thus rendering further randomisation against placebo unethical. CONCLUSION: In AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy, prophylactic oral voriconazole 200 mg twice daily resulted in trends towards reduced incidences of lung infiltrates and hepatosplenic candidiasis. Voriconazole was safe and well tolerated.","['Vehreschild, Jorg J', 'Bohme, Angelika', 'Buchheidt, Dieter', 'Arenz, Dorothee', 'Harnischmacher, Urs', 'Heussel, Claus P', 'Ullmann, Andrew J', 'Mousset, Sabine', 'Hummel, Margit', 'Frommolt, Peter', 'Wassmer, Gernot', 'Drzisga, Ivonne', 'Cornely, Oliver A']","['Vehreschild JJ', 'Bohme A', 'Buchheidt D', 'Arenz D', 'Harnischmacher U', 'Heussel CP', 'Ullmann AJ', 'Mousset S', 'Hummel M', 'Frommolt P', 'Wassmer G', 'Drzisga I', 'Cornely OA']","['Klinikum der Universitat zu Koln, Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Studienzentrum Infektiologie II, 50937 Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070906,England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Placebos)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Placebos/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2007/09/08 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-4453(07)00693-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinf.2007.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect. 2007 Nov;55(5):445-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jinf.2007.07.003.

However, its specific metabolic role in human macrophages has not been fully explored. METHODS: The present study used lentivirus containing either shRNA or cDNA for EL to decrease or increase EL expression, respectively in THP-1 macrophages to investigate the consequence on LDL binding and cell association. RESULTS: EL suppression significantly decreased the binding and cell association of native LDL (52% and 33%) and mildly oxLDL (43% and 36%) as well as extensively oxLDL binding (36%) in THP-1 macrophages. EL overexpression markedly increased the binding and cell association of native LDL (3.1- and 2.2-fold), mildly oxLDL (1.9- and 1.4-fold), and extensively oxLDL (1.5- and 1.5-fold). An inactive mutant EL compromised EL-mediated cell association of native and mildly oxLDL but not extensively oxLDL. Heparinase treatment almost completely eliminated EL-mediated native and oxLDL binding and cell association in THP-1 macrophages. LDL receptor blocking by antibodies decreased EL-mediated native LDL binding and cell association by 24% and 54%, respectively. Neither receptor associated protein or CD36 antibody treatment led to changes in EL-mediated lipoprotein binding and cell association. Furthermore, wild-type and the catalytically inactive mutant EL increased lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: EL expression promotes the binding and uptake of native and oxidized LDL in THP-1 macrophages in a heparan sulfate proteoglycan-dependent manner, and the LDL receptor was partly responsible for the EL-enhanced uptake of native LDL.","['Qiu, Guosong', 'Hill, John S']","['Qiu G', 'Hill JS']","[""Atherosclerosis Specialty Laboratory, Healthy Heart Program, St. Paul's Hospital, James Hogg iCAPTURE Centre for Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070811,England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (LIPG protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (Lipase)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lipase/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism/physiology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/pathology']",2007/09/08 09:00,2009/03/11 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-6363(07)00367-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2007 Dec 1;76(3):528-38. doi: 10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.08.002.

Various differences have been described between sporadic breast cancer and that associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. Expression of the PML protein has not been studied yet. The aim of this study was to determine if there is any difference in PML protein expression in breast cancer of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation carriers compared to sporadic breast cancer and if the PML protein can be used as a prognostic marker. There were 47 breast cancer samples included, 14 and 10 from BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation carriers, respectively, and 23 from patients without a BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutation. Immunofluorescence staining was used. Downregulation of PML protein expression was found in 2 of 14 (14%), 3 of 10 (30%) and 15 of 47 (31%) cases of breast cancer samples from BRCA1, BRCA2 and no BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively (p(BRCA1) = 0.019; p(BRCA2) = 0.111). There was no correlation between PML protein expression and age, histological types, estrogen and progesterone receptor, c-erbB-2 and PCNA expression, TNM classification, disease-free and overall survival. In conclusion, the PML protein is downregulated in approximately 30% of breast cancers cases. Downregulation of PML protein expression was significantly less frequent in BRCA1 mutation carriers compared to sporadic cases. No correlation was found between PML protein expression and any of the other clinical and laboratory characteristics.","['Plevova, P', 'Bouchal, J', 'Fiuraskova, M', 'Foretova, L', 'Navratilova, M', 'Zapletalova, J', 'Curik, R', 'Kubala, O', 'Prokop, J', 'Kolar, Z']","['Plevova P', 'Bouchal J', 'Fiuraskova M', 'Foretova L', 'Navratilova M', 'Zapletalova J', 'Curik R', 'Kubala O', 'Prokop J', 'Kolar Z']","['Institute of Pathology and Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Medical Faculty of the Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic. pavlina.plevova@volny.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics', 'BRCA2 Protein/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Lobular/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2007/09/08 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2007;54(4):263-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the effects are seen on the bone marrow cell, it was intended to find out if these adverse effects could be used for the benefits in leukaemia patients, using in-vitro study on leukaemic cell lines. The study showed inhibition of growth of the leukaemia cells by chloramphenicol which was comparable to or better than daunorubicin in some cell lines.

Our research group aims to contribute to the unravelling of the genetic basis of NB. Insight into the genes and signalling pathways involved in tumour formation and development can represent an essential step towards the development of more efficient molecular targeted therapies. A first part of our research work was devoted to the analysis of genomic alterations in NB. By means of a new highly sensitive method for detecting gains and losses of chromosomal segments, we recognised three major prognostic relevant genomic subtypes of NB. In addition smaller subgroups with deviating genomic patterns were detected. In addition, this work yielded important information regarding delineation of critical regions of gain and loss in NB which should facilitate further selection of candidate oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes. A second important part of our work focussed on the gene expression profiling of NB precursor cells. We were able as the first to isolate these cells and determine their transcriptome, a finding of fundamental importance for future expression studies in NB. Another study focussed on the identification of MYCN transcriptional target genes. Gene expression analyses of model systems developed in our lab and of a large panel of cell lines and tumours allowed us to subtract a list of candidate genes which are now under further study. Finally, we initiated research towards the understanding of the role of methylation in NB oncogenesis. From this, we were able to create a list of potentially relevant methylated genes in NB. From the above it is clear that our team has made important contributions to the understanding of the complex biology and clinical behaviour of NB. Also, a broad technically innovative research platform has been developed which will allow us to dissect NB genetics with greater speed and accuracy.","['Speleman, F', 'De Preter, K', 'Hoebeeck, J', 'Van Roy, N', 'Vandesompele, J']","['Speleman F', 'De Preter K', 'Hoebeeck J', 'Van Roy N', 'Vandesompele J']",,['dut'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Belgium,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg,Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van Belgie,0413210,,IM,"['*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/pathology']",2007/09/08 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/09/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg. 2007;69(4):167-96.,Nieuwe inzichten in de genetische basis van neuroblastoom.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a preoperative CBC included mild nonregenerative anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and 17% unclassified cells. On cytologic examination of aspirates from the dog's enlarged spleen and peripheral lymph nodes, a population of primitive round cells that occasionally resembled megakaryocytes was observed. A bone marrow aspirate specimen was markedly hypercellular with approximately 65% of marrow cells comprising a homogeneous population of immature hematopoietic cells similar to those found in the spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Using immunocytochemical stains with canine-specific antibodies, all neoplastic cells strongly expressed cytoplasmic CD41 and 20-70% of the neoplastic cells expressed CD34 weakly to moderately. Rare (<0.5%) neoplastic cells weakly expressed vWF. The cells were negative for all other markers. Based on these results and the morphology of the neoplastic cells, a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMegL) was made.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this second study is to better quantify the carcinogenic risk of APM, beginning treatment during fetal life. METHODS: We studied groups of 70-95 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats administered APM (2,000, 400, or 0 ppm) with feed from the 12th day of fetal life until natural death. RESULTS: Our results show a) a significant dose-related increase of malignant tumor-bearing animals in males (p < 0.01), particularly in the group treated with 2,000 ppm APM (p < 0.01); b) a significant increase in incidence of lymphomas/leukemias in males treated with 2,000 ppm (p < 0.05) and a significant dose-related increase in incidence of lymphomas/leukemias in females (p < 0.01), particularly in the 2,000-ppm group (p < 0.01); and c) a significant dose-related increase in incidence of mammary cancer in females (p < 0.05), particularly in the 2,000-ppm group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this carcinogenicity bioassay confirm and reinforce the first experimental demonstration of APM's multipotential carcinogenicity at a dose level close to the acceptable daily intake for humans. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that when life-span exposure to APM begins during fetal life, its carcinogenic effects are increased.","['Soffritti, Morando', 'Belpoggi, Fiorella', 'Tibaldi, Eva', 'Esposti, Davide Degli', 'Lauriola, Michelina']","['Soffritti M', 'Belpoggi F', 'Tibaldi E', 'Esposti DD', 'Lauriola M']","['Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Center, European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences, Bologna, Italy. crcfr@ramazzini.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Sweetening Agents)', 'Z0H242BBR1 (Aspartame)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aspartame/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sweetening Agents/*toxicity', 'Toxicity Tests, Chronic']",2007/09/07 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.10271 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Sep;115(9):1293-7. doi: 10.1289/ehp.10271.,,,PMC1964906,,,,,,,"['Environ Health Perspect. 2008 Jun;116(6):A239-40; author reply A240.

Alternative donors such as matched unrelated donors (MUDs), mismatched related donors (haploidentical), or unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) units have emerged as options as well. The most experience thus far has been with MUD donors, mostly attributed to the development of allele-specific DNA-based HLA-typing methods. The biggest drawback remains the significant delay needed to locate a donor. Haploidentical donors exist for almost all patients, and offer the convenience of a living related donor. However, significant rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other toxicities continue to complicate such HLA mismatching. UCB is the most recent option for source of stem cells. Frozen cord blood units can be acquired almost immediately and are able to safely traverse 1 or 2-HLA antigen mismatch barriers. The experience with UCB has been limited by the low cell dose, although recent innovations are attempting to overcome this. In this review, we summarize the current experience and knowledge with alternative donors as stem cell sources for reduced-intensity transplantation.","['Chen, Y-B', 'Spitzer, T R']","['Chen YB', 'Spitzer TR']","['Hematology/Oncology Unit, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20070906,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Fetal Blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/09/07 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404932 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404932 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jan;22(1):31-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404932.

We improved the cultivation technique using an immunostimulatory CpG-oligonucleotide DSP30 and IL-2. A total of 506 CLL samples were analysed with CBA and interphase FISH using probes for the detection of trisomy 12, IgH rearrangements and deletions of 6q21, 11q22.3 (ATM), 13q14 (D13S25 and D13S319) and 17p13 (TP53).

Aberrations were detected in 415 of 500 (83.0%) cases by CBA and in 392 of 500 (78.4%) cases by FISH. CBA detected 832 abnormalities and FISH only 502. Therefore, CBA offers important information in addition to FISH. (1) CLL is characterized mainly by genomic imbalances and reciprocal translocations are rare. (2) A subgroup with complex aberrant karyotype (16.4%) is identified which is associated with an unmutated IgV(H) status and CD38 expression (P=0.034 and 0.02, respectively). (3) Additional abnormalities are detectable providing new biological insights into different CLL subclasses revealing a much more heterogeneous pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities as assumed so far based on FISH data only. Therefore, prospective clinical trials should evaluate the prognostic impact of newly available CBA data.","['Haferlach, C', 'Dicker, F', 'Schnittger, S', 'Kern, W', 'Haferlach, T']","['Haferlach C', 'Dicker F', 'Schnittger S', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. claudia.haferlach@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20070906,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404935 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404935 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2442-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404935.

Indeed, aggressive forms of lymphoma constitutively produce MMP-9 and its elevated levels in the serum or in tissues correlate with advanced stage and poor patient survival. In vitro, MMP-9, which is also produced by the host peritumoral cells in response to the presence of tumors, plays an important role in migration of tumor cells through artificial basement membranes or endothelial cells. In this study, using MMP-9-deficient mice, we show that absence of MMP-9 does not prevent the development of primary T-cell leukemia. Furthermore, MMP-9-deficient cell lines retained their tumorigenic potential, as shown by their ability to induce thymic lymphoma in young syngeneic wild-type animals. In addition, these MMP-9-deficient tumor cells disseminate in normal mice, or mice that are deficient for MMP-9, indicating that tumor growth and dissemination can occur in total absence of MMP-9. These results show for the first time than lymphoma growth can occur in total absence of MMP-9 and have consequences for therapy of invasive cancers with inhibitors of MMPs.","['Roy, J-S', 'Van Themsche, C', 'Demers, M', 'Opdenakker, G', 'Arnold, B', 'St-Pierre, Y']","['Roy JS', 'Van Themsche C', 'Demers M', 'Opdenakker G', 'Arnold B', 'St-Pierre Y']","['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, University of Quebec, Laval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070906,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Mmp9 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor/transplantation', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*enzymology/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*enzymology/pathology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*enzymology/etiology/pathology']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404936 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404936 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2506-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404936.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible contribution of activated monocytes through CD40-CD40L(CD154) interactions with activated T helper cells. We demonstrated in 77 predominantly lower risk MDS patients that the CD40 receptor was expressed significantly higher on monocytes and that CD40L was expressed significantly higher on T helper cells in peripheral blood (PB) and BM. Increased levels of CD40 and CD40L were detected in the same patients. In addition, stimulation of the CD40 receptor on purified PB monocytes led to a significantly higher tumor necrosis factor alpha production in patients. Co-culture of BM mononuclear cells of 21 patients in the presence of a blocking CD40 monoclonal antibody (ch5D12) led to a significant increase in the number of colony-forming units. A correlation was seen between increased CD40 expression on monocytes with patients' age below 60 years and with the cytogenetic abnormality trisomy 8. These results demonstrate that CD40 expression on monocytes may identify a subgroup of MDS patients in whom immune-mediated hematopoietic failure is part of the disease process. As such, the CD40-CD40L-based activation of monocytes might be a target to counteract MDS-related BM failure.","['Meers, S', 'Kasran, A', 'Boon, L', 'Lemmens, J', 'Ravoet, C', 'Boogaerts, M', 'Verhoef, G', 'Verfaillie, C', 'Delforge, M']","['Meers S', 'Kasran A', 'Boon L', 'Lemmens J', 'Ravoet C', 'Boogaerts M', 'Verhoef G', 'Verfaillie C', 'Delforge M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. stef.meers@med.kuleuven.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070906,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology/*physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/*physiology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Pancytopenia/*etiology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Trisomy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404940 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404940 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2411-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404940.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study assessed the medical records of 406 patients with AL from January 1995 to December 2004. RESULTS: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 313 (77.1%) patients and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in 93 (22.9%) patients, including 241 males (59.4%) and 165 females (40.6%). Age ranged from 9 months to 15 years (average: 6.18 y). The most common presenting features were fever (18.5%), musculoskeletal diffuse tenderness (15.0%), pallor (11.4%), and leg tenderness (5.7%). Prior referral to our center, the most frequent initial diagnosis was anemia (15.8%), leukemia (15.0%), amygdalitis (3.7%), and rheumatic fever (2.7%). Osteoarticular manifestations were found on 54.7% of the patients with AL, with a higher frequency among patients between 1 and 9 years of age (58.7%, P=0.0007).

The pathogenesis relates to an imbalance of resorption over formation of bone. METHODS: Alendronate (Fosamax), an inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption, was administered for at least 6 months to 15 children with ALL during maintenance chemotherapy, after the diagnosis of osteopenia/osteoporosis by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The height velocity was also measured during the administration of alendronate and again 2 years later. RESULTS: Areal bone mineral density Z scores of the lumbar spine had a median value of -1.32 before administration of alendronate and a median gain of +0.64, with 14/15 children showing improvement. There was no adverse effect of alendronate on height velocity, and the drug was well tolerated with no short-term toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience suggests a potential value in the use of alendronate for the treatment of osteopenia/osteoporosis in children with ALL and points to the need for a randomized controlled trial of this intervention.","['Lethaby, Christopher', 'Wiernikowski, John', 'Sala, Alessandra', 'Naronha, Marissa', 'Webber, Colin', 'Barr, Ronald D']","['Lethaby C', 'Wiernikowski J', 'Sala A', 'Naronha M', 'Webber C', 'Barr RD']","[""University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom, and McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'X1J18R4W8P (Alendronate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alendronate/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphosphonates/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318142b7a1 [doi]', '00043426-200709000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2007 Sep;29(9):613-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318142b7a1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary effect of aza-C is the prohibition of cytosine methylation, which results in covalent methyltransferase-DNA (MTase-DNA) adducts at cytosine methylation sites. These adducts have been suggested to cause chromosomal rearrangements and contribute to cytotoxicity, but the detailed mechanisms have not been elucidated. We used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy to analyze plasmid pBR322 replication dynamics in Escherichia coli cells grown in the presence of aza-C. Two-dimensional gel analysis revealed the accumulation of specific bubble and Y molecules, dependent on overproduction of the cytosine MTase EcoRII (M.EcoRII) and treatment with aza-C. Furthermore, a point mutation that eliminates a particular EcoRII methylation site resulted in disappearance of the corresponding bubble and Y molecules. These results imply that aza-C-induced MTase-DNA adducts block DNA replication in vivo. RecA-dependent X structures were also observed after aza-C treatment. These molecules may be generated from blocked forks by recombinational repair and/or replication fork regression. In addition, electron microscopy analysis revealed both bubbles and rolling circles (RC) after aza-C treatment. These results suggest that replication can switch from theta to RC mode after a replication fork is stalled by an MTase-DNA adduct. The simplest model for the conversion of theta to RC mode is that the blocked replication fork is cleaved by a branch-specific endonuclease. Such replication-dependent DNA breaks may represent an important pathway that contributes to genome rearrangement and/or cytotoxicity.","['Kuo, H Kenny', 'Griffith, Jack D', 'Kreuzer, Kenneth N']","['Kuo HK', 'Griffith JD', 'Kreuzer KN']","['Department of Biochemistry, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA modification methylase EcoRII)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA-Cytosine Methylases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rec A Recombinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA-Cytosine Methylases/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Models, Biological', 'Plasmids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rec A Recombinases/physiology']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/17/8248 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1038 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 1;67(17):8248-54. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1038.,,,,,"['GM31819/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM72089/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNF5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in motility and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Here, we show that RNF5 expression is up-regulated in breast cancer tumors and related cell lines. Elevated expression of RNF5 was seen in breast cancer cell lines that became more sensitive to cytochalasin D- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis following its knockdown with specific short interfering RNA. Inhibition of RNF5 expression markedly decreased cell proliferation and caused a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to stress in MCF-7 but not in p53 mutant breast cancer cells, suggesting a p53-dependent function. Significantly, high levels of RNF5 were associated with decreased survival in human breast cancer specimens. Similarly, RNF5 levels were higher in metastatic melanoma specimens and in melanoma, leukemia, ovarian, and renal tumor-derived cell lines, suggesting that increased RNF5 expression may be a common event during tumor progression. These results indicate that RNF5 is a novel regulator of breast cancer progression through its effect on actin cytoskeletal alterations, which also affect sensitivity of breast cancer cells to cytoskeletal targeting antineoplastic agents.","['Bromberg, Kenneth D', 'Kluger, Harriet M', 'Delaunay, Agnes', 'Abbas, Sabiha', 'DiVito, Kyle A', 'Krajewski, Stan', ""Ronai, Ze'ev""]","['Bromberg KD', 'Kluger HM', 'Delaunay A', 'Abbas S', 'DiVito KA', 'Krajewski S', 'Ronai Z']","['Signal Transduction Program, The Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/17/8172 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0045 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 1;67(17):8172-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0045.,,,PMC2962863,,"['R01 CA097105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA088796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097105-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA88796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 R24 CA095823-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA095823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS170806'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic mice typically had enlarged spleens, invasion of parenchymal organs with malignant cells, and tumors with myeloid markers such as myeloperoxidase, Mac1, and Gr1. Although most leukemias were acute myeloid leukemia, many showed lymphoid features, such as CD3 staining, or clonal Tcrb or Igh gene rearrangements. Mice were clinically healthy for the first 9 months of life and had normal peripheral blood hemograms but showed impaired thymocyte differentiation, manifested by decreased CD4(+)/CD8(+) cells and increased immature CD4(-)/CD8(-) cells in the thymus. Hematopoietic tissues from both clinically healthy and leukemic CALM-AF10 mice showed up-regulation of Hoxa cluster genes, suggesting a potential mechanism for the impaired differentiation.

Therefore, identification of agents that target LSCs is an important consideration for the development of new therapies. To this end, we have previously demonstrated that the naturally occurring compound parthenolide (PTL) can induce death of human LSCs in vitro while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. However, PTL has relatively poor pharmacologic properties that limit its potential clinical use. Consequently, we generated a family of PTL analogs designed to improve solubility and bioavailability. These studies identified an analog, dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT), which induces rapid death of primary human LSCs from both myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, and is also highly cytotoxic to bulk leukemic cell populations. Molecular studies indicate the prevalent activities of DMAPT include induction of oxidative stress responses, inhibition of NF-kappaB, and activation of p53. The compound has approximately 70% oral bioavailability, and pharmacologic studies using both mouse xenograft models and spontaneous acute canine leukemias demonstrate in vivo bioactivity as determined by functional assays and multiple biomarkers.

Furthermore, c-Cbl was significantly hypophosphorylated in progressive disease, so that hypophosphorylated form of c-Cbl (c-Cbl.P) along with ZAP-70, set a cutoff ratio distributing patients with stable situation below 1, and those with progressive disease equal or above 1. Given that phospholipase gamma 2 (PLC gamma 2) function is also influenced by c-Cbl hypophosphorylation, the ratio of PLC gamma 2 to c-Cbl.P was measured in CLL B cells and consistently found to be >or= 1 in Binet stage B CLL patients, as opposed to stage A CLL patients. These findings invite analysis of the role of c-Cbl in CLL.","['Mankai, Amani', 'Eveillard, Jean-Richard', 'Buhe, Virginie', 'Le Ster, Karine', 'Loisel, Severine', 'Ghedira, Ibtissem', 'Youinou, Pierre', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Bordron, Anne']","['Mankai A', 'Eveillard JR', 'Buhe V', 'Le Ster K', 'Loisel S', 'Ghedira I', 'Youinou P', 'Berthou C', 'Bordron A']","['Research Unit Immunology and Pathology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, 5 Avenue Foch, 29609 Brest Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipase C gamma/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1107/1/193 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1381.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2007 Jun;1107:193-205. doi: 10.1196/annals.1381.021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exact relationship between alterations in apoptotic-related gene expression and clinical disease activity has not been broadly evaluated. In this study we studied peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expression of pro- and antiapoptotic genes in RRMS patients during acute relapse in comparison to patients in remission. Using cDNA Affymetrix microarrays platform (U133A2 microarrays) we analyzed the gene expression profile of PBMC derived from 22 RRMS patients in acute relapse (15 females, mean age 34.6 +/- 1.8 years, disease duration 5.6 +/- 0.8 years) in comparison to 20 sex- and age-matched RRMS patients in remission. One thousand five hundred seventy-eight gene transcripts significantly differentiated acute multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse from remission. This characteristic gene expression signature was enriched by an apoptotic-related pathway. The 1578 gene transcripts that significantly differentiated acute relapse from remission were enriched by 55 apoptotic-related genes in that reflected different operating pathways during the acute phase of the disease. These genes mainly involved the caspase-dependent pathway and included overexpression of the negative regulator of FAS-induced apoptosis (TOSO) and the BCL2 antiapoptotic family members (BCL2, BCL2 AA) as well as downexpression of proapoptotic genes like BAX, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) and caspases 1, 2, 8, 9. and 10. An additional group of antiapoptotic genes related to T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis was also found to be overexpressed in acute relapse and included TCR-binding CD3E antigen, antiapoptotic serine threonin kinase (AKT), and NF kappa B-associated genes like reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA) and human T cell leukemia virus type I-binding protein (Tax1BP) known to inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate impaired apoptotic mechanisms in peripheral lymphocytes from RRMS patients during acute relapse. This suggests that the inflammatory process in active disease is targeted by inhibition of proapoptotic and repression of antiapoptotic genes that allow prolonged abnormal immune responses.","['Achiron, Anat', 'Feldman, Anna', 'Mandel, Mathilda', 'Gurevich, Michael']","['Achiron A', 'Feldman A', 'Mandel M', 'Gurevich M']","['Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, 52621, Israel. achiron@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Acute Disease/classification', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiple Sclerosis/classification/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1107/1/155 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1381.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2007 Jun;1107:155-67. doi: 10.1196/annals.1381.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombination acceptors with at least 16 contiguous bases of donor template identity were recognized as efficiently as longer acceptors. In contrast, a sharp 1-log titer drop was observed for an acceptor of only 15 bases long, with an additional 1-log titer decline for an 8-base acceptor and further decreases for shorter acceptors. Eighty-three independent nonhomologous recombination products were sequenced to examine recombination template selection in the absence of significant sequence identity. These replication products contained a total of 152 nonhomologous crossover junctions. Forced copy choice models predict that forced nonhomologous recombination should result in DNA synthesis to the donor template's 5' end, followed by microidentity-guided acceptor template selection. However, only a single product displayed this structure. The majority of examined nonhomologous recombination products contained junction-associated sequence insertions. Most insertions resulted from the use of one or more tertiary templates, recognizable as discontiguous portions of viral or host RNA or minus-strand DNA. The donor/acceptor template microidentity evident at most crossovers reconfirmed the remarkable capability of the reverse transcription machinery to recognize short regions of sequence identity. These results demonstrate that recruitment of discontiguous host or viral sequences is a common way for retroviruses to resolve nonhomologous recombination junctions and provide experimental support for the role of splinting templates in the generation of retroviral insertions.","['Duggal, Nisha K', 'Goo, Leslie', 'King, Steven R', 'Telesnitsky, Alice']","['Duggal NK', 'Goo L', 'King SR', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20070905,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Crossing Over, Genetic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Templates, Genetic']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01591-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01591-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Nov;81(22):12156-68. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01591-07.

Therefore, monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) during treatment with imatinib is important. However, most MRD-parameters are expensive and require special technology. We determined the value of histamine as MRD-marker in CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histamine levels were measured serially in whole blood samples before and during imatinib therapy in 80 CML patients by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Histamine levels were highly upregulated in CML at diagnosis compared to healthy controls, and correlated with the presence of basophils. During treatment with imatinib, histamine levels decreased and returned to normal levels in those achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCR). Loss of CCR during therapy was invariably accompanied by an increase in histamine. Moreover, a histamine level of >100 ng/ml three or six months after start of imatinib was associated with a significantly reduced probability of survival (p<0.05). Whereas basophils were found to correlate well with histamine during imatinib, no correlations were found between histamine and Ph+ metaphases or histamine and BCR/ABL. CONCLUSION: Histamine-monitoring during treatment with imatinib is of prognostic significance.","['Agis, H', 'Sperr, W R', 'Herndlhofer, S', 'Semper, H', 'Pirc-Danoewinata, H', 'Haas, O A', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Esterbauer, H', 'Geissler, K', 'Sillaber, C', 'Jager, U', 'Valent, P']","['Agis H', 'Sperr WR', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Semper H', 'Pirc-Danoewinata H', 'Haas OA', 'Mannhalter C', 'Esterbauer H', 'Geissler K', 'Sillaber C', 'Jager U', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Center of Excellence for Clinical and Experimental Oncology (CLEXO), Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070905,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Histamine/*blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*blood/diagnosis', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/07 09:00,2008/01/17 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41140-X [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdm343 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2007 Nov;18(11):1834-41. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdm343.

F-SAP was highest in nodular sclerosis HL, and MMCC was highest in mixed cellular HL. There was a strong positive correlation between MMCC and F-SAP (Pearson Correlation test, p<0.000, r=0.51).

Here we identified the source of the basal ROS generation in NB4 cells. We demonstrated the existence of all the components of phagocytic NADPH oxidase in NB4 cells and found that this oxidase could be effectively activated. The basal ROS generation in NB4 cells could be blocked by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, but not by inhibitors of mitochondria respiratory chain, implying that NADPH oxidase played an essential role in maintaining the basal ROS level in NB4 cells. Furthermore, ATO-induced cytotoxicity was reduced by pre-treatment with DPI in NB4 cells, suggesting the involvement of NADPH oxidase in ATO-induced cytotoxicity.

It recruits Dok-1 and Dok-2, which are potent inhibitors of the Ras signalling pathway used by colony-stimulating factor (CSF) receptors. Dok-1/Dok-2 double knockout (DKO) mice develop leukaemia at 10-12 months of age. We investigated whether disturbed CD200R signalling could be responsible for this phenotype. Therefore, we studied whether CD200(-/-) mice have altered myelopoiesis and develop leukaemia. We report that CD200R is expressed on haematopoietic progenitor cells. However, CD200(-/-) mice have normal numbers of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow and these cells have normal proliferative capacity. These results indicate that the development of leukaemia in Dok-1/Dok-2 DKO mice is not solely due to an absence of CD200R signalling. In addition, we show that the previously reported enhanced numbers of myeloid cells do not occur in all CD200(-/-) mice. We determined whether variations in the numbers of peripheral myeloid cells were due to an enhanced response to granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) or an inflammatory stimulus. Mobilisation of immature neutrophils via G-CSF and infiltration of mature neutrophils and macrophages upon thioglycolate injection were not altered in CD200(-/-) mice. We conclude that CD200(-/-) mice exhibit normal myelopoiesis and that development of leukaemia in Dok-1/Dok-2 DKO mice is not caused by a lack of CD200-mediated CD200R signalling.","['Rijkers, Eva S K', 'de Ruiter, Talitha', 'Buitenhuis, Miranda', 'Veninga, Henrike', 'Hoek, Robert M', 'Meyaard, Linde']","['Rijkers ES', 'de Ruiter T', 'Buitenhuis M', 'Veninga H', 'Hoek RM', 'Meyaard L']","['Department of Immunology, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070904,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD200 receptor, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dok1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Dok2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Thioglycolates)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/deficiency', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', '*Myelopoiesis', 'Neutrophils', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/deficiency', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thioglycolates/administration & dosage']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH920 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00920.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Nov;79(5):410-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00920.x.

The expression of the protein mesothelin in hematological malignancies has not yet been analyzed. SS1(dsFv)PE38 is a recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin which is undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with mesothelin-expressing tumors. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study we show that the mesothelin protein is expressed in leukemic cells from children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This finding was confirmed by western blot, immunocytochemistry and real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Despite the expression of mesothelin, the patient samples were not sensitive to immunotoxin SS1(dsFv)PE38 in MTT assays. CONCLUSIONS: Primary AML cells express mesothelin but SS1(dsFv)PE38 is not active in killing these cells. Other approaches that utilize mesothelin as a target might be more effective and should be tested against AML cells.","['Steinbach, Daniel', 'Onda, Masanori', 'Voigt, Astrid', 'Dawczynski, Kristin', 'Wittig, Susan', 'Hassan, Raffit', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Steinbach D', 'Onda M', 'Voigt A', 'Dawczynski K', 'Wittig S', 'Hassan R', 'Gruhn B', 'Pastan I']","[""University Children's Hospital Jena, Germany.

Three types of WT1 messages (total, exon 5(+) and KTS(+)) and WT1 immunostaining of these diseases were analyzed. An increase of all three WT1 messages in high-grade MDS and acute leukemia was observed as compared with the normal control, whereas there was no significant difference in WT1 message between AA and RA, suggesting that WT1 message is not a good tool to discriminate AA and RA. No significant difference was observed between normal and RA, except for exon 5 message.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 71 allogenic and 45 autologous THSC were performed in 116 patients with different AL variants. Conditioning in all allo-THSC included busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). This regimen was used in 29 recipients of auto-HSC. Cyclophosphamide in a dose 120 mg/kg and total radiation of the body in a dose 12 Gy were given to 16 recipients. Overall, relapse-free and event-free survival of patients after THSC were analysed as well as early (first 100 days) and overall lethality. Auto-THSC in 15 patients was for the first time followed by immunomodulating therapy aimed at prevention of AL relapses: in acute myeloid leukemia ATRA in combination with alpha-interferon, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)--ronkoleukin, interleukin-2 preparation. RESULTS: Overall survival of AL patients after allo-THSC for the observation period increased from 31 to 58%, early lethality fell from 44 to 4%. Results of allo-THSC conducted in the first complete remission were much better than in patients with other AL stages at the time of THSC. After auto-THSC 5-year survival rose from 22 to 60% while early lethality reduced from 33 to 4%. Administration of immunomodulating therapy after auto-THSC increases 5-year survival from 35 to 80%. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of THSC in AL has improved for the last 20 years. Outcomes of allo-THSC performed in the first complete remission are much higher. Immunomodulating therapy after auto-THSC promoted better results.","['Savchenko, V G', 'Liubimova, L S', 'Parovichnikova, E N', 'Mendeleeva, L P', 'Mamotiuk, K S', 'Demidova, I A', 'Gribanova, E O', ""Gal'tseva, I V"", 'Pokrovskaia, O S', ""Kuz'mina, L A"", 'Zhelnova, E I', 'Kliasova, G A', 'Glasko, E N', 'Kaplanskaia, I B', 'Poreshina, L P', ""Kut'ina, R M"", 'Shpakova, A P', 'Shtareva, E M', 'Varlamova, S V', 'Kalinin, N N']","['Savchenko VG', 'Liubimova LS', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Mendeleeva LP', 'Mamotiuk KS', 'Demidova IA', 'Gribanova EO', ""Gal'tseva IV"", 'Pokrovskaia OS', ""Kuz'mina LA"", 'Zhelnova EI', 'Kliasova GA', 'Glasko EN', 'Kaplanskaia IB', 'Poreshina LP', ""Kut'ina RM"", 'Shpakova AP', 'Shtareva EM', 'Varlamova SV', 'Kalinin NN']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*mortality/*surgery/therapy', 'Male', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2007;79(7):30-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: For prognosis of the disease important are initial characteristics of the patient and the time of the tumor regress assessed by molecular methods--establishment of molecular remission and molecular recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In APL it is necessary to conduct molecular monitoring especially in patients at high risk and with poor prognosis in a decrease of treatment intensity for toxicity relief. Detection of molecular recurrence is indication for treatment. To raise efficacy of APL recurrence therapy it is necessary to design a special updated protocol.","['Samochatova, E V', 'Maschan, A A', 'Aleinikova, O V', 'Bespalova, A V', ""Baidil'dina, D D"", 'Dubrovina, M E', 'Fleishman, E V', 'Nasedkina, T V', 'Rumiantsev, S A', 'Rumiantsev, A G']","['Samochatova EV', 'Maschan AA', 'Aleinikova OV', 'Bespalova AV', ""Baidil'dina DD"", 'Dubrovina ME', 'Fleishman EV', 'Nasedkina TV', 'Rumiantsev SA', 'Rumiantsev AG']",,['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2007;79(7):26-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 1995-2002 a total of 834 patients with newly diagnosed ALL aged 0-18 years were admitted to 10 clinics of Russia. Of them, 713 were randomized in two groups: treatment program ALL-BFM 90m (n = 355) and ALL-MB 91 program (n = 358). RESULTS: In 7-year follow-up median, 10-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between the groups and was 67 +/- 3 and 68 +/- 3% (ALL-MB 91) and 74 +/- 2, 71 +/- 3% (ALL-BFM 90m), respectively. Though the rate of isolated recurrences in CNS in patients on the protocol ALL-MB 91 was 2.8%, they developed only in 0.8% patients of the standard risk group. Anemia, thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis developed less frequently, hospital stay was significantly shorter on the test protocol vs the control one (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: EFS and OS on the test (ALL-MB 91) and control (ALL-BFM 90m) protocols were equivalent in lower toxicity and cost of therapy.","['Karachunskii, A I', 'Miakova, N V', 'Rumiantseva, Iu V', 'Timakov, A M', 'Makhortykh, T Zh', 'Fechina, L G', 'Shamardina, A V', 'Dudkin, S A', 'Lebedev, V V', 'Varfolomeeva, S R', 'Timofeeva, V N', 'Herold, R', 'Stakelberg, A', 'Henze, G', 'Rumiantsev, A G']","['Karachunskii AI', 'Miakova NV', 'Rumiantseva IuV', 'Timakov AM', 'Makhortykh TZh', 'Fechina LG', 'Shamardina AV', 'Dudkin SA', 'Lebedev VV', 'Varfolomeeva SR', 'Timofeeva VN', 'Herold R', 'Stakelberg A', 'Henze G', 'Rumiantsev AG']",,['rus'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2007;79(7):19-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
