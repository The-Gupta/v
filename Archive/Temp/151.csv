Gene activity is critically determined by chromatin structure and interactions of chromatin binding proteins. Here, we show that major architectural chromatin proteins are hyperdynamic and bind loosely to chromatin in ES cells. Upon differentiation, the hyperdynamic proteins become immobilized on chromatin. Hyperdynamic binding is a property of pluripotent cells, but not of undifferentiated cells that are already lineage committed. ES cells lacking the nucleosome assembly factor HirA exhibit elevated levels of unbound histones, and formation of embryoid bodies is accelerated. In contrast, ES cells, in which the dynamic exchange of H1 is restricted, display differentiation arrest. We suggest that hyperdynamic binding of structural chromatin proteins is a functionally important hallmark of pluripotent ES cells that contributes to the maintenance of plasticity in undifferentiated ES cells and to establishing higher-order chromatin structure.","['Meshorer, Eran', 'Yellajoshula, Dhananjay', 'George, Eric', 'Scambler, Peter J', 'Brown, David T', 'Misteli, Tom']","['Meshorer E', 'Yellajoshula D', 'George E', 'Scambler PJ', 'Brown DT', 'Misteli T']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Cell,Developmental cell,101120028,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*physiology', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryonic Development/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Indoles', 'Interleukin-6/deficiency', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Biology/methods', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Protein Array Analysis/methods', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency']",,2006/01/10 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1534-5807(05)00421-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.devcel.2005.10.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Cell. 2006 Jan;10(1):105-16. doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2005.10.017.,"['Z01 BC010309-07/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Hira protein, mouse)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",['Dev Cell. 2006 Jan;10(1):1-2.

A characteristic temporal relation between fludarabine therapy and the appearance of a warm-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated AIHA in patients with CLL has been observed and, in some, the AIHA has been fatal. Whether both fludarabine and cladribine cause AIHA is uncertain because AIHA is commonly seen in patients with CLL without the use of these drugs. In contrast, AIHA is encountered in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) much less frequently, and the autoantibody is usually cold-reactive and IgM-mediated. In a few reported cases of AIHA arising in patients with WM after cladribine therapy, there was a latency of 24 to 60 months between therapy and the onset of AIHA, three of which were warm-reactive and IgG-mediated. CASE REPORT: A warm-reacting IgG red cell autoantibody and evidence of hemolysis detected 1 month after completing cladribine therapy for WM, with warm antibody AIHA developing 4 months later, are described. CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine, like fludarabine, is possibly able to produce this complication during or early after therapy. Because the use of purine analogs is becoming increasingly common, it is important to have an awareness of the complications that can arise during and after treatment. Further observations of warm AIHA during cladribine therapy are needed to establish it as a distinct complication.","['Aslan, Deniz L', 'Peterson, Bruce A', 'Long-Tsai, Michaela', 'Eastlund, Ted']","['Aslan DL', 'Peterson BA', 'Long-Tsai M', 'Eastlund T']","['Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. east1002@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*chemically induced/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*agonists', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Hemolysis/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/complications/*drug therapy/immunology']",,2006/01/10 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF00678 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00678.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2006 Jan;46(1):90-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00678.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 5-8% of cases with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) carry the p53 mutation. Recently, the compound p53-dependent reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis (PRIMA-1) has been shown to induce cytotoxic effects and apoptosis in human tumour cells by restoration of the transcriptional activity of mutated p53. This is believed to be mediated by a change in the conformation of mutated p53 protein, restoring DNA binding and activation of p53 target genes. We studied the effects of PRIMA-1 and commonly used antileukaemic drugs on AML cells from 62 patients. Cells were obtained from peripheral blood or bone marrow and were exposed to PRIMA-1, cytarabine, daunorubicin, chlorodeoxyadenosine and fludarabine. This study showed that PRIMA-1 had cytotoxic effects on AML cells. Conventional AML drugs were less effective in cells with hemizygous p53 deletion. Interestingly, our data indicated that PRIMA-1 was more effective in this subgroup of patients compared with patients with normal chromosome 17. Our data suggest that the concept of restoration of p53 protein by PRIMA-1 or a PRIMA-1-based new drug may increase the efficacy of AML treatment in patients with p53 mutations.","['Nahi, H', 'Merup, M', 'Lehmann, S', 'Bengtzen, S', 'Mollgard, L', 'Selivanova, G', 'Wiman, K G', 'Paul, C']","['Nahi H', 'Merup M', 'Lehmann S', 'Bengtzen S', 'Mollgard L', 'Selivanova G', 'Wiman KG', 'Paul C']","['Department of Haematology, Karolinska University Hospital at Huddinge, Sweden. hareth.nahi@karolinska.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aza Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/01/10 09:00,2006/02/07 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5851 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05851.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Jan;132(2):230-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05851.x.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aza Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'GHC34M30BG (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1-azabicyclo(2,2,2,)octan-3-one)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost all TLX1(+) T-ALLs exhibit a CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) phenotype. To investigate the role of TLX1 as an initiating oncogene in T-ALL pathogenesis, we assessed the consequences of retroviral vector-directed TLX1 expression during the differentiation of murine and human thymocytes in fetal thymic organ cultures. Interestingly, enforced expression of TLX1 disrupted the differentiation of murine fetal liver precursors and human cord blood CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells prior to the DP thymocyte stage. Although differentiation arrest was associated with an increased percentage of apoptotic thymocytes, it could only be partially bypassed by coexpression of transgenic BCL2. Mutation of the invariant asparagine residue at position 51 of the homeodomain - which is required for efficient DNA binding - released the block, consistent with the notion that TLX1 inhibits thymocyte differentiation and promotes T-cell oncogenesis by functioning as a transcription factor. The relevance of these findings is discussed in the context of activating NOTCH1 mutations and the other genetic lesions implicated in the multistep transformation process of TLX1(+) T-ALL.","['Owens, Bronwyn M', 'Hawley, Teresa S', 'Spain, Lisa M', 'Kerkel, Kristi A', 'Hawley, Robert G']","['Owens BM', 'Hawley TS', 'Spain LM', 'Kerkel KA', 'Hawley RG']","['Graduate Program in Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Genes, bcl-2/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2006/01/10 09:00,2006/02/07 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5850 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05850.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Jan;132(2):216-29. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05850.x.,"['R01HL65519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24RR16209/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066305-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL065519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 RR016209/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL66305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",,,PMC2431114,['NIHMS51706'],,,,,,,,,,,

Anagrelide is well established as an effective platelet-lowering agent in most patients with essential thrombocythaemia, including both treatment-naive patients and those refractory to other cytoreductive therapy. Results of the only randomised trial to date (the Primary Thrombocythaemia 1 [PT1] study) indicated that the composite primary endpoint (arterial or venous thrombosis, serious haemorrhage or death from vascular causes) occurred more often in recipients of anagrelide plus aspirin than in those receiving hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) plus aspirin. This trial also indicated that the incidence of the secondary endpoints transient ischaemic attack and gastrointestinal bleeding favoured hydroxycarbamide plus aspirin, while the incidence of venous thrombosis favoured anagrelide plus aspirin. There were no differences between the groups in the incidence of secondary endpoints myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, pulmonary embolism, hepatic-vein thrombosis, other serious haemorrhage or related deaths. The design of the PT1 study has been queried with respect to the heterogeneous nature of the study population (possible inclusion of patients with early myelofibrotic disease) and the concomitant use of aspirin (interaction with anagrelide causing increased bleeding events). Further data are therefore required before the role of anagrelide in essential thrombocythaemia can be finalized. In the meantime, when considering treatment options for patients with this disorder, anagrelide's positive effects on platelet function, lack of mutagenicity and lack of association with leukaemia or angiogenesis must be balanced against its comparative expense and positive inotropic effects. Thus, the role of anagrelide in the management of high-risk patients with essential thrombocythaemia will ultimately depend on individual patient assessment and future clarification of the potential leukaemogenicity of hydroxycarbamide.","['Wagstaff, Antona J', 'Keating, Gillian M']","['Wagstaff AJ', 'Keating GM']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Hematologic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Platelet Count', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/*drug therapy']",69,2006/01/10 09:00,2006/03/02 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['6616 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200666010-00006 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2006;66(1):111-31. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200666010-00006.,,"['0 (Hematologic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The porphyrins inhibited protein and RNA synthesis in a dose dependent pattern. Exposure of leukemic cells to 15 microM hemin for 10 min reduced leucine incorporation to less than 20%, and 78% of the cells were freely permeable to trypan blue. Hemin at 0.17 microM had to be bound to 10(6) cells in the dark to produce this killing effect. On the other hand, the control lymphocytes from 20 healthy subjects were relatively resistant to the hemin effect, and cell damage was reversible. Fetal calf serum (FCS) protected most leukemic lymphocytes from prophyrin toxicity. The combination of human hemoglobin with free protoporphyrin showed a synergistic toxicity, and this combination was the most potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in the presence of serum. 55Fe-hemin was preferentially bound to leukemic lymphocytes, and the binding site of protoporphyrin was observed to be on the cell surface membrane. The hemin quenching effect of diphenyl hexatriene (DPH) stained cell fluorescence indicated that hemin was apparently bound to the lipid layer of the outer membrane.

We report a nine-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and subsequently developed a left subclavian artery aneurysm. Prior to the aneurysm, computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a nodule with an air crescent in the left upper lobe, adhering to the mediastinum and the left subclavian artery. The left subclavian artery was ill-defined and had a small lumen, and it was embedded in the wall of the nodule. 37 days after the chest CT, the patient underwent a left thoracotomy because of massive haemoptysis, at which time a false aneurysm in the left subclavian artery was found. Plication of the aneurysm was performed. On a follow-up CT with multiplanar reconstruction six days after surgery, there were the plicated aneurysm and a small amount of pleural effusion in the upper portion of the left hemithorax, adjacent to the plication. In invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, it is important to be aware of the possibility of mycotic aneurysms, particularly in patients with pulmonary lesions adjacent to mediastinal vessels with ill-defined borders and small lumens, since the aneurysms may increase in size and rupture.

This study looks at the role of computed tomography (CT) in evaluating focal splenic lesions in patients presenting with fever. METHODS: 37 patients presenting with fever of unknown origin underwent CT and this study retrospectively analyses the findings in these patients. 13 patients also had associated abdominal pain. Patients with conditions at high risk for splenic infection include: diabetes mellitus in ten patients, leukaemia in seven patients, human immunodeficiency virus infection in five patients, intravenous drug abuse in six patients, and steroid therapy in two patients. No risk factors could be identified in seven patients. RESULTS: Splenic abscess was diagnosed in 28 patients. A range of infecting organisms was isolated but the most frequent were Staphylococcus aureus (eight), tuberculosis (four), Streptococcus (four), fungal (four) and melioidosis (four). No infecting organism could be identified in ten cases though in patients with leukaemia with multiple low attenuation areas, the cause was presumed to be fungal. Six patients were diagnosed to have splenic infarcts though differentiation from splenic abscess could be difficult; these patients were treated for an abscess and all had endocarditis. Three patients were subsequently diagnosed with lymphoma. Percutaneous abscess drainage was performed in five patients and splenectomy was carried out in six patients. CONCLUSION: CT proved to be very useful as it not only revealed the size and extent of any splenic abnormality but it assisted with guidance for percutaneous drainage, determined the site for biopsy, and provided follow-up after treatment.","['Joazlina, Z Y', 'Wastie, M L', 'Ariffin, N']","['Joazlina ZY', 'Wastie ML', 'Ariffin N']","['Department of Radiology, University of Malaya Medical Centre, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. joazliniazy@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,IM,"['Abscess/complications/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Spleen/*diagnostic imaging/microbiology/pathology', 'Splenic Diseases/complications/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2006 Jan;47(1):37-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the potential usefulness of two novel synthetic ceramide analogs as anti-leukemic drugs was investigated. Compounds AD2646 and AD2687 were able to dose-and time-dependently decrease the viability of Jurkat leukemic cells. This was accompanied by an accumulation of endogenous ceramide owing to perturbed ceramide metabolism. Cytotoxicity involved caspase activation but also necrotic-like features, as evidenced by phosphatidylserine externalization, membrane permeability, hypodiploidy, caspase processing and only partial protection from cell death by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Ceramide analogs also induced cell death in Jurkat mutants that are deficient in cell death signaling proteins, including FADD, caspase-8 and 10, and RIP. While overexpression of Bcl-xL did not suppress ceramide accumulation, it conferred robust protection from caspase activation and cell death. Altogether, these novel ceramide analogs are able to kill leukemic cells through distinct pathways implicating caspase activation and mitochondrial events, and represent a new group of bioactive molecules with potential applications in anticancer therapy.","['Granot, T', 'Milhas, D', 'Carpentier, S', 'Dagan, A', 'Segui, B', 'Gatt, S', 'Levade, T']","['Granot T', 'Milhas D', 'Carpentier S', 'Dagan A', 'Segui B', 'Gatt S', 'Levade T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'bcl-X Protein/physiology']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404084 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404084 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):392-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404084.,,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased level of apoptosis has been observed on treatment of human B-CLL cells with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, suggesting that this family of protein kinases mediate survival signals within B-CLL cells. Therefore, to investigate the ability of individual PKC isoforms to transform developing B cells, we stably expressed plasmids encoding PKC mutants in fetal liver-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) from wild-type mice and then cultured them in B-cell generation systems in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, we noted that expression of a plasmid-encoding dominant-negative PKC alpha (PKC alpha-KR) in HPCs and subsequent culture both in vitro and in vivo resulted in the generation of a population of cells that displayed an enhanced proliferative capacity over untransfected cells and phenotypically resemble human B-CLL cells. In the absence of growth factors and stroma, these B-CLL-like cells undergo cell cycle arrest and, consistent with their ability to escape growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis, exhibited elevated levels of Bcl-2 expression. These studies therefore identify a unique oncogenic trigger for the development of a B-CLL-like disease resulting from the subversion of PKC alpha signaling. Our findings uncover novel avenues not only for the study of the induction of leukemic B cells but also for the development of therapeutic drugs to combat PKC alpha-regulated transformation events.","['Nakagawa, Rinako', 'Soh, Jae Won', 'Michie, Alison M']","['Nakagawa R', 'Soh JW', 'Michie AM']","['Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammation, Western Infirmary, University of Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/1/527 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0841 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 1;66(1):527-34. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0841.,,['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type (WT) KIT and certain mutant KIT isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating patients with metastatic GIST. However, KIT activation loop mutations involving codon D816 that are typically found in AML, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to imatinib mesylate (IC50 > 5-10 micromol/L), and acquired KIT activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib mesylate resistance in GIST. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825) is a small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of SRC and ABL tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar range. Some small-molecule SRC/ABL inhibitors also have potency against WT KIT kinase. Therefore, we hypothesized that dasatinib might inhibit the kinase activity of both WT and mutant KIT isoforms. We report herein that dasatinib potently inhibits WT KIT and juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. Furthermore, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant KIT activation loop mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against KIT D816Y >> D816F > D816V). Our studies suggest that dasatinib may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that are associated with gain-of-function KIT mutations.","['Schittenhelm, Marcus M', 'Shiraga, Sharon', 'Schroeder, Arin', 'Corbin, Amie S', 'Griffith, Diana', 'Lee, Francis Y', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Deininger, Michael W N', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Heinrich, Michael C']","['Schittenhelm MM', 'Shiraga S', 'Schroeder A', 'Corbin AS', 'Griffith D', 'Lee FY', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ', 'Heinrich MC']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Dasatinib', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/1/473 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2050 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 1;66(1):473-81. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2050.,['P30 CA69533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the contribution of NF-kappaB in carcinogenesis, a novel approach that interferes with its activity might have therapeutic potential against cancers that respond poorly to conventional treatments. Here, we have shown that a new IkappaB kinase beta inhibitor, IMD-0354, suppressed the growth of human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, HMC1-8, and MCF-7, by arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a reporter assay, IMD-0354 abolished the NF-kappaB activity in MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In the cells incubated with IMD-0354, cell cycle arrested at the G0-G1 phase and apoptotic cells were increased. The expression of some cell cycle regulatory molecules and antiapoptotic molecules was suppressed in cells treated with IMD-0354. On the other hand, cyclin-dependent kinase suppressor p27Kip1 was up-regulated by the addition of IMD-0354. Daily administration of IMD-0354 inhibited tumor expansion in immunodeficient mice into which MDA-MB-231 cells were transplanted. These results indicate that NF-kappaB may contribute to cell proliferation through up-regulation of cell cycle progression; accordingly, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity might have a therapeutic ability in the treatment of human breast cancers.","['Tanaka, Akane', 'Muto, Susumu', 'Konno, Masayo', 'Itai, Akiko', 'Matsuda, Hiroshi']","['Tanaka A', 'Muto S', 'Konno M', 'Itai A', 'Matsuda H']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Molecular Pathology and Therapeutics, Division of Animal Science, Graduate School, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/1/419 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0741 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 1;66(1):419-26. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0741.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '76145IS906 (N-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a series of carcinoma cell lines, the IC50 for proliferation ranged from 120 nmol/L (Colo205) to >8.5 micromol/L (OV202). The addition of stimulatory ligands was unnecessary for the antiproliferative effect in MCF-7 and OV202 cells. BMS-554417 treatment inhibited IGF-IR and insulin receptor signaling through extracellular signal-related kinase as well as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, as evidenced by decreased Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. At doses that inhibited proliferation, the compound also caused a G0-G1 arrest and prevented nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 in response to LR3 IGF-I. In Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells, this agent triggered apoptotic cell death via the mitochondrial pathway. BMS-554417 was orally bioavailable and significantly inhibited the growth of IGF1R-Sal tumor xenografts in vivo.

Our recent study showed that the absence of the CDK inhibitor p18(INK4C) (p18) enhances self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) in vivo, whereas previous studies by others showed an increased incidence of leukemogenesis in older p18-null mice. Here, we have examined potential leukemogenesis during experimentally induced regeneration of HSC in the absence of p18 in order to gauge the relation between these two processes. Reconstituted mice with p18-deficient HSCs under the condition of repetitive proliferative stress (serial transplantation) were followed for >3 years. T cell leukemia from the p18-/- origin was recapitulated 24 months after secondary transplantation. However, no myeloid leukemia was found in the recipients. The T cell leukemia-initiating cells (mainly in a CD3(lo) cell subset) did not share the same immunophenotype with normal HSCs and, in fact, the function of HSCs was significantly compromised with decreased abundance in the leukemic mice. Furthermore, we found that the p15 or p16 gene promoters were frequently methylated in the leukemic cells but not in HSCs. Our present study argues against the possibility of overgrowth of p18-null HSCs leading to a leukemic phenotype. The data also support the notion that p18 has an independent role in T cell maintenance such that CD3+ CD8+ cells, unlike HSCs, are more accessible to leukemogenic transformation after the loss of p18.","['Yuan, Youzhong', 'Yu, Hui', 'Boyer, Matthew J', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Cao, Shaonan', 'Shen, Hongmei', 'Cheng, Tao']","['Yuan Y', 'Yu H', 'Boyer MJ', 'Song X', 'Cao S', 'Shen H', 'Cheng T']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/*deficiency/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/1/343 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2945 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 1;66(1):343-51. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2945.,"['DK02761/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL70561/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter methylation of CpG target sites or direct deletions/insertions of genes are mechanisms of a reversible or permanent silencing of gene expression, respectively. Therefore, we investigated whether IRF-4 promoter methylation or mutation may be involved in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells. Whereas promoter mutations or structural rearrangements could be excluded as a cause of altered IRF-4 expression in hematopoietic cells, the IRF-4 promoter methylation status was found to significantly influence IRF-4 transcription. First, treatment of IRF-4-negative lymphoid, myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation-inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase of IRF-4 mRNA and protein levels. Second, using a restriction-PCR-assay and bisulfite-sequencing we identified specifically methylated CpG sites in IRF-4-negative but not in IRF-4-positive cells. Third, we clearly determined promoter methylation as a mechanism for IRF-4 down-regulation via reporter gene assays, but did not detect an association of methylational status and mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases or methyl-CpG-binding proteins. Together, these data suggest CpG site-specific IRF-4 promoter methylation as a putative mechanism of down-regulated IRF-4 expression in leukemia.","['Ortmann, Christina A', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Holzle, Katharina', 'Nitsche, Andreas', 'Wittig, Burghardt', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Schmidt, Manuel']","['Ortmann CA', 'Burchert A', 'Holzle K', 'Nitsche A', 'Wittig B', 'Neubauer A', 'Schmidt M']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie and Immunologie, Zentrum Innere Medizin, Klinikum der Philipps-Universitat, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/01/26 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['33/21/6895 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gki1001 [doi]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Dec 7;33(21):6895-905. doi: 10.1093/nar/gki1001.

We present a rare example of a histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma manifested by prolymphocytoid morphology and an unusual immunophenotype characterized by coexpression of CD5 and CD10. The transformed prolymphocytoid lymphoma was positive for CD5 and CD10 antigens by both flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The case also expressed bcl-2 and bcl-6 proteins, and exhibited t(14;18), consistent with derivation from a pre-existing follicular lymphoma. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain genes derived from the follicular lymphoma and prolymphocytoid lymphoma showed identical rearranged bands, suggesting clonal identity of the two neoplasms. The basis for coexpression of CD5 and CD10 remains unclear. Because the preceding low-grade follicular lymphoma was positive only for CD10 and did not express CD5, CD5 expression appears to be an acquired phenomenon accompanying the process of histologic transformation in this particular case. Prolymphocytoid transformation, similar to other histologic forms of transformation of follicular lymphoma, appears to accompany clinical progression of disease.","['Lau, Sean K', 'Weiss, Lawrence M', 'Zhang, Yibin', 'Huang, Qin']","['Lau SK', 'Weiss LM', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang Q']","['Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. slau@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'CD5 Antigens/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Neprilysin/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Failure']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['U58427537003714M [pii]', '10.1080/10520290500305310 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Mar;47(3):541-7. doi: 10.1080/10520290500305310.,,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies performed in vitro have demonstrated that ATO also induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in multiple cancers, including non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the potential use of ATO on non-APL AML, we treated the leukemic cells in vivo using a NOD/SCID animal model. Mice harboring HL-60 or NB-4 leukemia or primary AML-M2 cells were treated daily with 5 mug/g ATO intraperitoneally for a maximum of 6 weeks. Although ATO initially appeared to be effective on HL-60 cells, it failed to decrease the leukemic cells in bone marrow (BM) after the extended treatment (52.2 +/- 10.7% vs. 62.2 +/- 2.6% in the controls; P = 0.51); whereas the same treatment to NB-4 leukemic mice significantly decreased the percentage of leukemic cells in BM. ATO also failed to eradicate the primary AML cells in vivo. The reason for the treatment failure was that HL-60 cells quickly developed resistance in vivo. The drug resistance could be partly attributable to the increase of cellular glutathione as a result of compensatory response to ATO treatment because depletion of glutathione with buthionine sulfoximine reversed the drug resistance in vitro. Meanwhile, BM stromal cells also contributed to the drug resistance. Leukemic cells grown on an adherent layer of MS-5 stromal cells in the presence of ATO were more proliferative and less apoptotic and had increased expression cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and decreased expression of p21, likely protecting the leukemic cells from ATO cytotoxicity. Therefore, our study suggests that strategies to inhibit the compensatory increase of glutathione and block the interaction between leukemic cells and BM stromal cells should be employed before applying ATO to non-APL hematologic malignancies.","['Lee, Chincheng', 'Lin, Yiyin', 'Huang, Mingjer', 'Lin, Chepin', 'Liu, Chienru', 'Chow, Jyhming', 'Liu, H Eugene']","['Lee C', 'Lin Y', 'Huang M', 'Lin C', 'Liu C', 'Chow J', 'Liu HE']","['Department of Pathology, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Glutathione/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Treatment Failure']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['H12262778PJ87726 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500305851 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Mar;47(3):521-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190500305851.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal bone marrow, the anti-VEGF antibody was found to react with myeloid progenitor cells, immature monocytic cells, plasma cells and megakaryocytes, but not with erythroid cells or mature granulocytic cells. Higher levels of VEGF were found in patients with MDS, subtypes RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML, compared to patients with RA or RARS, or the normal bone marrow. These differences were found to result from expression of VEGF in immature myeloid cells in RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML. The microvessel density was also higher in patients with RAEB-T and CMML compared to RA and RARS or the normal bone marrow. Expression of VEGF mRNA was demonstrable in isolated neoplastic cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all patients examined.

Previous research showed that, while normal bone marrow cells lack expression of renin, myeloid blasts have been reported to do so. The aim was to study the expression of the renin gene by the use of real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) at diagnosis in acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML) and to assess its possible relevance in the prognosis and outcome of such patients. This study analysed 76 samples from patients with AML, with follow-up of positive patients. Thirty-one patients (41%) were positive for renin gene expression at diagnosis. All renin-positive patients at diagnosis showed no expression during complete remission (CR), but expression recurred in those experiencing relapse and persisted when the disease was refractory to treatment. Although the results suggest that the sub-group of renin-positive AML patients might have a worse outcome and a higher relapse rate (at 5 years, the projected rate of disease-free survival was 18.5 +/- 9.8% for renin-positive and 23.5 +/- 8.8% for renin-negative patients), no significant differences were found.

CC in CML has also been effectively used for monitoring the response to drug therapy. However, this particular laboratory test misses submicroscopic BCR/ABL translocations and is suboptimal for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment. Both fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) feature higher sensitivity in terms of both diagnosis and MRD assessment in CML, compared to CC. Another advantage of these alternative tests is their effective applicability to peripheral blood specimens. The current review highlights the practical literature with respect to the use of FISH for CML whereas the use of RT-PCR has been extensively covered in recent communications.","['Landstrom, Andrew P', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Landstrom AP', 'Tefferi A']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",65,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['G833138XV761U316 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500353133 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Mar;47(3):397-402. doi: 10.1080/10428190500353133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrospective clinico-pathological evaluations conducted in the meantime, as well as the detection of new biomarkers, may aid in testing the validity of these new criteria. Based on a large series of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an analysis of bone marrow (BM) features and risk classifications revealed that the fiber content exerted a most important and independent impact on prognosis. This finding was also supported in a prospective randomized study and therefore myelofibrosis should be included in any staging system in CML related to survival. Moreover, it is important to emphasize the dynamics of the disease process in MPDs, especially in polycythemia vera (PV) and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). Latent-stage PV is difficult to recognize when adhering to the proposed limits for hemoglobin (or red cell mass) without regarding the erythropoietin (EPO) level, endogenous erythroid colonies (EECs) or BM histopathology. Initial PV may firstly present with complications and, when accompanied by a high platelet count, mimics essential thrombocythemia (ET). Consequently, BM morphology and EPO level should be entered as major diagnostic criteria for PV. To document more accurately the progress of disease, a simplified scoring system concerning myelofibrosis has to be included in the histological description of CIMF. The diagnostic guidelines of BM features in ET should be improved because, usually, there is neither a significant proliferation nor left-shifting of the granulo- and erythropoiesis detectable and no relevant increase in reticulin. A comparison of clinical data and BM morphology reveals that biomarkers (EPO, EECs, PRV-1, JAK2) show an overlapping pattern of positivity between the different subtypes of MPDs.","['Thiele, Juergen', 'Kvasnicka, Hans M']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM']","['Institute of Pathology, University Cologne, Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/classification/diagnosis/pathology', '*World Health Organization']",181,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['M020973GU3053T66 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500331329 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Mar;47(3):381-96. doi: 10.1080/10428190500331329.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physicians must adopt specific communication skills to engage families in open dialogue from the outset in order to elicit truly shared informed consent. Starting from the case of a family with an only child affected by disseminated neuroblastoma, we wish to comment on the problems surfacing in the informed consent process for treatment and research in pediatric oncology that implicate an understanding of bioethical issues and psychological principles. Although the outcome of childhood cancer has improved dramatically over the last 30 years, with overall survival rates now exceeding 70%, there are regretfully still types and stages of cancer carrying a very high risk of death that urgently require new clinical strategies. The response to this need has been the design of experimental protocols that often entail randomized controlled trials (RCT). A large number of these trials concern stage IV neuroblastoma, acute leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, and other types of childhood cancers presenting great heterogeneity both in terms of localization and responsiveness to therapy. Most trials for disease relapses also include one or more randomizations. The scientific motivation justifying an RCT is the need to compare and evaluate an innovative protocol (or part thereof) with reference treatment modalities. Nevertheless, the process brings to bear the ethical dilemma of having to weigh the needs of the single afflicted child against the benefit which may ensue for a much larger patient community.","['Massimo, Luisa M', 'Wiley, Thomas J']","['Massimo LM', 'Wiley TJ']","[""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit G.Gaslini Children's Research Hospital, Largo Gerolamo Gaslini, 5, I-16147 Genova, Italy. luisamassimo@ospedale-gaslini.ge.it""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,IM,"['Child, Preschool', '*Communication', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent/ethics/psychology', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Professional-Family Relations', '*Random Allocation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,2006/01/07 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2006/01/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2005 Dec;92(12):E67-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple proteins interact with bcl-2 mRNA in HL-60 (human leukaemia-60) cells, potentially contributing to the overexpression of Bcl-2 protein. Treatment of HL-60 cells with taxol or okadaic acid has been shown to induce destabilization of bcl-2 mRNA, which was associated with decreased binding of trans-acting factors to bcl-2 mRNA. Nucleolin has been identified as one of the bcl-2 mRNA-binding proteins [Sengupta, Bandyopadhyay, Fernandes and Spicer (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 10855-10863]. In an effort to identify additional bcl-2 mRNA-binding proteins, two polypeptides of approx. 45 kDa and 60 kDa were isolated from HL-60 cells by ARE(bcl-2) (transcripts that contain bcl-2 AREs) RNA affinity chromatography. These proteins were identified as the human proliferation associated protein, Ebp1, and human DRBP76 (double stranded RNA-binding protein 76) respectively, by MALDI (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization)-MS. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that recombinant Ebp1 binds to ARE(bcl-2) RNA but not to the group 1 ARE present in GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor) mRNA in vitro. Antibody supershift assays demonstrated that Ebp1 is present in protein-ARE(bcl-2) RNA complexes formed with cytosolic HL-60 extracts. The interaction of Ebp1 with bcl-2 mRNA in HL-60 cells was also demonstrated by RNA co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction was not detected in extracts of taxol-treated HL-60 cells. Immunoprecipitation assays further revealed that Ebp1 co-precipitates with nucleolin from HL-60 cytoplasmic extracts. The observation that co-precipitation was decreased when extracts were treated with RNase suggests that Ebp1 and nucleolin are present in the same bcl-2 mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein particle) complexes. RNA-decay assays further demonstrated that Ebp1 decreased the rate of decay of beta-globin-ARE(bcl-2) transcripts in HL-60 cell extracts. Collectively, these results indicate a novel function for Ebp1 in contributing to the regulation of bcl-2 expression in HL-60 cells.","['Bose, Sudeep K', 'Sengupta, Tapas K', 'Bandyopadhyay, Sumita', 'Spicer, Eleanor K']","['Bose SK', 'Sengupta TK', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Spicer EK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, P.O.

We have shown that carnosic acid, the major rosemary polyphenol, enhances the differentiating and antiproliferative effects of low concentrations of 1,25D(3) in human myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL60, U937). Here we translated these findings to in vivo conditions using a syngeneic mouse leukemia tumor model. To this end, we first demonstrated that as in HL60 cells, differentiation of WEHI-3B D(-) murine myelomonocytic leukemia cells induced by 1 nM 1,25D(3) or its low-calcemic analog, 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-5,6-trans-cholecalciferol (Ro25-4020), can be synergistically potentiated by carnosic acid (10 microM) or the carnosic acid-rich ethanolic extract of rosemary leaves. This effect was accompanied by cell cycle arrest in G0 + G1 phase and a marked inhibition of cell growth. In the in vivo studies, i.p. injections of 2 microg Ro25-4020 in Balb/c mice bearing WEHI-3B D(-) tumors produced a significant delay in tumor appearance and reduction in tumor size, without significant toxicity. Another analog, 1,25-dihydroxy-16,23Z-diene-20-epi-26,27-hexafluoro-19-nor-cholecalciferol (Ro26-3884) administered at the same dose was less effective than Ro25-4020 and profoundly toxic. Importantly, combined treatment with 1% dry rosemary extract (mixed with food) and 1 microg Ro25-4020 resulted in a strong cooperative antitumor effect, without inducing hypercalcemia. These results indicate for the first time that a plant polyphenolic preparation and a vitamin D derivative can cooperate not only in inducing leukemia cell differentiation in vitro, but also in the antileukemic activity in vivo. These data may suggest novel protocols for chemoprevention or differentiation therapy of myeloid leukemia.","['Sharabani, Hagar', 'Izumchenko, Eugene', 'Wang, Qing', 'Kreinin, Rita', 'Steiner, Michael', 'Barvish, Zeev', 'Kafka, Michael', 'Sharoni, Yoav', 'Levy, Joseph', 'Uskokovic, Milan', 'Studzinski, George P', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Sharabani H', 'Izumchenko E', 'Wang Q', 'Kreinin R', 'Steiner M', 'Barvish Z', 'Kafka M', 'Sharoni Y', 'Levy J', 'Uskokovic M', 'Studzinski GP', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Abietanes/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cholecalciferol/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Plant Preparations/pharmacology', 'Polyphenols', '*Rosmarinus', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21736 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Jun 15;118(12):3012-21. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21736.,"['R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 44722-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-18A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (1,25-dihydroxy-16,23-diene vitamin D3)', '0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,PMC2824511,['NIHMS170306'],,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

In addition, the value of serial screening for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis was assessed. PROCEDURE: A total of 98 consecutive high-risk pediatric patients were prospectively surveyed for signs of IFI and weekly monitored for serum GM. The data was not made available to treating physicians. RESULTS: Only 2 patients had proven and 27 possible IFI based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group definitions. The incidence of proven IFI was 1/31 (3.2%) in the allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) (Aspergillus spp), 0/26 in the autologous SCT, and 1/60 (1.6%) in the induction therapy group (C. krusei). GM was detected at least in one tested sample in 12/98 patients (12.2%), in five patients in two or more sequential samples. In the latter group, IFI was proven in one patient and could not be excluded in the others. Four of the five patients belonged to the 31 allogeneic and one to the 26 autologous SCT patients. In patients with only one positive GM test none developed signs of IFI and only one received empirical amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: With the currently used preventative and prophylactic measures, IFI is uncommon in children with high-risk for infection. Regular screening for GM could be useful among allogeneic SCT patients and two positive samples should prompt further investigative procedures and pre-emptive antifungal therapy.","['Hovi, Liisa', 'Saxen, Harri', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Meri, Taru', 'Richardson, Malcolm']","['Hovi L', 'Saxen H', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Vettenranta K', 'Meri T', 'Richardson M']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. liisa.hovi@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Aspergillosis/blood/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Mannans/blood', '*Monitoring, Physiologic', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/mortality/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20717 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jan;48(1):28-34. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20717.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The erythrocyte levels of metabolites reflect the intensity of therapy. Whether they are associated with hepatotoxicity manifested as histological liver changes is not known. We studied the association of the metabolites and cumulative doses of 6MP and MTX with histological liver disease. METHODS: Serial measurements of E-TGN, E-MTX, and ALT during maintenance therapy were performed and cumulative doses of 6MP and MTX were calculated as g/m2 in 16 children with ALL. Each subject underwent a percutaneous liver biopsy at the end of therapy to screen for histological liver disease. RESULTS: No differences in E-TGN, E-MTX, or cumulative doses of 6MP or MTX were detected in the children with ALL with liver fibrosis compared to those without fibrosis, or in the children with less liver fatty change compared to those with more fatty change. Serum median ALT levels correlated significantly positively with cumulative doses of 6MP during therapy (rS = 0.527, P = 0.036), but not with cumulative doses of MTX, or E-TGN, or E-MTX. CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte levels of the metabolites or the cumulative doses of 6MP and MTX do not predict histological liver disease in children treated for ALL.","['Halonen, Paivi', 'Mattila, Jorma', 'Makipernaa, Anne', 'Ruuska, Tarja', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Halonen P', 'Mattila J', 'Makipernaa A', 'Ruuska T', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Paediatric Research Centre, Medical School, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland. paivi.halonen@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*blood/etiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis/blood/chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20442 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Jun;46(7):762-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20442.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

We also confirmed that MCTF significantly increases annexin V(+)/propidium iodide-cells using FACS analysis. MCTF treatment activated caspase-8, -9 and -3, and led to cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and release of cytochrome c into cytosol in a concentration-dependent manner, while MCTF did not affect Bax or Bcl-2 protein levels as shown by Western blot analysis.

METHODS: Data from 1307 NHLs (excluding primary cutaneous lymphomas and monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance) were obtained. Current status was available for all patients. Except for 29 cases of small lymphocytic (CLL/SLL), lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and myeloma (MM), which were diagnosed cytologically, diagnoses were reclassified on paraffin wax embedded archival material according to new World Health Organisation criteria. Sex specific age adjusted standardised incidence rates were computed using Segi's population weighting. Annual incidence changes were calculated by weighted least square regression analysis. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log rank test. RESULTS: NHL more frequently affected men (male/female ratio, 1.52). Mean age of occurrence was 61 and 66 years for men and women, respectively. The incidence rate of 14.3 remained constant. There was a significant increase in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and decrease in CLL/SLL in men, and a decrease in MM in women. Overall DSS was 64% during the mean follow up (43 months). Age, T-NHL, lambda light chain restriction in MM, and male sex in CLL/SLL were associated with poor prognosis. In B-NHL, DSS decreased in the following order: hairy cell leukaemia, marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, ALL, DLBCL, CLL, MM, and mantle cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NHL in Tyrol has changed in the past decade, with a significant increase in DLBCL, decrease in CLL/SLL in men, and decrease in MM in women.","['Mitterlechner, T', 'Fiegl, M', 'Muhlbock, H', 'Oberaigner, W', 'Dirnhofer, S', 'Tzankov, A']","['Mitterlechner T', 'Fiegl M', 'Muhlbock H', 'Oberaigner W', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A']","['The Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Muellerstrasse 44, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Austria/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Distribution']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['59/1/48 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2005.026815 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2006 Jan;59(1):48-55. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2005.026815.,,,,,PMC1860250,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical studies suggest that it is necessary to infuse as many Tregs as conventional donor T cells to achieve a clinical effect on GVHD. Thus, it would be necessary to expand Tregs ex vivo before transplantation. Two strategies have been proposed: expansion of Tregs stimulated by anti-CD3/CD28-coated microbeads for polyclonal activation or by host-type allogeneic APCs for selecting Tregs specific for host Ags. In this study, we describe the mechanisms by which ex vivo-expanded Tregs act on donor T cells to prevent GVHD in mice. We demonstrate that expanded Tregs strongly inhibited the division, expansion, and differentiation of donor T cells, with a more pronounced effect with Tregs specific for host Ags.

In this study, we suggest a role for oxidative stress on TGF-beta signaling, leading to prevention of its normal anti-inflammatory effects but leaving its Smad-driven effects on cellular differentiation or matrix production unaffected. Stimulation of the RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, human or mouse alveolar macrophages with LPS led to NF-kappaB-driven production of proinflammatory mediators, which were inhibited by TGF-beta. This inhibition was prevented in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. We found that hydrogen peroxide acted by inducing p38 MAPK activation, which then prevented the ERK activation and MAPK phosphatase-1 up-regulation normally induced by TGF-beta. This was mediated through Src tyrosine kinases and protein phosphatase-1/2A. By contrast, hydrogen peroxide had no effects on TGF-beta-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and SBE-luc reporter gene transcription.","['Xiao, Yi Qun', 'Freire-de-Lima, Celio G', 'Janssen, William J', 'Morimoto, Konosuke', 'Lyu, Dennis', 'Bratton, Donna L', 'Henson, Peter M']","['Xiao YQ', 'Freire-de-Lima CG', 'Janssen WJ', 'Morimoto K', 'Lyu D', 'Bratton DL', 'Henson PM']","['Program in Cell Biology, Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO 80206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/biosynthesis', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smad2 Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/2/1209 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.2.1209 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jan 15;176(2):1209-17. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.2.1209.,"['AI058228/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL34303/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL67671/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dusp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein is unusual among family members in that it has a very short half-life of 2-3 h. In this report, we show that sodium salicylate (at 10 mM) greatly enhances the rate at which neutrophils undergo apoptosis and, in parallel, greatly accelerates the turnover rate of Mcl-1, decreasing its half-life to only 90 min. Whereas constitutive and GM-CSF-modified Mcl-1 turnover is regulated by the proteasome, the accelerated sodium salicylate-induced Mcl-1 turnover is mediated largely via caspases. Sodium salicylate resulted in rapid activation of caspase-3, -8, -9, and -10, and salicylate-accelerated Mcl-1 turnover was partly blocked by caspase inhibitors. Sodium salicylate also induced dramatic changes in the activities of members of the MAPK family implicated in Mcl-1 turnover and apoptosis. For example, sodium salicylate blocked GM-CSF-stimulated Erk and Akt activation, but resulted in rapid and sustained activation of p38-MAPK, an event mimicked by okadaic acid that also accelerates Mcl-1 turnover and neutrophil apoptosis. These data thus shed important new insights into the dynamic and highly regulated control of neutrophil apoptosis that is effected by modification in the rate of Mcl-1 turnover.","['Derouet, Mathieu', 'Thomas, Luke', 'Moulding, Dale A', 'Akgul, Cahit', 'Cross, Andrew', 'Moots, Robert J', 'Edwards, Steven W']","['Derouet M', 'Thomas L', 'Moulding DA', 'Akgul C', 'Cross A', 'Moots RJ', 'Edwards SW']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sodium Salicylate/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/2/957 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.2.957 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jan 15;176(2):957-65. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.2.957.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, we have provided evidence that Bcr/Abl overexpression in leukemic cells increased their susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis by different mechanisms. In the present study, using UT-7/9 cells, a high level Bcr/Abl transfectant of UT-7 cells, we show that the treatment of Bcr/Abl target by imatinib mesylate (IM), a specific Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, hampers the formation of the NK/target immunological synapse. The main effect of IM involves an induction of surface GM1 ganglioside on Bcr/Abl transfectants that prevents the redistribution of MHC-related Ag molecules in lipid rafts upon interaction with NK cells. IM also affects cell surface glycosylation of targets, as assessed by binding of specific lectins resulting in the subsequent modulation of their binding to lectin type NK receptor, particularly NKG2D. In addition, we demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase activity repression results in a decrease of MHC-related Ags-A/B and UL-16-binding protein expression on Bcr/Abl transfectants UT-7/9. We show that NKG2D controls the NK-mediated lysis of UT-7/9 cells, and IM treatment inhibits this activating pathway. Taken together, our results show that the high expression of Bcr/Abl in leukemic cells controls the expression of NKG2D receptor ligands and membrane GM1 via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism and that the modulation of these molecules by IM interferes with NK cell recognition and cytolysis of the transfectants.","['Cebo, Christelle', 'Da Rocha, Sylvie', 'Wittnebel, Sebastian', 'Turhan, Ali G', 'Abdelali, Jalil', 'Caillat-Zucman, Sophie', 'Bourhis, Jean Henri', 'Chouaib, Salem', 'Caignard, Anne']","['Cebo C', 'Da Rocha S', 'Wittnebel S', 'Turhan AG', 'Abdelali J', 'Caillat-Zucman S', 'Bourhis JH', 'Chouaib S', 'Caignard A']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 487, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/*metabolism', 'Genes, abl', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Transfection']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/2/864 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.2.864 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jan 15;176(2):864-72. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.2.864.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (MICB antigen)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These derivatives include mafosfamide (NSC 345842), glufosfamide (D19575, beta-D-glucosylisophosphoramide mustard), NSC 612567 (aldophosphamide perhydrothiazine), and NSC 613060 (aldophosphamide thiazolidine). This review highlights the metabolism and transport of these oxazaphosphorines (mainly CPA and IFO, as these two oxazaphosphorine drugs are the most widely used alkylating agents) and the clinical implications. Both CPA and IFO are prodrugs that require activation by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)-catalyzed 4-hydroxylation, yielding cytotoxic nitrogen mustards capable of reacting with DNA molecules to form crosslinks and lead to cell apoptosis and/or necrosis. Such prodrug activation can be enhanced within tumor cells by the CYP-based gene directed-enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) approach. However, those newly synthesized oxazaphosphorine derivatives such as glufosfamide, NSC 612567 and NSC 613060, do not need hepatic activation. They are activated through other enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic pathways. For example, both NSC 612567 and NSC 613060 can be activated by plain phosphodiesterase (PDEs) in plasma and other tissues or by the high-affinity nuclear 3'-5' exonucleases associated with DNA polymerases, such as DNA polymerases and epsilon. The alternative CYP-catalyzed inactivation pathway by N-dechloroethylation generates the neurotoxic and nephrotoxic byproduct chloroacetaldehyde (CAA). Various aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of oxazaphosphorine metabolites. The metabolism of oxazaphosphorines is auto-inducible, with the activation of the orphan nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) being the major mechanism. Oxazaphosphorine metabolism is affected by a number of factors associated with the drugs (e.g., dosage, route of administration, chirality, and drug combination) and patients (e.g., age, gender, renal and hepatic function). Several drug transporters, such as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP1, MRP2, and MRP4) are involved in the active uptake and efflux of parental oxazaphosphorines, their cytotoxic mustards and conjugates in hepatocytes and tumor cells. Oxazaphosphorine metabolism and transport have a major impact on pharmacokinetic variability, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship, toxicity, resistance, and drug interactions since the drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters involved are key determinants of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxazaphosphorines. A better understanding of the factors that affect the metabolism and transport of oxazaphosphorines is important for their optional use in cancer chemotherapy.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Tian, Quan', 'Yung Chan, Sui', 'Chuen Li, Shu', 'Zhou, Shufeng', 'Duan, Wei', 'Zhu, Yi-Zhun']","['Zhang J', 'Tian Q', 'Yung Chan S', 'Chuen Li S', 'Zhou S', 'Duan W', 'Zhu YZ']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Drug Metab Rev,Drug metabolism reviews,0322067,IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Transport', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*Phosphoramide Mustards/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",639,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/02/14 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['K78758H141354477 [pii]', '10.1080/03602530500364023 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Rev. 2005;37(4):611-703. doi: 10.1080/03602530500364023.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are responsible for phosphorylating these receptors, which create docking sites for downstream molecules such as the signal transducer and activator of transcription family members. In addition, cytokine receptors associate with members of the Src family kinase (SFK). JAKs and SFK work in concert to activate many of the signalling molecules, with both kinase families required for optimal transmission of intracellular signals. JAKs and SFK are also required for the activation and recruitment of negative regulators of cytokine signalling, e.g., protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and suppressors of cytokine signalling. Aberrant activity of the JAK-Src kinase duet can result in hemopoietic abnormalities including leukaemia. Additionally, the recent identification of a somatic JAK2 mutation as the cause of polycythema vera, further highlights the clinical importance of these molecules.","['Ingley, Evan', 'Klinken, S Peter']","['Ingley E', 'Klinken SP']","['Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and UWA Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Perth, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/*physiology']",72,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['L026W58GL77TW266 [pii]', '10.1080/08977190500368031 [doi]']",ppublish,Growth Factors. 2006 Mar;24(1):89-95. doi: 10.1080/08977190500368031.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program for the most recent five-year period, 1998-2002, reveal that 56% of all newly diagnosed cancer patients and 71% of cancer deaths are in this age group. Median ages of cancer patients at death for the major tumors common to both males and females, all races (lung, colorectal, lymphoma, leukemia, pancreas, stomach, urinary bladder) range from 71 to 77 years. The median age for prostate cancer is 79 years; for ovarian and female breast cancer, the median age is 71 for each tumor. These cancer statistics when cast against the demographic changes occurring in the U.S. population take on urgency and importance for cancer treatment and care in our nation's health care system. The U.S. Census Bureau demographic projections indicate that the number of persons 65 years and older in the United States will double from the current estimate of 35 million persons to a projected 70 million by 2030. Barring any cancer prevention breakthroughs, the expansion of the aged population will likely increase the absolute number of older individuals diagnosed and treated for cancer in coming decades. The United States is not unique as an aging developed industrial nation with a high proportion of the cancer burden in the elderly. Other developed industrial countries have a potentiality for increased cancer incidence and mortality as their populations grow older. This paper, using U.S. Bureau of Census demographic projections and current age standardized death rates per 100,000 population (from Worldwide Cancer Mortality Statistics, Cancer Mondial, WHO, and the International Association for Research on Cancer) compares cancer in the elderly in Italy and the United States. Italy is demographically ranked as the oldest nation in the world. Dimensions of the cancer burden challenge ahead are inferred in the context of two countries with aging populations to underscore the possible increase that demographic factors may have on the magnitude of the cancer problem for older persons in the next 25 years.","['Yancik, Rosemary']",['Yancik R'],"['National Institute on Aging, NIH, NDHHS, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-9205, USA. yancikr@nia.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer J,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Life Expectancy/trends', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality/prevention & control', '*Population Dynamics', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/03/31 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00130404-200511000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer J. 2005 Nov-Dec;11(6):437-41. doi: 10.1097/00130404-200511000-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time, an increase in human exposure to heptachlor in children was detected, but no evidence of serious health effects was observed. In an ecologic study design, this report compares mortality and cancer incidence rates of children and adolescents born from 1980 to 1982 to rates of children born before and after the heptachlor episode. Children born from 1980 to 1982 on Oahu were considered to be the exposed population, whereas children born during the same time on the other Hawaiian islands and all children born before 1980 and after 1982 constituted the unexposed population. Poisson regression was used to compare rates by age group, year, birth cohort, and place of residence. Death rates among children born from 1980 to 1982 were consistent with the overall declining mortality trend in children; the rates were consistently lower on Oahu than on the other islands. In agreement with the national trend, cancer incidence rates increased slightly in Hawaii during the last 25 years. Across all ages, cancer risk did not differ significantly between children born between 1980 and 1982 and those born during earlier and later years. However, a slightly higher occurrence of cancer for the heptachlor-exposed cohort when they were 15-19 years old deserves continued observation in the future.

However, without some form of standardized methodology between laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult. METHODS: Using TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were different. RESULTS: The detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p < 0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.","['Fossey, Sallyanne C', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez, Andrea', 'Garrett, Carleton T', 'Dumur, Catherine I', 'Vnencak-Jones, Cindy L']","['Fossey SC', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez A', 'Garrett CT', 'Dumur CI', 'Vnencak-Jones CL']","['Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2006/01/06 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/06 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['944 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03260090 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 2005;9(4):187-93. doi: 10.1007/BF03260090.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its approved indication in the US is to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.A single subcutaneous injection of pegfilgrastim once per chemotherapy cycle was more effective than placebo as an adjunct to moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy for breast cancer, no less effective than daily injections of filgrastim as an adjunct to highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy for breast cancer, and as effective as daily filgrastim as an adjunct to chemotherapy for lymphoma (predominantly non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL]) and acute myeloid leukemia. Pegfilgrastim has also successfully supported delivery of dose-dense chemotherapy, stem cell mobilization, and stem cell transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid or myeloid malignancies. By offering a convenient alternative to daily filgrastim, once-per-cycle administration of pegfilgrastim has the potential to simplify the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, further improve patient health-related quality of life, and reduce total treatment costs in breast cancer and NHL, and possibly other cancer settings.

Now, in this second part, we are describing some factors of the child himself, as well as other proposed factors, but which have been evaluated in epidemiological research with less frequency. The most important host factor is Down's syndrome. Susceptibility aspects, such as HLA alleles, and aspects related to expositions around the home, late infections and the time in which the expositions occur, require more research.

Using immunohistochemistry, we have analyzed the protein expression of activated (p)CrkL in normal and malignant tissues. We then treated K562 leukemia cells with imatinib to analyze the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibition on CrkL activation. pCrkL expression was predominantly epithelial and detected in the majority of non-malignant prostate (79%), 49% of colon biopsies, 36% of skin biopsies, and 41% of samples obtained from normal brain. Protein expression was, however, considerably less frequent in normal breast (18%), lung (16%) and ovarian (12%) tissues. In contrast to their corresponding benign tissues, pCrkL expression was significantly more common in breast cancer samples (49%, p<0.0001; Fisher's exact test), lung carcinomas (55%, p=0.0002), lymphatic tissues (80% vs. 10%, p=0.012), skin cancer (67%, p=0.020), ovarian malignomas (50%, p<0.0001) and colon carcinomas (63%, p<0.03). By contrast, activated CrkL was significantly less frequent in prostate carcinoma samples when compared to corresponding non-malignant prostatic tissues (14% vs. 79%, p<0.0001). pCrkL expression was abrogated in K562 cells with the addition of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which indicates that phosphorylation of CrkL is mediated through targets of therapeutic TK inhibition. We hypothesize that pCrkL is selectively up-regulated in a number of malignant tumor entities and involved in malignant transformation. We further suggest that pCrkL might serve as a potential surrogate parameter for the efficacy of therapeutic TK inhibition.","['Singer, Christian F', 'Hudelist, Gernot', 'Lamm, Wolfgang', 'Mueller, Ruth', 'Handl, Claudia', 'Kubista, Ernst', 'Czerwenka, Klaus']","['Singer CF', 'Hudelist G', 'Lamm W', 'Mueller R', 'Handl C', 'Kubista E', 'Czerwenka K']","['Division of Senology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. christian.singer@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*biosynthesis', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Up-Regulation']",,2006/01/05 09:00,2006/06/02 09:00,['2006/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2006 Feb;15(2):353-9.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At diagnosis, patients who relapsed early after diagnosis could not be distinguished from refractory patients based on DEFA1-3 expression levels. Results suggest that high levels of DEFA1-3 mRNA and alpha-defensin1-3 protein expression are correlated with disease progression and failure of adequate response to conventional chemotherapy.","['Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Bicciato, Silvio', 'Franceschini, Lisa', 'Accordi, Benedetta', 'Delliorto, Marta Campo', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Te Kronnie G', 'Bicciato S', 'Franceschini L', 'Accordi B', 'Delliorto MC', 'Rinaldi A', 'Pession A', 'Barisone E', 'Conter V', 'Locatelli F', 'Basso G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, via Giustiniani 3, I-35128 Padova, Italy. truustekronnie@unipd.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DEFICIENS Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",,2006/01/05 09:00,2006/06/02 09:00,['2006/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2006 Feb;15(2):341-6.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DEFICIENS Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, we have shown that the second generation of the effective microorganism fermentation extract (EM-X2) possessed growth inhibition on human cancer cells involving MDA-MB231 breast cancer and K-562 chronic myelogenous leukaemia cells. Elevation of super oxide dismutase activity from EM-X2 treated cancer cell extract was observed. However, the possible anti-cancer activity of the first generation of the EM-X was not reported. Here we demonstrate that the concentrated form of the EM-X from its original fluid also possess antiproliferation ability together with induction of apoptosis on the human cancer cell lines including Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and KG1a acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Similar effect could also be demonstrated on primary cultured bone marrow samples isolated from patients with AML. Morphological inspection revealed that common apoptotic feature was found on these concentrated EM-X treated cancer cells. Both the anchorage-dependent clonogenicity assay on Hep3B HCC and methyl-cellulose colony formation assay on KG1a cells and bone marrow cells from AML patients further revealed the ability of the concentrated EM-X on reducing their colony formation ability. Incubating KG1a with concentrated EM-X readily induced apoptosis as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis. Interestingly, few growth inhibition effect of the concentrated EM-X was observed on both the SV40 transformed THLE-2 liver epithelial cells and primary cultured non-malignant haematological disordered bone marrow. Collectively, this concentrated EM-X is effective in inducing cell death and reducing the regeneration potential of both Hep3B HCC and KG1a AML cells in vitro.","['Chui, Chung Hin', 'Hau, Desmond Kwok Po', 'Lau, Fung Yi', 'Cheng, Gregory Yin Ming', 'Wong, Raymond Siu Ming', 'Gambari, Roberto', 'Kok, Stanton Hon Lung', 'Lai, Ka Bik', 'Teo, Ivy Tuang Ngo', 'Leung, Thomas Wai Tong', 'Higa, Teruo', 'Ke, Bin', 'Tang, Johnny Cheuk On', 'Fong, David Wan Fun', 'Chan, Albert Sun Chi']","['Chui CH', 'Hau DK', 'Lau FY', 'Cheng GY', 'Wong RS', 'Gambari R', 'Kok SH', 'Lai KB', 'Teo IT', 'Leung TW', 'Higa T', 'Ke B', 'Tang JC', 'Fong DW', 'Chan AS']","['State Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, P.R.

In this study, the effect of cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction and the concomitant use of an anticancer agent by VK2 (menaquinone: MK4), on gastric cancer cell lines were examined. When 4 kinds of gastric cancer cells (KATO III, MKN7, MKN74 and FU97) were exposed to MK4, the cell growth was inhibited in an MK4 dose-dependent manner. Morphologically, apoptosis induced by MK4 was recognized in FU97, but only a slight number of apoptotic images was recognized in other cell lines. On the contrary, in all the cell lines, the percentage of APO2.7 positive cells increased significantly in the MK4-treated group as compared to the controls. Caspase-3 activity increased significantly in KATO III and FU97 as compared to the controls, while no significant differences were noted in MKN7 or MKN74. Moreover, in all the cell lines, the percentage of G0/G1-phase cells ( approximately 70% in KATO III and FU97, and > or =80% in MKN7 and MKN74) increased in comparison to the controls, suggesting that cell-cycle arrest had occurred. All of the gastric cancer cell lines were given MK4 in different concentrations and two kinds of anticancer agent, with the result that cell growth was inhibited by the anticancer agent in a dose-dependent manner when it was given with MK4 in concentrations of up to 10 microM. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the effect of MK4 on apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest differs in differentiated (MKN7, MKN74) and undifferentiated (KATO III, FU97) gastric cancer cell lines, and that MK4 alone or with anticancer agents has an antitumor effect on gastric cancer cell lines.","['Tokita, Hiromi', 'Tsuchida, Akihiko', 'Miyazawa, Keisuke', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Katayanagi, Soh', 'Sudo, Hideo', 'Enomoto, Masanobu', 'Takagi, Yu', 'Aoki, Tatsuya']","['Tokita H', 'Tsuchida A', 'Miyazawa K', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Katayanagi S', 'Sudo H', 'Enomoto M', 'Takagi Y', 'Aoki T']","['Third Department of Surgery and First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Docetaxel', 'Humans', 'Stomach Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Taxoids/pharmacology', 'Vitamin K 2/*pharmacology']",,2006/01/05 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2006/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2006 Feb;17(2):235-43.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Taxoids)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIR2 and its mammalian derivatives play a central role in epigenetic gene silencing, recombination, metabolism, cell differentiation and in the regulation of aging. In contrast to most sirtuins, SIRT6 lacks NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase activity. We have isolated and characterized the human Sirt6 genomic sequence, which spans a region of 8,427 bp and which has one single genomic locus. Determination of the exon-intron splice junctions found the full-length SIRT6 protein to consist of 8 exons ranging in size from 60 bp (exon 4) to 838 bp (exon 8). The human Sirt6 open reading frame encodes a 355-aa protein with a predictive molecular weight of 39.1 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.12. Characterization of the 5' flanking genomic region, which precedes the Sirt6 open reading frame, revealed a TATA- and CCAAT-box less promoter with an approximately 300-bp long CpG island. A number of AML-1 and GATA-x transcription factor binding sites were found which remain to be further evaluated experimentally. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis localized the human Sirt6 gene to chromosome 19p13.3; a region which is frequently affected by chromosomal alterations in acute leukemia. Human SIRT6 appears to be most predominantly expressed in bone cells and in the ovaries while, in the bone marrow, it is practically absent.

The antigenic peptide is entirely encoded within a unique exon not present in other PANE1 transcripts. Sequencing of PANE1 alleles in mHAg-positive and mHAg-negative cells demonstrates that differential T-cell recognition is due to a single nucleotide polymorphism within the variant exon that replaces an arginine codon with a translation termination codon. The PANE1 transcript that encodes the mHAg is expressed at high levels in resting CD19(+) B cells and B-lineage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, and at significantly lower levels in activated B cells. Activation of B-CLL cells through CD40 ligand (CD40L) stimulation decreases expression of the mHAg-encoding PANE1 transcript and reciprocally increases expression of PANE1 transcripts lacking the mHAg-encoding exon.

Here we demonstrate that surface IL-21 receptor (R) is expressed at variable levels by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells freshly isolated from 33 different patients. IL-21R expression was up-regulated following cell stimulation via surface CD40. Therefore, IL-21 effects were more evident in CD40-activated CLL B cells. IL-21 induced an early signaling cascade in CLL B cells, which included JAK-1 and JAK-3 autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5. IL-21 signaling failed to stimulate CLL B-cell proliferation, but induced their apoptosis. In addition, IL-21 counteracted the proliferative and antiapoptotic signals delivered by IL-15 to CLL B cells. IL-21-mediated apoptosis involved activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, cleavage of Bid to its active form t-Bid, and cleavage of PARP and of p27Kip-1.

It is regarded as a novel and targeted approach to leukemia treatment, based on our better understanding of the hematopoietic process and the mechanisms of its deregulation during leukemogenesis. Clinically, differentiation therapy has been most successful in acute promyelocytic leukemia using all-trans-retinoic acid as the inducer, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. This review presents evidence that a number of hematopoietic cytokines play important roles in both normal and aberrant hematopoietic processes. In vitro laboratory investigations in the past two decades using well-characterized myeloid leukemic cell lines and primary blast cells from leukemia patients have revealed that many hematopoietic cytokines can trigger lineage-specific differentiation of leukemia cells, which may have important implications in the clinical setting. Moreover, our current understanding of cytokine interactions and the molecular mechanisms of cytokine-induced leukemic cell differentiation will be discussed in the light of recent findings. Finally, ways in which laboratory research on cytokines in the differentiation therapy of leukemia can lead to the improved design of protocols for future clinical applications to leukemia therapy will also be addressed.","['Leung, K N', 'Mak, N K', 'Fung, M C']","['Leung KN', 'Mak NK', 'Fung MC']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China. knleung@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology']",223,2006/01/05 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['M7183T2150211363 [pii]', '10.1080/10408360500295154 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2005;42(5-6):473-514. doi: 10.1080/10408360500295154.,,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1-ETO inhibits normal definitive hematopoiesis and blocks erythroid differentiation. Several mechanistic models for the role of AML1-ETO in leukemia development have emerged over the last decade. Most of these models have emphasized the capacity of the fusion protein to redirect repressive cofactors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), to RUNX target genes, thereby reversing the hematopoietic transcriptional program activated by wild-type RUNX1a phenomenon referred to collectively in this review as the ""classical"" corepressor model.

However, little is known about the involvement of cytoskeletal proteins in this process. The heterodimeric transcription factor PEBP2/CBF is composed of a DNA-binding subunit, Runx1, and a non-DNA-binding subunit, PEBP2beta/CBFbeta. The Runx1 protein possesses nuclear localization signals and is found exclusively in the nucleus, whereas PEBP2beta is located in the cytoplasm in most cells and tissues examined thus far. We investigated the mechanism by which PEBP2beta localizes to the cytoplasm and found that it associates with filamin A, an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein. Filamin A retains PEBP2beta in the cytoplasm, thereby hindering its engagement as a Runx1 partner. When filamin A is absent, PEBP2beta moves into the nucleus and enhances Runx1-dependent transcription. These observations highlight the significance of the subcellular localization of PEBP2beta in regulating its activity as a component of the PEBP2/CBF transcription factor. In humans, PEBP2beta is frequently targeted in the leukemia-associated chromosomal abnormality, inversion 16 (inv 16). Thus, identifying the factors that mediate the subcellular localization of the PEBP2beta-derived chimeric transcription factor produced by inv 16 is an important issue that will need to be resolved in order to understand the mechanism(s) involved in inv 16-induced leukemogenesis.","['Watanabe, Toshio', 'Yoshida, Naomi', 'Satake, Masanobu']","['Watanabe T', 'Yoshida N', 'Satake M']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. watanabe@idac.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,9007261,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Contractile Proteins/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Filamins', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport']",44,2006/01/05 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['6dedbb2b727bc9fa,3f8f27952cbc9b61 [pii]', '10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v15.i3.20 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 2005;15(3):197-206. doi: 10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v15.i3.20.,,"['0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Filamins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although point mutations of critical genes had been demonstrated to contribute to the development of MDS, there was no strong correlation between these mutations and clinical features. Recently, we reported the high incidence of somatic mutations in the AML1/RUNX1 gene (which is a critical regulator of definitive hematopoiesis and the most frequent target for translocation of acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in MDS, especially refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), and AML following MDS (defined here as MDS/AML). The MDS/AML patients with AML1 mutations had a significantly worse prognosis than those without AML1 mutations.

This study reports a contrasting situation in normal epithelial tissues and an association with skin pathogenesis, particularly in psoriasis. We investigated several cell lines, five of them were epithelial and six were hematopoietic, white blood cells from normal, healthy donors, and normal microdissected epithelium of kidney, liver, breast, cervix, lung, prostate, bladder, and skin. Interestingly, promoter 2 hypermethylation was apparent in all epithelial cell lines and tissues. However, distinctive degrees of demethylation were noted in some skin samples. The methylation patterns of each cell line corresponded to their mRNA isoforms, in that isoforms I and II could not be detected with either promoter 1 or 2 hypermethylation, respectively. We further explored whether an enhanced degree of demethylation could be observed in various dermatopathology lesions. While the promoter 2 methylation levels of squamous cell cancers, eczemas, and normal skins were not different, a significant degree of demethylation can be observed in psoriasis (p<0.005). In addition, psoriasis displays a higher level of SHP-1 isoform II than normal skin (p<0.05). In conclusion, this study discovered an unprecedented role of SHP-1 methylation in tissue-specific expression and its alteration in a nonmalignant human disease besides the transcription inhibition in leukemia and lymphoma.

However, the precise mechanism by which inhibition of BCR/ABL activity results in pharmacological responses remains unknown. BCR/ABL-positive human K562 CML cells resistant to doxorubicin (K562DoxR) and their sensitive counterparts (K562DoxS) were used to determine the mechanism by which the STI571 inhibitor may overcome drug resistance. K562 wild type cells and CCRF-CEM lymphoblastic leukemia cells without BCR/ABL were used as controls. The STI571 specificity was examined by use of murine pro-B lymphoid Baf3 cells with or without BCR/ABL kinase expression. We examined kinetics of DNA repair after cell treatment with doxorubicin in the presence or absence of STI571 by the alkaline comet assay. The MTT assay was used to estimate resistance against doxorubicin and Western blot analysis with Crk-L antibody was performed to evaluate BCR/ABL kinase inhibition by STI571. We provide evidence that treatment of CML-derived BCR/ABL-expressing leukemia K562 cells with STI571 results in the inhibition of DNA repair and abrogation of the resistance of these cells to doxorubicin. We found that doxorubicin-resistant K562DoxR cells exhibited accelerated kinetics of DNA repair compared with doxorubicin-sensitive K562DoxS cells. Inhibition of BCR/ABL kinase in K562DoxR cells with 1 microM STI571 decreased the kinetics of DNA repair and abrogated drug resistance. The results suggest that STI571-mediated inhibition of BCR/ABL kinase activity can affect the effectiveness of the DNA-repair pathways, which in turn may enhance drug sensitivity of leukemia cells.","['Majsterek, Ireneusz', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Poplawski, Tomasz', 'Pytel, Dariusz', 'Kowalski, Michal', 'Slupianek, Artur', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Majsterek I', 'Sliwinski T', 'Poplawski T', 'Pytel D', 'Kowalski M', 'Slupianek A', 'Skorski T', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16 street, 90-237 Lodz, Poland. imajst@biol.uni.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/01/04 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2006/01/04 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(05)00286-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2005.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 Jan 31;603(1):74-82. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2005.10.010.

There are four mRNAs, PPAR-gamma1, PPAR-gamma2, PPAR-gamma3 and PPAR-gamma4, which encode two proteins, PPAR-gamma1and PPAR-gamma2. PPAR-gamma consists of five or six structural regions (A-F) in four functional domains. The NH2-terminal A/B domain harbors a ligand-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1), the C domain is a DNA binding domain (DBD), the D hinge region is important for co-factor docking and the complex multifunctional COOH-terminal portion (E/F) encompasses the ligand binding domain (LBD), a dimerization interface and the ligand-dependent activation domain AF-2. Some long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic acid metabolites and fatty acid derived components are natural ligands of PPAR-gamma. The anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione class of drugs, certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some non-thiazolidinedione tyrosine are the synthetic ligands of PPAR-gamma. After activation, it forms heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and then binds to specific recognition sites in the target gene, the peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs), and regulates transcription of specific genes. PPAR-gamma has potential anti-neoplastic effects both in solid cancer and in leukemia through inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and terminal differentiation, as well as inhibition of angiogenesis. The ligands of PPAR-gamma may represent a promising, novel therapeutic approach for certain human malignancies.","['Wang, Tingting', 'Xu, Jian', 'Yu, Xiaofei', 'Yang, Renchi', 'Han, Zhong Chao']","['Wang T', 'Xu J', 'Yu X', 'Yang R', 'Han ZC']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', '*PPAR gamma/genetics/metabolism']",146,2006/01/04 09:00,2006/06/24 09:00,['2006/01/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(05)00175-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2005.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2006 Apr;58(1):1-14. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2005.08.011.

Involvement of caspase cascades and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation.,149-58,"UNLABELLED: The aim of this work was to investigate whether in vivo and in vitro pentoxifylline (PTX) sensitizes hematological tumor cells to adriamycin (ADM)-induced apoptosis, and to investigate the involvement of caspase cascades and phosphorylated forms of IkappaBalpha. Balb/c mice inoculated intraperitoneally with L5178-Y murine lymphoma cells were used for in vivo experiments and for survival studies. The U937 human monocytic cell line was used for in vitro experiments. Both cell lines were treated under similar experimental conditions with PTX and/or ADM to assess their effects on apoptosis. Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy with ethidium bromide and acridine orange staining and confirmed by electrophoretic DNA analysis. Caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk, Z-DEVD-fmk, and Z-LEHD-fmk were used to investigate the involvement of caspase cascades. C-terminally and Ser32 phosphorylated forms of IkappaBalpha were evaluated in cytoplasmic extracts in the absence or presence of TNFalpha. RESULTS: In vivo, PTX (50 mg/kg) with ADM (5 mg/kg) increased the apoptotic index relative to PTX or ADM administered alone, time- and dose-dependently. DNA laddering appeared in lymphoma cells treated with PTX+ADM at 24 h, whereas neither untreated control, PTX-, nor ADM-treated cells showed DNA fragmentation. All (100%) tumor-bearing mice treated with PTX (25 mg/kg)+ADM (2.5 mg/kg) survived for 1 year, whereas the mortality rates of mice treated with either PTX or ADM alone at the same doses were similar to that of untreated tumor-bearing mice (28+/-3 days). Caspase inhibitors inhibited apoptosis more efficiently in PTX- or ADM-treated cultures than in PTX+ADM-treated cultures. Pretreatment with TNFalpha (10 ng/mL) increased apoptosis in PTX- or ADM-treated U937 cells. However, the apoptotic index of PTX+ADM-treated cultures was significantly reduced and the expression of C-terminally and Ser32 phosphorylated IkappaBalpha was reduced. PTX sensitizes hematological malignancies to ADR-induced apoptosis. An independent caspase pathway is involved in PTX+ADM-induced apoptosis. The phosphorylation status of IkappaBalpha is closely related via TNFalpha to the possible mechanisms of drug resistance.","['Lerma-Diaz, Jose Manuel', 'Hernandez-Flores, Georgina', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez, Jorge R', 'Ortiz-Lazareno, Pablo C', 'Gomez-Contreras, Piedad', 'Cervantes-Munguia, Ramon', 'Scott-Algara, Daniel', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F', 'Bravo-Cuellar, Alejandro']","['Lerma-Diaz JM', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez JR', 'Ortiz-Lazareno PC', 'Gomez-Contreras P', 'Cervantes-Munguia R', 'Scott-Algara D', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A', 'Jave-Suarez LF', 'Bravo-Cuellar A']","['Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente, IMSS, Division de Inmunologia, Sierra Mojada 800, Col.

Previously, structural analyses of fully functional G alpha(12/13) subunits have been hindered by insufficient amounts of homogeneous, functional protein. Herein, we report that substitution of the N-terminal helix of G alpha(i1) for the corresponding region of G alpha12 or G alpha13 generated soluble chimeric subunits (G alpha(i/12) and G alpha(i/13)) that could be purified in sufficient amounts for crystallographic studies. Each chimera bound guanine nucleotides, G betagamma subunits, and effector proteins and exhibited GAP responses to p115RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF. Like their wild-type counterparts, G alpha(i/13), but not G alpha(i/12), stimulated the activity of p115RhoGEF. Crystal structures of the G alpha(i/12) x GDP x AlF4(-) and G alpha(i/13) x GDP complexes were determined using diffraction data extending to 2.9 and 2.0 A, respectively. These structures reveal not only the native structural features of G alpha12 and G alpha13 subunits, which are expected to be important for their interactions with GPCRs and effectors such as G alpha-regulated RhoGEFs, but also novel conformational changes that are likely coupled to GTP hydrolysis in the G alpha(12/13) class of heterotrimeric G proteins.","['Kreutz, Barry', 'Yau, Douglas M', 'Nance, Mark R', 'Tanabe, Shihori', 'Tesmer, John J G', 'Kozasa, Tohru']","['Kreutz B', 'Yau DM', 'Nance MR', 'Tanabe S', 'Tesmer JJ', 'Kozasa T']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera/genetics/metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotides/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors']",,2006/01/04 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/01/04 09:00'],"['2006/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi051729t [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2006 Jan 10;45(1):167-74. doi: 10.1021/bi051729t.,"['GM61454/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM061454/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS41441/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL071818/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL071818-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM061454-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL071818/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS041441-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS041441/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (G-protein Beta gamma)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)']",,,PMC2688741,['NIHMS60855'],,,,,,,,,,,

The recognition of the prognostic role of IgVH hypermutation status and related phenotypic changes (CD38, ZAP-70 expression) as well as of chromosome abnormalities defined by cytogenetic analysis enabled a refined classification of the disease. Improvements in karyotyping and the introduction of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in routine hematological diagnostics raised the detection rate of chromosomal aberrations to approx. 60-80% in CLL. Among them, deletions of 17p and 11q have been associated with unfavorable prognosis. The deletion of the p53 locus (17p13) was described as the strongest independent predictor for aggressive behavior, resistance to chemotherapy and early death.

The present study was designed to estimated the effects of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated protein X (Bax), and osteopontin (OPN) on the apoptosis of renal tubular cells induced by NaF at different levels. The technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and densitometer scanning volume density were used to evaluate the changes of Bcl-2, Bax, and OPN mRNA in tubular cells treated with different doses of NaF (0, 1, 5, 7.5, 12.5 mgF-/L) for 48 h. Compared to control, the level of Bax mRNA significantly increased at cells of the 7.5- and 12.5-mg F-/L groups and the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA obviously decreased at cells of the 5- and 7.5-mg F-/L groups. The NaF also enhanced the expression of OPN mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, but the strongest expression of OPN mRNA was observed at cells of the 7.5-mg F-/L group. The results suggested that NaF induces the apoptosis in renal tubules via activation of the Bax expression and Bcl-2 suppression; OPN probably acts as protective role against apoptosis in fluoride-treated renal cells.","['Xu, Hui', 'Jin, Xiang-Qun', 'Jing, Ling', 'Li, Guang-Sheng']","['Xu H', 'Jin XQ', 'Jing L', 'Li GS']","['Institute of Endemic Diseases, Jilin University, 828 Xinmin, ChangChun 130021, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Kidney Tubules/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Osteopontin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sodium Fluoride/*toxicity', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,2006/01/03 09:00,2006/03/30 09:00,['2006/01/03 09:00'],"['2005/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['BTER:109:1:055 [pii]', '10.1385/BTER:109:1:055 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2006 Jan;109(1):55-60. doi: 10.1385/BTER:109:1:055.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spp1 protein, rat)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groups of ewes (n = 11-19) were fed either 100% (high; H) or 50% (low; L) of metabolisable energy requirements for live-weight maintenance during selected windows of gestation. All animals were killed at days 50, 65 or 110 of gestation. Between mating and slaughter, control animals were fed the H ration, while animals of other subgroups were fed the L ration from (a) mating to slaughter at 50, 65 or 110 days; (b) 0 to 30 days; (c) 31 to 50 or 65 days; or (d), in the day 110 slaughter group only, from 66 to 110 days. Bouin's-fixed fetal ovaries were examined for (a) Ki67 immunoexpression (proliferation) and (b) Bax and Mcl-1 (apoptosis-regulating genes) expression by in situ hybridisation (day 110) and immunohistochemistry (days 50, 65 and 110). At day 50, maternal nutrition had no effect on Ki67, predominant in germ cells, or Bax and Mcl-1, predominant in the oocytes. Restricted maternal food intake from 0 to 30 days significantly reduced staining for Ki67 in germ cells at day 65 (P < 0.05) but increased staining in granulosa cells at day 110 (P < 0.05). In animals fed the L ration for 110 days, primordial follicle Bax and Mcl-1 were significantly increased (Bax: P < 0.01; Mcl-1: P < 0.05). Granulosa cell Bax was also increased (P < 0.05). When the L ration was fed from 66 to 110 days, granulosa cell Bax (P < 0.05) and primordial follicle Mcl-1 (P < 0.01) were also significantly increased. In the fetal ovarian vasculature, animals underfed for 0-110 days had significantly elevated perivascular Mcl-1 (P < 0.001) and endothelial Bax expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, at day 110, endothelial Mcl-1 was increased by underfeeding from 0 to 30 days (P < 0.05). These data indicate that maternal undernutrition alters proliferation and the expression of apoptosis-regulating genes in the developing fetal ovary.

Mikbeta1 identifies CD122, the beta-subunit shared by the IL-2 and IL-15 receptors. At the doses administered in this study the antibody inhibited the actions of IL-15 on both natural killer and T cells and that of IL-2 when the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor was expressed. Mikbeta1 treatment was not associated with significant toxicity or with the development of an immune response to the infused monoclonal antibody. At these doses of Mikbeta1, >95% saturation of the IL-2/IL-15beta receptor (CD122) on the surfaces of the leukemic cells was achieved. Furthermore, in seven patients this led to the down-modulation of the receptor from the surfaces of the leukemic cells. Nevertheless, no patients manifested a reduction in peripheral leukemic cell count or an amelioration of their hematocytopenia. This latter observation may reflect the fact that the monoclonal T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia leukemic cells of the patients did not produce IL-2 or IL-15 or require their actions for cell survival. In light of the lack of toxicity and lack of immunogenicity of the antibody observed in the present study and the role for IL-15 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, clinical trials should be performed using the humanized version of Mikbeta1 in groups of patients with human T cell lymphotropic virus I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and refractory celiac disease.","['Morris, John C', 'Janik, John E', 'White, Jeffrey D', 'Fleisher, Thomas A', 'Brown, Margaret', 'Tsudo, Mitsuru', 'Goldman, Carolyn K', 'Bryant, Bonita', 'Petrus, Michael', 'Top, Lois', 'Lee, Cathryn C', 'Gao, Wendy', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Morris JC', 'Janik JE', 'White JD', 'Fleisher TA', 'Brown M', 'Tsudo M', 'Goldman CK', 'Bryant B', 'Petrus M', 'Top L', 'Lee CC', 'Gao W', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, and Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-15/*antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/01/03 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2006/01/03 09:00'],"['2006/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['0509575103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0509575103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jan 10;103(2):401-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0509575103.

The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of bone marrow or peripheral blood hematopoietic cell collection in patients who obtained remission after daunorubicine plus cytarabine induction with cladribine (DAC-7) or without addition of cladribine (DA-7) in preparation for autotransplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients aged 41 years (range, 17-58 years) were included in this study: 33 cases in the DAC-7 and 33 in the DA-7 arm. Hematopoietic cells were collected from the bone marrow (ABMT, n = 29) or from the peripheral blood (ABCT, n = 37) using cytopheresis after administration of AraC (2 x 2 g/m2) on days 1, 3, 5 and subsequent G-CSF (10 microg/kg) from day 7 as mobilization therapy. RESULTS: The numbers of harvested CD34+ cells were similar in the DAC-7 and DA-7 pretreated patients both after harvesting from peripheral blood (2.55 x 10(6)/kg vs 2.5 x 10(6)/kg) and from bone marrow (1.62 x 10(6)/kg vs 1.55 x 10(6)/kg), respectively. The proportion of patients with sufficient material for autologous bone marrow transplantation was higher in the DAC-7 compared with the DA-7 arm.

We included all 6360 breast cancer patients that were recorded at the Geneva Cancer Registry between 1970 and 1999. Patients were followed for AML occurrence until December 2000. We calculated standardized incidence ratios of AML and identified factors modifying the risk of AML by multivariate Cox analysis. Twelve (0.2%) patients developed AML. In general, patients treated for breast cancer had a 3.5-fold (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8-6.0) increased risk of developing AML compared with the general population. In particular, patients who were older than 70 years at breast cancer diagnosis and those treated with radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) had a significantly increased risk of developing AML. This population-based study confirms that radiotherapy increases the risk of AML. Due to the relatively low number of women treated with chemotherapy without radiotherapy and due to the infrequency of the disease, the question of whether chemotherapy alone increases this risk of AML cannot yet be answered.","['Renella, R', 'Verkooijen, H M', 'Fioretta, G', 'Vlastos, G', 'Kurtz, J', 'Sappino, A P', 'Schafer, P', 'Neyroud-Caspar, I', 'Bouchardy, C']","['Renella R', 'Verkooijen HM', 'Fioretta G', 'Vlastos G', 'Kurtz J', 'Sappino AP', 'Schafer P', 'Neyroud-Caspar I', 'Bouchardy C']","['Geneva Cancer Registry, Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Geneva, 55 Boulevard de la Cluse, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Breast,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9213011,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Population', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",,2006/01/03 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2006/01/03 09:00'],"['2005/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9776(05)00292-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.breast.2005.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Breast. 2006 Oct;15(5):614-9. doi: 10.1016/j.breast.2005.11.007.

Based on the results following from elemental analyses, infrared, NMR and ES+MS (electrospray mass spectra in the positive ion mode) spectroscopies, conductivity data, thermal analysis and X-ray structures, the tetrahedral Zn(II) complexes of the compositions [Zn(Olo)Cl(2)](n) (1), [Zn(iprOlo)Cl(2)](n) (2), [Zn(BohH(+))Cl(3)] x H(2)O (3) and [Zn(iprOloH(+))Cl(3)] x H(2)O (4) have been prepared, where Olo=2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-methylpurine (Olomoucine), iprOlo=2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine (i-propyl-Olomoucine), Boh=2-(3-hydroxypropylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine (Bohemine).

The 1D-polymeric chain of 1 consists of Zn(Olo)Cl(2) monomeric units in which the Zn(II) ion is coordinated by two chlorine atoms and one oxygen atom of the 2-hydroxyethylamino group of Olomoucine. The next monomeric unit is bonded to Zn(II) through the N7 atom of a purine ring. Thus, each of Zn(II) ions is tetrahedrally coordinated and a ZnCl(2)NO chromophore occurs in the complex 1. The complexes 3 and 4 are mononuclear species with a distorted tetrahedral arrangement of donor atoms around the Zn(II) ion with a ZnCl(3)N chromophore. The corresponding CDK inhibitor, i.e., both Boh and iprOlo, is coordinated to Zn(II) via the N7 atom of the purine ring in 3 and 4. The cytotoxicity of the zinc(II) complexes against human melanoma, sarcoma, leukaemia and carcinoma cell lines has been determined as well as the inhibition of the CDK2/cyclin E kinase. A relationship between the structure and biological activity of the complexes is also discussed.","['Travnicek, Zdenek', 'Krystof, Vladimir', 'Sipl, Michal']","['Travnicek Z', 'Krystof V', 'Sipl M']","['Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Palacky University, Krizkovskeho 10, CZ-771 47 Olomouc, Czech Republic. trav@aix.upol.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzyl Compounds', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Differential Thermal Analysis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetin/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Purines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Zinc Compounds/*chemistry/pharmacology']",,2006/01/03 09:00,2006/04/01 09:00,['2006/01/03 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0162-0134(05)00215-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2005.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 2006 Feb;100(2):214-25. doi: 10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2005.07.006.

Therefore, we have analyzed 83 children with acute B-lineage ALL (67 de novo patients and 19 relapses) by PCR analysis for clonal IgH, incomplete TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3) and TCRG rearrangements. It was shown that clonal cross-lineage TCR rearrangements were associated with more immature immunophenotype (CD34+, CD117+, CyIgM-) of leukemic cells from patients' bone marrow (BM) samples as compared to cell samples without cross-lineage TCR rearrangements. That was equally detected both in de novo and relapsed cases of disease. Low frequency of clonal TCRG rearrangements was associated with expression of E2A/PBX chimeric oncogene.

METHODS: We examined 30 newly diagnosed and proved cases of CML admitted in medical wards or attending a clinical hematology clinic. In addition to routine hematological investigations, lipid profile was done in all the patients at the time of presentation, 4-6 weeks after the start of chemotherapy and 6 months after the chemotherapy even if some of the patients were not in remission. RESULTS: Total serum cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations increased significantly after chemotherapy whereas serum triglyceride and VLDL-C cholesterol concentrations did not increase significantly. Also, lipid concentrations were correlated with disease activity. An inverse correlation was found with spleen size and total serum cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Serum triglyceride and VLDL-C concentrations were inversely related to the hemoglobin concentrations. There was no correlation of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations with hemoglobin. We found from the present study that low lipid concentrations are associated with poor prognosis of the disease. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the estimation of lipid profile may be helpful in evaluating the response to chemotherapy in CML patients.","['Ghalaut, Veena S', 'Pahwa, Manju B', 'Sunita', 'Ghalaut, P S']","['Ghalaut VS', 'Pahwa MB', 'Sunita', 'Ghalaut PS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pt.

We have evaluated the four most highly expressed genes from this profile, by quantitative real time RT-PCR, to determine whether any of these genes by itself could be useful as a diagnostic indicator. The levels of expression of N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase (GN6ST), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor M (PTPRmu), G protein-coupled receptor 49 (HG38) and KIAA1099 protein were determined in childhood precursor-B ALL samples from a cohort of 116 Indian patients.

Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the test procedure developed here can perform reasonable well with respect to Type I error even when the number of patients per stratum for each treatment is as small as two patients. We evaluate and study the power of the proposed test procedure in a variety of situations. We also include a comparison of the performance between the test statistics proposed elsewhere and the test procedure developed here. Finally, we briefly discuss the limitation of using the proposed test procedure. We use the data comparing two chemotherapy treatments in patients with multiple myeloma to illustrate the use of the proposed test procedure.","['Lui, Kung-Jong']",['Lui KJ'],"['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182-7720, USA. kjl@rohan.sdsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Biom J,Biometrical journal.

Defects in this mechanism are best reflected in microsatellite instability (MSI). We aimed to determine the role of MSI in a group of patients with dual malignancies and compared the data with that of patients with a single malignancy. Fifty patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 16 patients developed both solid and hematologic nonfamilial malignancies, 18 patients developed a single matched hematologic malignancy, and 16 a single matched solid malignancy. Five microsatellite markers were replicated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and analyzed by the GeneScan Analysis Software. The MSI-high phenotype was defined as instability in at least 40% of the examined loci. A higher prevalence of MSI-high phenotype was found in patients with dual malignancies (31.3%) compared with patients with single hematologic (5.6%) or solid malignancy (6.3%) (P = 0.0498 and 0.07, respectively).

Alternative splicing may be associated with human diseases, particularly with cancer, but the molecular disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Convenient, novel methods for multiplexed detection of alternatively spliced transcripts are needed. METHODS: We devised a new approach for detecting splice variants based on a tag-microarray minisequencing system, originally developed for genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We established the system for multiplexed detection of 61 alternatively spliced transcripts in a panel of 19 cancer-related genes and used it to dissect the splicing patterns in cancer and endothelial cells. RESULTS: Our microarray system detected 82% of the splice variants screened for, including both simple and complex splice variants, in at least 1 of the leukemia cell types analyzed. The intraassay CV values for our method ranged from 0.01 to 0.34 (mean, 0.13) for 5 replicate measurements. Our system allowed semiquantitative comparison of the splicing patterns between the cell lines. Similar, but not identical, patterns of alternative splicing were observed among the leukemia cell lines. Size analysis of the PCR products subjected to the tag-array minisequencing system and real-time PCR with exon-junction probes verified the results from the microarray system. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray-based method is a robust and easily accessible tool for parallel detection of alternatively spliced transcripts of multiple genes. It can be used for studying alternative splicing in cancer progression and for following up drug treatment, and it may be a useful tool in clinical diagnostics for cancer and other disorders.","['Milani, Lili', 'Fredriksson, Mona', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine']","['Milani L', 'Fredriksson M', 'Syvanen AC']","['Molecular Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2005/12/31 09:00,2006/03/11 09:00,['2005/12/31 09:00'],"['2005/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2005.062042 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2005.062042 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2006 Feb;52(2):202-11. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2005.062042.

The microcell array with the nanoliter-scale microcells was constructed using simple chemical etching without photolithographic techniques. The positionable dual microelectrodes consisted of the nanometer-to-micrometer-radius Au disk working electrode and a approximately 80-microm-radius Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Peroxidase was chosen as the model enzyme. Factors that concern electrochemical single-cell analysis in microcells such as solution evaporation, interference of soluble oxygen, electrode size, solution volume, and electrode fouling were investigated and discussed. The 20 or 100 nL of detection volume was found to be suitable for peroxidase determination in single neutrophils or single acute promyelocytic leukemia cells without interference from intracellular macromolecules and electrode fouling, when the dual electrode with a 10-microm-radius Au disk working electrode was used. Cells were perforated with digitonin before transferring them into the microcells, to lyse cells easily. The perforated cells were transferred into the microcells by pushing a microscope slide on a drop of the cell suspension on the microcell array. After a single cell in the microcell was lysed using a freeze-thawing technique and allowed to dry, physiological buffer saline containing 2.0 x 10(-3) mol/L hydroquinone and 2.0 x 10(-3) mol/L H2O2 as the substrates of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction was added. The microcell array was positioned in a constant-humidity chamber to prevent evaporation. Then the dual electrode was inserted into the microcell by means of a scanning electrochemical microscope and the product benzoquinone of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction was voltammetrically detected. Peroxidase activity could be quantified using the steady-state current on the voltammogram after subtracting the blank and using the calibration curve.","['Gao, Ning', 'Zhao, Minghui', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Jin, Wenrui']","['Gao N', 'Zhao M', 'Zhang X', 'Jin W']","['School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['*Biosensing Techniques', 'Catalysis', '*Electrochemistry', 'Enzymes, Immobilized', 'Gold/chemistry', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', '*Microelectrodes', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Silver/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",,2005/12/31 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2005/12/31 09:00'],"['2005/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac051178c [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2006 Jan 1;78(1):231-8. doi: 10.1021/ac051178c.,,"['0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: By using Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier analyses, prognostic factors in 54 cases of de novo adult AML with t(8;21) in our institute from 1990 to 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULT: The complete remission (CR) rates were 81.9% for all M2 patients, 82.4% for patients with normal karyotype, 88.5% for patients with t(8;21) [P > 0.05 for normal karyotype vs t(8;21)], 100.0% for 28 patients with t(8;21) alone and 75.0% for 24 patients with additional chromosome abnormalities (P < 0.01). The actuarial 3 year overall survival(OS) was 26% for M2 patients with normal karyotype, 25% for patients with t(8;21) [P > 0.05 for normal karyotype vs t(8;21)], in whole t(8;21) group, 46.4% for patients with t(8;21) alone and 0% for patients with additional chromosome abnormalities (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors showed that chromosome abnormalities besides t(8;21) was the only factor affecting CR, disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. DFS of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and intermediate-dose cytarabine/high dose cytarabine (IDAC) groups were better than the group received routine dose cytarabine as postremission therapy (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: AML with t(8;21) is not a single defined AML subset, and patients with additional chromosome abnormalities have a worse prognosis. HSCT and IDAC could improve the outcome.

METHODS: Sixteen of 298 cases of childhood AL with MLL rearrangements were studied by using MLL dual-color FISH, multiplex RT-PCR with 13 pairs of primers in combination with R banding karyotype analysis and cell immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of childhood AL with MLL rearrangements accounted for 5.4% of 298 AL patients, and 56.3% of infant ALs. Among 106 cases analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR, MLL gene rearrangements were found in 11 cases, including MLL/AF4 fusion gene in 2, MLL/AF6 fusion gene in 1, MLL/AF6 and MLL/ELL combined with MLL/ AFX or HOX11 in one case each, MLL/AF9 in 2, MLL/AF10 in 1, MLL/ELL in 2.

The mice were challenged subcutaneously with 1 x 10(6) FBL3 leukemic cells at day 2 after irradiation. The peripheral WBC count, percentage of EGFP+ cells, subsets of T cells and tumor sizes were monitored. RESULT: Both of the spleen T cell and leukemia specific CTL proliferated efficiently with the percentage of EGFP+ cells of 28. 81% and 42.24%, respectively, after infused into lymphopenic recipients. However, spleen T cells had no anti-leukemia effect regardless of its expansion. In contrast, leukemia specific CTLs showed a more rapid and extensive expansion under the condition of lymphopenia and a enhanced anti-leukemia immunity.

Then the cells were incubated for another 24 h in a medium containing 10 ng/ml of TNF-alpha for maturation of DC. After the total 7 days culture, the cells were harvested as the mRNA-DC and the expression of mature DC markers were determined by FACS. The proliferative capacity of T cell activated by mRNA-DC was determined by MTT assay. Meanwhile, the mRNA-DC was co-cultured with T lymphocytes at a ratio of 1:3 for 7 days. The activated T lymphocytes were harvested, the secretion of IFN-gamma was determined by ELISPOT assay, and the cytotoxicity was analyzed in vitro by LDH release assay. RESULTS: After culture, the BMMNC from 14 AML-CR patients developed morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of mature DC. At a stimulator/reactor ratio of 1:16, auto-T lymphocytes primed with mRNA-DC exhibited significant proliferative activity compared with T lymphocyte primed with non-pulsed DC [(36.84 +/- 5.68)% vs (12.20 +/- 3.16)%, (P < 0.05)].

These results indicate that the alpha-methylsulfanyl substitution increases the cytotoxicity of the C10 and C12 FA toward the studied leukemia cell lines.","['Carballeira, Nestor M', 'Miranda, Carlos', 'Orellano, Elsie A', 'Gonzalez, Fernando A']","['Carballeira NM', 'Miranda C', 'Orellano EA', 'Gonzalez FA']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan 00931-3346. nmcarballeira@uprrp.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Decanoic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatty Acids/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Laurates/chemistry', 'Lauric Acids/pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Sulfur Compounds/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2005/12/31 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2005/12/31 09:00'],"['2005/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11745-005-1470-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 2005 Oct;40(10):1063-8. doi: 10.1007/s11745-005-1470-5.,"['S06 GM008102/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S06GM08102/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Decanoic Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Laurates)', '0 (Lauric Acids)', '0 (Sulfur Compounds)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '1160N9NU9U (lauric acid)', '4G9EDB6V73 (decanoic acid)', '8IPS6BI6KW (lauric acid methyl ester)']",,,PMC1618881,['NIHMS10792'],,,,,,,,,,,

Such data have been traditionally summarized into monthly counts summated over the complete years studied and patterns often examined by use of Pearson's chi(2) tests with 11 degrees of freedom. This test and others commonly used in practice are reviewed. As an alternative, we suggest that by first representing the date of onset for an individual as a point on a unit circle that the von Mises distribution with a single peak may provide a useful description of such data. Further an extension to angular regression including covariates, analogous to that used routinely in other areas of clinical research, potentially allows a more systematic and detailed investigation of possible seasonal patterns in patient subgroups. The methodology is applied to examples from the date of onset of primary angle-closure glaucoma and date of diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and examines in both situations how the peak onset varies with covariates. Difficulties associated with convergence to the maximum likelihood estimates of the associated parameters are described. Finally, we emphasize the need for individualized (rather than grouped) patient data to be available for study, a clear specification of the particular 'onset' time studied, and suggest that further case studies are required to evaluate the approach.","['Gao, Fei', 'Chia, Kee-Seng', 'Krantz, Ingela', 'Nordin, Per', 'Machin, David']","['Gao F', 'Chia KS', 'Krantz I', 'Nordin P', 'Machin D']","['Division of Clinical Trials and Epidemiological Sciences, National Cancer Centre, Singapore. ctegfe@nccs.com.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Glaucoma, Angle-Closure/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leptospirosis/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', '*Regression Analysis', '*Seasons', '*Statistical Distributions']",,2005/12/31 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2005/12/31 09:00'],"['2005/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.2463 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2006 May 15;25(9):1593-618. doi: 10.1002/sim.2463.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of several approaches, use of the lambda phage Red operon is emerging as the most reliable and flexible. The Red operon includes three components: Redalpha, a 5' to 3' exonuclease, Redbeta, an annealing protein, and Redgamma, an inhibitor of the major E. coli exonuclease and recombination complex, RecBCD. Most E. coli cloning hosts are recA deficient to eliminate recombination and therefore enhance the stability of cloned DNAs. However, loss of RecA also impairs general cellular integrity. Here we report that transient RecA co-expression enhances the total number of successful recombinations in bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), mostly because the E. coli host is more able to survive the stresses of DNA transformation procedures. We combined this practical improvement with the advantages of a temperature-sensitive version of the low copy pSC101 plasmid to develop a protocol that is convenient and more efficient than any recombineering procedure, for use of either double- or single-stranded DNA, published to date.","['Wang, Junping', 'Sarov, Mihail', 'Rientjes, Jeanette', 'Fu, Jun', 'Hollak, Heike', 'Kranz, Harald', 'Xie, Wei', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Zhang, Youming']","['Wang J', 'Sarov M', 'Rientjes J', 'Fu J', 'Hollak H', 'Kranz H', 'Xie W', 'Stewart AF', 'Zhang Y']","['Gene Bridges GmbH, BioInnovationsZentrum Dresden, Tatzberg 47-51, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biotechnol,Molecular biotechnology,9423533,IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinose/pharmacology', 'Bacteriophage lambda/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Bacterial/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/genetics', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Operon/*genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Rec A Recombinases/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transformation, Bacterial/genetics']",,2005/12/31 09:00,2006/04/18 09:00,['2005/12/31 09:00'],"['2005/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['MB:32:1:043 [pii]', '10.1385/mb:32:1:043 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biotechnol. 2006 Jan;32(1):43-53. doi: 10.1385/mb:32:1:043.,,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'B40ROO395Z (Arabinose)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rec A Recombinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the results of unrelated donor HCT with bone marrow (n = 85) or cord blood grafts (n = 81) and HLA-matched sibling donor HCT with bone marrow grafts (n = 101) for acute myeloid or acute lymphoblastic leukemia using Cox proportional hazards models. Unrelated donor HCT recipients were younger, more likely to have MLL gene rearrangement, to have advanced leukemia, and to receive irradiation before HCT. RESULTS: Treatment-related mortality rates were 6%, 15%, and 31% after matched sibling, unrelated donor bone marrow, and cord blood HCT, respectively. Risks of relapse, overall and leukemia-free survival were significantly associated with disease status at transplantation. Though leukemia recurrence was lowest after unrelated donor HCT in first clinical remission (CR), overall survival, and leukemia-free survival rates were similar after matched sibling and unrelated donor HCT, after adjustment for disease status. Relapse, overall and leukemia-free survival did not differ by graft type (bone marrow v cord blood) or type of leukemia. Three-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival were 49% and 54% after HLA-matched sibling and unrelated donor transplantation in first CR, respectively. Corresponding rates for those with advanced leukemia were 20% and 30%.

However, which of its numerous target genes are crucial for tumorigenesis remains a frequently contested issue. We have recently established a non-transgenic murine model for B-cell lymphoma based on neoplastic conversion of p53-null bone marrow cells by conditionally active Myc. Using this model, we have identified a number of genes whose expression levels are affected by Myc during B-lymphomagenesis. Here we discuss their possible roles in neoplastic processes and describe an experimental approach allowing in vivo validation of these roles. We demonstrate that lymphoma cells overexpressing one of the Myc targets, the interleukin-10 receptor gene, have a very strong selective advantage over low IL10R expressors. Furthermore, Mcl1, a presumptive IL10R effector, also confers selective advantages when overexpressed in Myc-transformed hematopoietic cells. Thus, both IL10R and Mcl1 might be amenable to therapeutic interventions, and new targets can be identified and validated using the selection approach.","['Yu, Duonan', 'Cozma, Diana', 'Park, Andrea', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko, Andrei']","['Yu D', 'Cozma D', 'Park A', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko A']","['Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6051, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-10', 'Retroviridae/metabolism']",,2005/12/31 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2005/12/31 09:00'],"['2005/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['1059/1/145 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1339.047 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Nov;1059:145-59. doi: 10.1196/annals.1339.047.,"['R01 CA102709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA097932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 097932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 102709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-10)']",,,PMC1490324,['NIHMS10763'],,,,,,,,,,,

Increased dose density is achieved by reducing the interval between each dose of chemotherapy. The cumulative drug dose remains constant, but the same amount of drug is administered over a shorter period. Mathematical models of tumor growth have provided the basis for the clinical application of dose-dense chemotherapy. The Norton-Simon model suggests that increasing the dose density of chemotherapy will increase efficacy by minimizing the opportunity for regrowth of tumor cells between cycles of chemotherapy. Intergroup trial 9741, coordinated by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), tested the 2 hypotheses that dose-dense and sequential administration of chemotherapy regimens incorporating doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel would improve disease-free survival and overall survival. A statistically significant 4-year disease-free survival advantage was detected for the 2 dose-dense regimens compared with the regimens administered every 3 weeks.

We identified 29 cases with late pre-B immune phenotype, 19 cases with common pre B and 6 cases with early preB immunophenotype. Eleven, patients also displayed myeloid antigens. A significant association (p=0.034) was found between early treatment response and the presence of myeloid antigens. No association was found between the pre-B immunophenotype, age and leukocyte count with early treatment response (p=0.264). CONCLUSIONS: We need to pay special emphasis on early treatment response in children with lymphoblast leukemia as our study did not corroborate the common finding that clinical factors and immune phenotype can be predictive factors.","['Correa-Gonzalez, Lourdes Cecilia', 'Mandeville, Peter B', 'Manrique-Duenas, Javier', 'Alejo-Gonzalez, Francisco', 'Salazar-Martinez, Abel', 'de Perez-Ramirez, Oscar Jesus', 'Hernandez-Sierra, Juan Francisco']","['Correa-Gonzalez LC', 'Mandeville PB', 'Manrique-Duenas J', 'Alejo-Gonzalez F', 'Salazar-Martinez A', 'de Perez-Ramirez OJ', 'Hernandez-Sierra JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, San Luis Potosi, S.L.P.

The finding of space-time clustering indicates the presence of an environmental component to aetiology and is especially supportive of a role for infections. Space-time clustering occurs when excess numbers of cases of a disease are observed within small geographical locations at limited periods of time and this cannot be explained in terms of general excesses in those locations or at those times. To investigate whether infections may be involved in the aetiology of childhood cancer, we have analysed for space-time clustering using a large set of national population-based data from Great Britain for the period 1969-1993. Data were examined by a second-order procedure based on K-functions, with fixed thresholds of closeness in space (0.5-7.5 km) and closeness in time (0.1-1.5 years). Locations were addresses at diagnosis. Tests were repeated, replacing geographical distances with distances to the 19th-33rd nearest neighbours and this provided the primary result for each analysis. There were a total of 32,295 cases of childhood cancer. The analyses showed statistically significant evidence of space-time clustering for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia over the whole age range (p = 0.04), but especially for ages 1-4 years (p = 0.03). There was less statistically significant evidence for total leukaemia (p = 0.048). Significant space-time clustering was also evident for soft tissue sarcomas (p = 0.03) and osteosarcomas (p = 0.02). Results support other evidence suggesting a role for infections in the aetiology of these particular diagnostic groups.","['McNally, Richard J Q', 'Alexander, Freda E', 'Bithell, John F']","['McNally RJ', 'Alexander FE', 'Bithell JF']","['School of Clinical Medical Sciences (Child Health) and School of Population and Health Sciences, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2005/12/29 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2005/12/29 09:00'],"['2005/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21726 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Jun 1;118(11):2840-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21726.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report aims to characterize trends in incidence of childhood cancer, and to assess the implications of these trends by generating incidence projections to 2015. Cancer incidence data were obtained from the database of the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO), which has registered all cancer cases in Ontario since 1985. Annual incidence rates were calculated with census-based population estimates for the 1986-2001 period. Poisson regression models were used to analyze trends, and to calculate projected numbers of cases up to the year 2015. From 1986 to 2001, 5,163 cancer cases occurred among children aged 0-14. Leukemia, CNS tumors and lymphomas were the most common cancers. The number of incident cases increased by 14%, from 296 in 1986 to 336 in 2001. For all cancers, average annual age-standardized rates increased from 147 per million in 1991 to 157 per million in 2001. Over the next 15 years, the 0-14 year population is expected to decrease from 2.28 million in 2000 to 2.13 million in 2015. A marginally statistically significant trend in incidence was projected for all cancers combined (0.5% increase per year p < 0.10) and a statistically significant increase for lymphomas, (1.2% per year 95% CI = 0.0-3.9%). During this period, the number of cases of leukemia and CNS tumors is expected to remain relatively stable. The number of cases of all cancers is expected to increase by 8%, from the average of 320 in 1995 to approximately 347 in 2015. Understanding of these projections will facilitate health care resource planning.","['Agha, Mohammed', 'DiMonte, Bruna', 'Greenberg, Mark', 'Greenberg, Corin', 'Barr, Ronald', 'McLaughlin, John R']","['Agha M', 'DiMonte B', 'Greenberg M', 'Greenberg C', 'Barr R', 'McLaughlin JR']","['Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data']",,2005/12/29 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2005/12/29 09:00'],"['2005/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21567 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Jun 1;118(11):2809-15. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21567.,,,['Int J Cancer. 2006 Jun 1;118(11):2651.

However, AML1-ETO alone cannot induce AML and thus additional genetic events are required for the onset of AML. The Wilms tumor gene (WT1), which has been identified as the gene responsible for Wilms tumor, is expressed at high levels in almost all human leukemias. In this study, we have generated transgenic mice (WT1-Tg) that overexpress WT1 in hematopoietic cells to investigate the effects of WT1 on AML1-ETO-associated leukemogenesis. AML1-ETO-transduced bone marrow (BM) cells from WT1-Tg mice exhibited inhibition of myeloid differentiation at more immature stages and higher in vitro colony-forming ability compared with AML1-ETO-transduced BM cells from wild-type mice. Most importantly, all of the mice that received a transplant of AML1-ETO-transduced BM cells from the WT1-Tg mice rapidly developed AML.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that G-CSF modulates donor T cell function before transplantation, promoting T(H)2 differentiation and regulatory T cell function. In addition, the expansion of immature antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) favors the maintenance of this pattern of T cell differentiation after transplantation. Although these patterns of T cell differentiation attenuate acute GVHD, they do not have an impact on the cytolytic pathways of the CD8(+) T cells that are critical for effective GVL. Recently, it has been demonstrated that modification of G-CSF, either by pegylation of the native cytokine or conjugation to Flt-3L, results in the expansion and activation of donor iNKT cells, which significantly augment CD8(+) T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and GVL effects after transplantation. Given that these cytokines also enhance the expansion of regulatory T cells and APCs, they further separate GVHD and GVL, offering potential clinical advantages for the transplant recipient.","['Morris, Edward S', 'MacDonald, Kelli P A', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['Morris ES', 'MacDonald KP', 'Hill GR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, 300 Herston Rd, Herston, QLD 4029, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects/immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",62,2005/12/29 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2005/12/29 09:00'],"['2005/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65515-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-10-4299 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3430-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-10-4299.

The mechanism underlying the activation, however, is not fully understood. Here, we have identified the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 as a potent tBid-binding partner. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that the Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 domain of tBid is essential for binding to Mcl-1, whereas all three BH domains (BH1, BH2, and BH3) of Mcl-1 are required for interaction with tBid. In vitro studies using isolated mitochondria and recombinant proteins demonstrate that Mcl-1 strongly inhibits tBid-induced cytochrome c release. In addition to its ability to interact directly with Bax and Bak, tBid also binds Mcl-1 and displaces Bak from the Mcl-1-Bak complex. Importantly, overexpression of Mcl-1 confers resistance to the induction of apoptosis by both TRAIL and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in HeLa cells, whereas targeting Mcl-1 by RNA interference sensitizes HeLa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, our study demonstrates a novel regulation of tBid by Mcl-1 through protein-protein interaction in apoptotic signaling from death receptors to mitochondria.","['Clohessy, John G', 'Zhuang, Jianguo', 'de Boer, Jasper', 'Gil-Gomez, Gabriel', 'Brady, Hugh J M']","['Clohessy JG', 'Zhuang J', 'de Boer J', 'Gil-Gomez G', 'Brady HJ']","['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, University College London, 30 Guilford Street, London WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,2005/12/29 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2005/12/29 09:00'],"['2005/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)76703-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M505688200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Mar 3;281(9):5750-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M505688200.

METHODS: Hematologic examinations and bone marrow G-banding karyotyping were evaluated at regular intervals in 3 patients with Ph(+)CML who achieved hematologic responses during continuous imatinib therapy, including 1 patient in first chronic phase (case 1), 1 patient in second chronic phase (case 2) and 1 patient in accelerated phase (case 3). RESULTS: Case 1, case 2 and case 3 achieved complete cytogenetic response after 4, 3 and 6 months of imatinib therapy respectively. Though under continuously imatinib treatment, they developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia and extramedullary blast crisis in the following 12, 6 and 0 months respectively. Cytogenetic studies of bone marrow in the crisis period showed that cells in case 1 and case 3 had a complete cytogenetic response (Ph(+)cell=0), but case 2 had 20% Ph(+) cells.

Because HSC are capable of initiating long-term hematopoiesis, injury to these cells during pregnancy may play a role in the development of hematopoietic disorders manifested after birth. Of interest is the role of genetic injury to fetal HSC in the etiology of the infant acute leukemias, which are characterized by chromosomal rearrangements in the 11q23 region involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. These gene fusions also occur in leukemias in adults following chemotherapy with etoposide and other inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II. We used etoposide as a model compound to determine the sensitivity of human fetal HSC to DNA damage and to determine whether we could induce MLL rearrangements in cultured human fetal HSC. Exposure of HSC to etoposide resulted in a dose-dependent loss of viability, with effects observed at low nanomolar concentrations. DNA strand breaks were observed on exposure to 140 nM etoposide, and higher etoposide concentrations stimulated an increase in early lymphoid populations and elicited G2/M cell cycle arrest. Immunophenotyping of MLL translocations revealed a significant increase in positive flow cytometry events at low etoposide concentrations and were consistent with MLL recombination. MLL translocations were confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization. In vitro inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II was observed at >or=25 microM etoposide, but was not evident at lower etoposide concentrations associated with DNA damage. Our data indicate that low acute doses of etoposide can cause DNA strand breaks and chromosomal rearrangements involving MLL in human fetal HSC. Ultimately, such injury may have ramifications with regards to transplacental exposures to environmental chemicals linked to the etiology of infant acute leukemias.","['Moneypenny, Craig G', 'Shao, Jing', 'Song, Yanyu', 'Gallagher, Evan P']","['Moneypenny CG', 'Shao J', 'Song Y', 'Gallagher EP']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Gene Rearrangement/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Pregnancy']",,2005/12/27 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2005/12/27 09:00'],"['2005/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgi322 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgi322 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2006 Apr;27(4):874-81. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgi322.

The in vitro experiments revealed that the intracellular accumulation of telithromycin in adriamycin-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/ADR) overexpressing P glycoprotein was significantly lower than that in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/S) not expressing P glycoprotein. Cyclosporine significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of telithromycin in K562/ADR cells. When telithromycin was coadministered intravenously with cyclosporine in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, cyclosporine significantly delayed the disappearance of telithromycin from plasma and decreased its systemic clearance to 60% of the corresponding control values. Hepatobiliary excretion experiments revealed that cyclosporine almost completely inhibited the biliary clearance of telithromycin, suggesting that telithromycin is a substrate of P glycoprotein and a potential substrate of Mrp2. Moreover, the biliary clearance of telithromycin was significantly decreased by 80% in Eisai hyperbilirubinemic mutant rats with a hereditary deficiency in Mrp2, indicating that Mrp2, as well as P glycoprotein, plays an important role in the biliary excretion of telithromycin. When the effect of telithromycin on the biliary excretion of doxorubicin, a substrate of P glycoprotein and Mrp2, was examined in SD rats, telithromycin significantly decreased the biliary clearance of doxorubicin by 80%. Results obtained from this study indicate that telithromycin is a substrate of both P glycoprotein and Mrp2, and these transporters are involved in the hepatobiliary transport of telithromycin.","['Yamaguchi, Shoji', 'Zhao, Ying Lan', 'Nadai, Masayuki', 'Yoshizumi, Hideo', 'Cen, Xiaobo', 'Torita, Shoko', 'Takagi, Kenji', 'Takagi, Kenzo', 'Hasegawa, Takaaki']","['Yamaguchi S', 'Zhao YL', 'Nadai M', 'Yoshizumi H', 'Cen X', 'Torita S', 'Takagi K', 'Takagi K', 'Hasegawa T']","['Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University School of Health Sciences, Daikominami, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Ketolides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Liver/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,2005/12/27 09:00,2006/04/01 09:00,['2005/12/27 09:00'],"['2005/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['50/1/80 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.50.1.80-87.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Jan;50(1):80-7. doi: 10.1128/AAC.50.1.80-87.2006.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Abcc2 protein, rat)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ketolides)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'KI8H7H19WL (telithromycin)']",,,PMC1346787,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such finding was supported by corresponding increase of cells with low mitochondrial membrane potential, high superoxide production, increased intracellular calcium concentration, and phosphorylation of histone H2AX after sonication. Optimal ultrasound condition was 0.3W/cm(2), 1MHz, 10% duty factor pulsed at 100Hz; but in the presence of Levovist, an apparent shift of cell killing induction was observed at 0.2W/cm(2).

Many of these processes take place in specialized compartments of the nucleus. One of such sub-nuclear compartments is the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML NB). In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), PML forms a fusion protein with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha as a result of chromosomal translocation. This PML-RAR alpha fusion protein is responsible for the proliferative and de-differentiated phenotype of the leukemic cells and is the target of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Another example of the specialized sub-nuclear compartments important in the targeting of cancer is the nucleolus. Recently, it has been proposed that the nucleolus serves as a stress sensor for the cell, and the molecular mechanism underlying this proposal has been discovered. Moreover, many anti-cancer drugs target specific protein-protein interactions within the nucleus. We will discuss current development surrounding two such target proteins: the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) and FKBP25. Furthermore, chromatin structure, which is affected by modifications of core histones, has become a target of anti-cancer drugs. In this review, we will emphasize the significance of nuclear proteins as promising targets for cancer drug therapy by discussing a few key ideas, in three broad categories of specialized sub-nuclear compartments, protein-protein interactions, and the modifications of the chromatin structure.","['Yao, Y-L', 'Yang, W-M']","['Yao YL', 'Yang WM']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/metabolism']",148,2005/12/27 09:00,2006/01/26 09:00,['2005/12/27 09:00'],"['2005/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156800905774932815 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2005 Dec;5(8):595-610. doi: 10.2174/156800905774932815.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '147478-69-1 (FKBP3 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metastatic tumors in the heart are rarely clinically symptomatic, and, therefore, they are rarely diagnosed within the lifetime. They are mostly diagnosed at autopsy. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of metastatic tumors of the heart, their primary localization, as well as the localization of the metastases found in the autopsic material within the period 1972-2004. METHODS: During the autopsy of the patients died of metastatic tumors, we microscopically and macroscopically analyzed all the organs and tissues to determine the metastases of primary tumors in other organs, especially in the heart and pericardium. RESULTS: Within the period from 1972-2004, 11 403 autopsies were performed. In 2 928 (25.6%) out of 11 403 autopsies, the presence of malignant tumor was diagnosed, and in 79 (2.7%) of these cases, metastasis of the heart was found out. Only in 5 of the cases, the presence of metastasis in the heart was diagnosed during the lifetime. The most frequent metastases in the heart were caused by pulmonary carcinoma (18 cases), leukemia and malignant lymphoma (8 cases, each), then pancreatic and breast carcinoma, while the metastases of other carcinomas were rather rare. In 40 (60.76%) cases, the metastasis was localized in the myocardium, but more often in the left ventricle, in 24 (30.38%) cases in the pericardium, in 4 cases in the epicardium and in the 3 of them in the mitral and tricuspid valve. Only in one case of renal carcionoma, metastasis was found in the right atrium and it occurred by spreading (dissemination) through the lumen of the inferior vena cava. CONCLUSION: Metastatic tumors of the heart are rather rare, and rarely clinically symptomatic, and, thus, rarely diagnosed during life. The methods of choice for the diagnosis of the metastasis in the heart are echocardiography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, cytological analysis of the pericardial effusion and biopsy. The treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","['Rafajlovski, Saso', 'Tatic, Vujadin', 'Ilic, Srbislav', 'Kanjuh, Vladimir']","['Rafajlovski S', 'Tatic V', 'Ilic S', 'Kanjuh V']","['Vojnomedicinska akademija, Klinika za urgentnu internu medicinu, Beograd.']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Heart Neoplasms/diagnosis/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2005/12/27 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/12/27 09:00'],"['2005/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/vsp0512915r [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2005 Dec;62(12):915-20. doi: 10.2298/vsp0512915r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve those goals, it is of interest to discover the gene interaction networks, and perhaps even pathways, underlying given diseases from such data. In this paper, we consider methods for efficiently discovering highly differentiative gene groups (HDGG), which may provide insights on gene interaction networks. HDGGs are groups of genes which completely or nearly completely characterize the diseased or normal tissues. Discovering HDGGs is challenging, due to the high dimensionality of the data. RESULTS: Our methods are based on the novel concept of gene clubs. A gene club consists of a set of genes having high potential to be interactive with each other. The methods can (i) efficiently discover signature HDGGs which completely characterize the diseased and the normal tissues respectively, (ii) find strongest or near strongest HDGGs containing any given gene, and (iii) find much stronger HDGGs than previous methods. As part of the experimental evaluation, the methods are applied to colon, prostate, ovarian, and breast cancer, and leukemia and so on. Some of the genes in the extracted signature HDGGs have known biological functions, and some have attracted little attention in biology and medicine.

The newly isolated strain was able to produce a large amount of actinomycin X2 even under nonoptimized growing conditions and serves as a promising source of this antibiotic. Actinomycin X2 has higher cytotoxicity toward cultured human leukemia (HL-60) cells than does actinomycin D, and it induces cell death via apoptosis. A nearly complete 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence from the isolate was determined and found to have high identity (98.5-100%) with Streptomyces galbus, Streptomyces griseofuscus, and Streptomyces padanus, indicating that MITKK-103 belongs to the genus Streptomyces. The isolate clustered with species belonging to the S. padanus clade in a 16S-rDNA-based phylogenetic tree and showed 75% overall homology to S. padanus ATCC 25646 in DNA-DNA relatedness analysis. Although the growth of the isolate was somewhat different from the three species mentioned, the strain MITKK-103 most closely resembles S. padanus on the basis of the morphological and phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis, and genotypic data.

The substantial reports demonstrated that commonly used hypoxia-mimetic agents cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)) and desferrioxamine (DFO) could also induce apoptosis in many different kinds of cells, but the mechanism was poorly understood. In this work, we compare the apoptosis-inducing effects of these two hypoxia-mimetic agents with acute myeloid leukemic cell lines NB4 and U937 as in vitro models. The results show that both of them induce these leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials (DeltaPsi m), the activation of caspase-3/8 and the cleavage of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, together with the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein, a critical regulator for the cellular response to hypoxia. Metavanadate and sodium nitroprusside significantly abrogate DFO rather than CoCl(2)-induced mitochondrial Delta Psi m collapse, caspase-3/8 activation, Mcl-1 cleavage and apoptosis, but they fail to influence DFO and CoCl(2)-induced HIF-1alpha protein accumulation. Moreover, inducible expression of HIF-1alpha gene dose not alter DFO and CoCl(2)-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. In conclusion, these results propose that although both DFO and CoCl(2)-induced leukemic cell apoptosis by mitochondrial pathway-dependent and HIF-1alpha-independent mechanisms, DFO and CoCl(2)-induced apoptosis involves different initiating signal pathways that remain to be investigated.","['Guo, M', 'Song, L-P', 'Jiang, Y', 'Liu, W', 'Yu, Y', 'Chen, G-Q']","['Guo M', 'Song LP', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu W', 'Yu Y', 'Chen GQ']","['Health Science Center, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cobalt/*pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-005-3085-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Jan;11(1):67-77. doi: 10.1007/s10495-005-3085-3.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, several drugs play their anticancer effect through Fas apoptotic pathway. So we investigated the effect of MMA on Fas signaling. In this study we show that MMA induces apoptosis in Fas sensitive Jurkat cells and Fas resistant KG1a cells. This effect involves Fas apoptotic pathway: cell exposure to MMA leads to Fas clustering at the cell surface, DISC (Death Inducing Signaling Complex) formation and caspase cleavage. This phenomenon is independent of Fas ligand/Fas interaction and blockade of Fas death pathway partially inhibits MMA-induced apoptosis. Moreover the activation of Fas apoptotic pathway by MMA is correlated to the modulation of c-Flip(L) expression. Finally, pre-treatment with sub-lethal doses of MMA sensitizes KG1a cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Thus all these results may have important implications to improve clinical treatments.","['Leroy, I', 'Laurent, G', 'Quillet-Mary, A']","['Leroy I', 'Laurent G', 'Quillet-Mary A']","['INSERM U563/CPTP, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Plicamycin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-005-3089-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Jan;11(1):113-9. doi: 10.1007/s10495-005-3089-z.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '97666-60-9 (mithramycin A)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding of the impact of mutations has been limited by an inability to express human perforin in vitro. We have shown, for the first time to our knowledge, that recombinant human perforin is expressed, processed appropriately, and functional in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells following retroviral transduction. Subsequently, we have addressed how perforin missense mutations lead to absent perforin detection and impaired cytotoxicity by analyzing 21 missense mutations by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblot. We identified perforin missense mutations with partial maturation (class 1), no apparent proteolytic maturation (class 2), and no recognizable forms of perforin (class 3). Class 1 mutations exhibit lytic function when expressed in RBL cells and are associated with residual protein detection and variable cytotoxic function in affected individuals, suggesting that carriers of class 1 alleles may exhibit more subtle immune defects. By contrast, class 3 mutations cause severely diminished perforin detection and cytotoxicity, while class 2 mutations have an intermediate phenotype. Thus, the pathologic mechanism of perforin missense mutation likely involves a protein dosage effect of the mature protein.","['Risma, Kimberly A', 'Frayer, Robert W', 'Filipovich, Alexandra H', 'Sumegi, Janos']","['Risma KA', 'Frayer RW', 'Filipovich AH', 'Sumegi J']","[""Division of Allergy/Immunology and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Cell Line', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI26217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2006 Jan;116(1):182-92. doi: 10.1172/JCI26217.

This study aims to reflect on such genetic mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Slides from short term cultures or direct smears of blood, bone marrow and amniotic fluids were hybridized with FISH probes singly, combined or sequentially. Two to three hundred cells were examined from each preparation. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: A small number of cells (up to about 5%), more frequent in leukemia cases, showed the twin features: (1) nuclei with biphasic chromatin, one part decondensed and the other condensed; and (2) homologous FISH signals distributed equitably in those two regions. The biphasic chromatin structure with equitable distribution of the homologous FISH signals may correspond to the two sets of chromosomes, supporting observations on ploidywise intranuclear order. The decondensed chromatin may relate to enhanced transcriptions or advanced replications. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptions of only one of the two parental genomes cause allelic exclusion. Genomes may switch with alternating monoallelic expression of biallelic genes as an efficient genetic mechanism. If genomes fail to switch, allelic exclusion may lead to malignancy. Similarly, a genome-wide monoallelic replication may tilt the balance of heterozygosity resulting in aneusomy, initiating early events in malignant transformation and in predicting cancer mortality.","['Chaudhuri, Jyoti P', 'Kasprzycki, Eva', 'Battaglia, Mathew', 'McGill, John R', 'Brogger, Anton', 'Walther, Joachim-U', 'Reith, Albrecht']","['Chaudhuri JP', 'Kasprzycki E', 'Battaglia M', 'McGill JR', 'Brogger A', 'Walther JU', 'Reith A']","['Tumour Cytogenetic Unit, Kinderklinik, LMU, 80336 Munich, Germany.

As a cellular model, we selected MOLT-4 human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells that overexpress survivin and nonfunctional p53. Treatment with melphalan, a classic DNA-damaging agent, led to the induction of the DNA damage checkpoint and growth arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Checkpoint abrogation by caffeine was accompanied by mitotic entry and rapid apoptotic cell death, whereas cells remaining in G2 remained viable during the same time interval. Unexpectedly, when the spindle checkpoint was activated following G2 abrogation, two different effects could be observed. If the microtubules of the melphalan-treated cells were destabilized by nocodazole, cells became arrested in prometaphase with low survivin levels and entered apoptosis. In contrast, if the microtubules of the melphalan-treated cells were stabilized by taxol, cells were still arrested in prometaphase, but apoptotic execution was inhibited. This effect is, most likely, directly mediated by survivin itself given its well-established antiapoptotic functions. In conclusion, depending on the way the spindle checkpoint was activated in cells with damaged DNA, cells could be either protected by survivin or die during mitosis. We suggest that the efficacy of DNA damage checkpoint abrogators used in combination with DNA-damaging agents may critically depend on whether DNA damage is able to invoke spindle checkpoint response and to activate survivin-associated survival signaling during mitosis.","['Bozko, Przemyslaw', 'Sabisz, Michal', 'Larsen, Annette K', 'Skladanowski, Andrzej']","['Bozko P', 'Sabisz M', 'Larsen AK', 'Skladanowski A']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Narutowicza Street 11/12, 80-952 Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Survival', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/12/2016 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0138 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Dec;4(12):2016-25. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0138.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that all three compounds inhibited the proliferation of HL60 and U937 cells, with IC50s ranging from 3.6 to 10.9 micromol/L after treatment for 6 days. These growth inhibitory effects correlated with externalization of phosphatidylserine and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that these isomeric steroids induce apoptosis in leukemia cells. z-VAD-fmk prevented phosphatidylserine externalization but not mitochondrial membrane potential loss, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction occurred in the absence of caspase activation. Interestingly, although all three compounds increased the generation of reactive oxygen species and decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, only cis-guggulsterone induced a rapid depletion of reduced glutathione levels and oxidation of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. 16-Dehydroprogesterone and trans-guggulsterone induced differentiation of HL60 and NB4 cells as evidenced by increased surface expression of CD11b and/or CD14, and all three steroids rapidly induced mitochondrial dysfunction and phosphatidylserine externalization of CD34-positive blasts from primary leukemic samples.

ZNRD1 was found overexpressed in the vincristine-induced MDR leukemia cell HL-60/vincristine moreso than its parental cell HL-60. Up-regulation of ZNRD1 expression could confer resistance of both P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-related and P-gp-nonrelated drugs on HL-60 cells and suppress Adriamycin-induced apoptosis accompanied by decreased accumulation and increased releasing amount of Adriamycin. ZNRD1 could significantly up-regulate the expression of P-gp, Bcl-2, and the transcription of the MDR1 gene but not alter the expression of MDR-associated protein, glutathione S-transferase activity, or intracellular glutathione content in leukemia cells. In addition, inhibition of ZNRD1 expression by RNA interference or P-gp inhibitor could partially reverse ZNRD1-mediated MDR. The further study of the biological functions of ZNRD1 may be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of MDR of leukemia and developing possible strategies to treat leukemia.","['Hong, Liu', 'Piao, Ying', 'Han, Yu', 'Wang, Jun', 'Zhang, Xiaoyin', 'Du, Yulei', 'Cao, Shanshan', 'Qiao, Taidong', 'Chen, Zhen', 'Fan, Daiming']","['Hong L', 'Piao Y', 'Han Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhang X', 'Du Y', 'Cao S', 'Qiao T', 'Chen Z', 'Fan D']","[""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Institute of Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/12/1936 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0182 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Dec;4(12):1936-42. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0182.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (POLR1H protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of the 36 patients was PCR-negative at last follow-up. Thus, none of the low-risk patients has received chemotherapy, and only 3 high-risk patients (the 3 with relapsed disease) have received chemotherapy past induction. ATRA plus ATO may serve as an alternative to chemotherapy in low-risk untreated APL (eg, in older patients) and, when combined with GO, may improve outcome in high-risk patients.","['Estey, Elihu', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Jones, Dan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Estey E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Faderl S', 'Verstovsek S', 'Jones D', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe, Box 428, Houston, 77030, USA. ehestey@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65523-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-10-4006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3469-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-10-4006.

There is evidence that oxidant stress contributes to Hcy's deleterious effects on the vasculature. The accumulation and adhesion of monocytes to the vascular endothelium is a critical event in the development of atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of Hcy on the interaction between human endothelial cells (EC) (EC line EA.hy 926 and primary human umbilical vein EC [HUVEC]) and the monocytic cell line THP-1, and the impact of vascular oxidant stress and redox-sensitive signaling pathways on these events. METHODS AND RESULTS: L-Hcy, but not D-Hcy, increases the production of reactive oxygen species inside EC, enhances nuclear factor(NF)-kappaB activation, and stimulates intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) RNA transcription and cell surface expression. This leads to a time- and dose-dependent increase in monocyte adhesion to ECs. Pretreatment of ECs with superoxide scavengers (MnTBAP and Tiron) or with an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation abolished Hcy-induced monocyte adhesion, ICAM-1 expression, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that reactive oxygen species produced under hyperhomocysteinemic conditions may induce a proinflammatory situation in the vessel wall that initiates and promotes atherosclerotic lesion development.","['Postea, Otilia', 'Krotz, Florian', 'Henger, Anna', 'Keller, Christiane', 'Weiss, Norbert']","['Postea O', 'Krotz F', 'Henger A', 'Keller C', 'Weiss N']","['Medical Policlinic, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,IM,"['Atherosclerosis/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism', 'Homocysteine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vasculitis/immunology/metabolism']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.ATV.0000201039.21705.dc [pii]', '10.1161/01.ATV.0000201039.21705.dc [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2006 Mar;26(3):508-13. doi: 10.1161/01.ATV.0000201039.21705.dc.

About 50% of the patients are not eligible for aggressive chemotherapy (CT) and are only managed with conservative approaches. Results in this subset of patients have not been reported so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 244 consecutive elderly AML patients (M/F 143/101, median age 72 years, range 60-90) diagnosed at our institution from January 1989 to December 1998 and not eligible for intensive CT. Eighty-nine patients (36.5%) had evolved from previous myelodysplasia (sAML). Fifty-three out of 192 (26.4%) patients with available bone marrow (BM) analysis had oligoblastic leukaemia (blasts<40% and WBC<15x10(9)/l). RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (27.5%) were managed with supportive treatment only. One hundred seventy-seven patients (72.5%), in order to control disease, received conservative CT, consisting of Hydroxyurea (HU) (127 patients, 71.7%), Cytarabine and 6-Thioguanine (39 patients, 22%) or low-dose cytarabine (11 patients, 6.3%). Median overall survival was 179 days (1-3278) with 50 patients (20.5%) surviving>12 months. Older age (>75 years), poor WHO PS (>2), lower PLT levels (<50x10(9)/l) and higher absolute peripheral blast count (>5x10(9)/l) showed a negative prognostic impact on survival in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data outline the great heterogeneity of elderly AML patients not eligible for intensive CT. A simple scoring system including easily evaluable parameters, which could distinguish subjects with different prognosis, is proposed. Moreover, randomized studies in order to establish best conservative approaches are warranted.","['Latagliata, R', 'Bongarzoni, V', 'Carmosino, I', 'Mengarelli, A', 'Breccia, M', 'Borza, P A', ""D'Andrea, M"", ""D'Elia, G M"", 'Mecarocci, S', 'Morano, S G', 'Petti, M C', 'Mandelli, F', 'Alimena, G']","['Latagliata R', 'Bongarzoni V', 'Carmosino I', 'Mengarelli A', 'Breccia M', 'Borza PA', ""D'Andrea M"", ""D'Elia GM"", 'Mecarocci S', 'Morano SG', 'Petti MC', 'Mandelli F', 'Alimena G']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza di Roma, Ematologia, Ospedale S.

Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 are members of a family of inducible intracellular proteins that negatively regulate cytokine signaling in cells of hematopoietic origin and may influence the Th1 to Th2 balance. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 are induced by cytokines that are known to be up-regulated during EAE, including IFN-gamma (IFN-g) and IL-6, respectively. To test the hypothesis that the level of induction of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 correlates with the course of EAE, mRNA levels were compared in spinal cords of SJL and B6 mice during discrete stages of disease. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 were elevated throughout active disease in both strains. At peak EAE, SOCS-1 was higher and SOCS-3 was lower in B6 cords compared with SJL cords. This correlated with greater expression of the Th1 cytokine, IFN-g, and less of the Th2 cytokine, IL-10, in B6 cords relative to SJL cords during onset and peak disease. SOCS-3 inducers in the IL-6 family were expressed differentially between the strains. IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor were higher at onset in B6 cords whereas ciliary neurotrophic factor was increased in SJL cords during peak disease. Expression of fibroblast growth factor-2, which may be involved in remyelination, was higher in SJL cords at peak. Comparison of these models suggests that cytokine autoregulatory mechanisms involving SOCS may play a role in determining the course of EAE.","['Stark, Jennifer L', 'Cross, Anne H']","['Stark JL', 'Cross AH']","['Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

Harnessing the immune system to recognise and destroy tumours is a promising new approach to treating these diseases. Dendritic cells (DC) are unique antigen-presenting cells that play a central role in the initiation and direction of immune responses. DC loaded ex vivo with tumour-associated antigens and administered as a vaccine have already shown promise in early clinical trials for a number of lymphoproliferative disorders, but the need for improvement is widely agreed. Recent advances in the understanding of basic DC biology and lessons from early clinical trials have provided exciting new insights into the generation of anti-tumour immune responses and the design of vaccine strategies. In this review we provide an overview of our current understanding of DC biology and their function in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders.

Whilst conventional cytogenetics remains the most comprehensive method for assessing chromosome abnormalities, the technical difficulties associated with conventional cytogenetics in most lymphomas has resulted in increased use of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to identify specific abnormalities that are useful in either the diagnosis or management of these disorders. The finding of one of the Burkitt's translocations is of major importance in the diagnosis of Burkitt's and Burkitt's-like lymphomas, whereas the t(14;18), although seen in most follicular lymphomas (FL), is not usually required to make a diagnosis. Thus, whilst cytogenetics may be of interest in FL, it is not an essential part of the diagnostic work-up. Conventional cytogenetics may be useful for identifying markers of resistance to Helicobacter pylori therapy in MALT lymphomas. In disorders such as Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukaemia and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, although many cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed, no consistent or specific abnormalities have been identified and so, at this point in our knowledge of the genetics of these disorders, cytogenetics cannot be considered a useful test for either diagnosis or prognosis. In contrast, the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma is now dependent upon the identification of the 11;14 translocation that results in cyclin D1 up-regulation. It is widely acknowledged that FISH is the most consistently useful test to identify the juxtaposition of the CCND1 and IGH genes in mantle cell lymphoma and is regarded as the 'gold standard'. FISH also has a role in identifying genetic abnormalities of prognostic significance in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Given the wealth of genetic and cytogenetic abnormalities that are continuing to be found in chronic lymphoid malignancies, it will be some time before the optimal use of both conventional cytogenetics and FISH is established in the diagnosis and management of lymphomas.","['Campbell, Lynda J']",['Campbell LJ'],"[""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.

This has been driven by the recommendation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence that diagnosis of leukaemia and lymphoma should take place in a specialist laboratory and in most cases this should be organised on a regional basis. The reason for this guidance was the perception that there was a considerable level of diagnostic inaccuracy and that this could be improved by better integration of the currently available technologies. This is one of a number of major changes in the way that services to patients are being delivered, all of which are centred on the development of multidisciplinary teams responsible for the provision of local services. The introduction of the WHO classification of haematological malignancy provides a structure for the development of integrated haemtopathology laboratories, with its emphasis on definition of disease entities based on clinical, morphological, phenotypical and molecular features. This means that these diagnostic modalities can be used systematically and in parallel to provide effective cross validation of a diagnosis. One of the challenges raised by this approach is the selection of the most informative panels of investigations both at presentation and subsequent follow up from the wide range of options that are now available. The introduction of specialist haematopathology services in the United Kingdom has highlighted a number of scientific and organisational issues that in time may have a wider impact on diagnostic laboratories in general. These include the relationship between size and cost effectiveness and the future role of clinical scientists and medically trained pathologists. Integrated laboratories of the type being developed challenge the prevailing model for delivery of pathological services in the United Kingdom, which is based around the traditional pathology disciplines. These speciality boundaries will become less relevant as long established diagnostic techniques are replaced by the new generation of diagnostic technologies and it is important to establish frameworks of service delivery that can deploy these developments for the benefit of patients.","['Jack, Andrew']",['Jack A'],"['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Department of Haematology, Leeds Teaching Hospital, NHS Trust, United Kingdom. andrew.jack@leedsth.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis', '*Hematology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Laboratories, Hospital/*organization & administration', '*Pathology', 'United Kingdom']",79,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['J856RH7W05674764 [pii]', '10.1080/00313020500368360 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2005 Dec;37(6):479-92. doi: 10.1080/00313020500368360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rates of NHL have increased dramatically over the past few decades, although the rate of increase has recently slowed. It is now the sixth most common cancer in Australia. Globally, it is somewhat more common in men than in women, and rates are highest in North America and Australia. The causes of the increase in NHL rates are largely unknown. The best described risk factor for NHL is immune deficiency; rates of NHL are greatly increased, with relative risks of 10-100 or more, in people with immune deficiency associated with immune suppressive therapy after transplantation, HIV/AIDS, and congenital conditions. In addition, some NHL subtypes are associated with specific infections. These include immune-deficiency-associated central nervous system NHL (Epstein-Barr virus); gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue NHL (Helicobacter pylori); adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1) and body cavity-based lymphoma (human herpesvirus 8). However, these specific infections account for a very small proportion of total NHL incidence. In addition to immune deficiency and infection, other immune-related conditions are increasingly being recognised as related to NHL risk. Specific autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythema, Sjogren's syndrome, psoriasis and coeliac disease are associated with moderately increased risk of NHL. On the other hand, allergic and atopic conditions and their correlates such as early birth order, appear to be associated with a decreased risk of NHL.A variety of other exposures are less strongly related to NHL risk. These include occupational exposures, including some pesticides, herbicides, and solvents. Recently, two studies have reported that sun exposure is associated with a decreased risk of NHL. Smoking appears to be weakly positively associated with risk of follicular NHL, and alcohol intake is associated with a decreased risk of NHL. The pooled analysis of several case-control studies of NHL risk that are currently in the field promises to help clarify which of these risk factors are real, and will contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms of how disorders of the immune system, and other factors, are related to NHL risk.","['Grulich, Andrew E', 'Vajdic, Claire M']","['Grulich AE', 'Vajdic CM']","['HIV Epidemiology and Prevention Program, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of New South Wales, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia. agrulich@nchecr.unsw.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,"['Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors']",147,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['K2P13132721H0872 [pii]', '10.1080/00313020500370192 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2005 Dec;37(6):409-19. doi: 10.1080/00313020500370192.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allergens from peanut (Arachis hypogaea) are the most frequent cause of fatal food allergic reactions. The allergenic 2S albumin Ara h 2 and the homologous minor allergen Ara h 6 were studied at the molecular level with regard to allergenic potency of native and protease-treated allergen. A high-resolution solution structure of the protease-resistant core of Ara h 6 was determined by NMR spectroscopy, and homology modelling was applied to generate an Ara h 2 structure. Ara h 2 appeared to be the more potent allergen, even though the two peanut allergens share substantial cross-reactivity. Both allergens contain cores that are highly resistant to proteolytic digestion and to temperatures of up to 100 degrees C. Even though IgE antibody-binding capacity was reduced by protease treatment, the mediator release from a functional equivalent of a mast cell or basophil, the humanized RBL (rat basophilic leukaemia) cell, demonstrated that this reduction in IgE antibody-binding capacity does not necessarily translate into reduced allergenic potency. Native Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 have virtually identical allergenic potency as compared with the allergens that were treated with digestive enzymes. The folds of the allergenic cores are virtually identical with each other and with the fold of the corresponding regions in the undigested proteins. The extreme immunological stability of the core structures of Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 provides an explanation for the persistence of the allergenic potency even after food processing.","['Lehmann, Katrin', 'Schweimer, Kristian', 'Reese, Gerald', 'Randow, Stefanie', 'Suhr, Martin', 'Becker, Wolf-Meinhard', 'Vieths, Stefan', 'Rosch, Paul']","['Lehmann K', 'Schweimer K', 'Reese G', 'Randow S', 'Suhr M', 'Becker WM', 'Vieths S', 'Rosch P']","['Lehrstuhl Biopolymere, Universitat Bayreuth, 95440 Bayreuth, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['2S Albumins, Plant', 'Allergens/*chemistry/classification/*immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Arachis/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cross Reactions', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/*immunology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Plant Proteins/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Temperature']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20051728 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20051728 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2006 May 1;395(3):463-72. doi: 10.1042/BJ20051728.,,"['0 (2S Albumins, Plant)', '0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Ara h 2 allergen, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (Ara h 6 allergen, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,PMC1462689,,,,,,['PDB/1W2Q'],,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Case report and review of the literature (MEDLINE, 1962-2005). METHODS: A 34-year-old female patient with acute myeloid leukemia on remission admitted because of sudden hearing loss in her right ear for 10 days. She had experienced occasional tinnitus, ear fullness, and dizziness for a couple of months. After confirmation of her audiometric findings with auditory brainstem responses, the patient was put on a treatment regimen for sudden hearing loss. RESULTS: On the second day of treatment, she developed ipsilateral facial paralysis, hoarseness caused by ipsilateral vocal fold paralysis, and nystagmus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cranium revealed findings consistent with granulocytic sarcoma at the cerebellopontine angle, infiltrating the internal acoustic canal. As increased intracranial pressure symptoms developed subsequently, subtotal tumor resection was performed. However, the patient was lost, with Cushing's triad at the second postoperative month during postoperative chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Although up to 40% of leukemic patients may have otologic symptoms, sudden onset of sensorineural hearing loss is very rare. The patient presented in this report is the first reported case with a granulocytic sarcoma of the cerebellopontine angle who presented with acute sensorineural hearing loss. Despite the rarity of such a case, we would like to emphasize that leukemia must be kept in mind as an etiologic factor in sensorineural hearing loss and suggest that complete blood count and temporal bone imaging be routinely obtained.","['Gokcan, M Kursat', 'Batikhan, Hunkar', 'Calguner, Mustafa', 'Tataragasi, Ahmet I']","['Gokcan MK', 'Batikhan H', 'Calguner M', 'Tataragasi AI']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Ankara University Medical School, Ibn-I Sina Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. gokcan@dialup.ankara.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Otol Neurotol,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",100961504,IM,"['Adult', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*complications/*diagnosis/surgery', '*Cerebellopontine Angle/pathology/surgery', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem/physiology', 'Facial Paralysis/etiology', 'Female', 'Hearing Loss, Sudden/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vocal Cord Paralysis/etiology']",15,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['00129492-200601000-00019 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mao.0000194813.69556.3d [doi]']",ppublish,Otol Neurotol. 2006 Jan;27(1):106-9. doi: 10.1097/01.mao.0000194813.69556.3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms by which gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 induce hematopoietic malignancies are not fully understood. Our previous studies have shown that SHP-2 plays an essential role in IL-3 signal transduction in both catalytic-dependent and -independent manners and that overexpression (5-6-fold) of wild type (WT) SHP-2 attenuates IL-3-mediated hematopoietic cell function through accelerated dephosphorylation of STAT5. These results raised the possibility that SHP-2-associated leukemias are not solely attributed to the increased catalytic activity of GOF mutant SHP-2. GOF mutant SHP-2 must have gained additional capacities. To test this possibility, we investigated effects of a GOF mutation of SHP-2 (SHP-2 E76K) on hematopoietic cell function and IL-3 signal transduction by comparing with those of overexpressed WT SHP-2. Our results showed that SHP-2 E76K mutation caused myeloproliferative disease in mice, while overexpression of WT SHP-2 decreased hematopoietic potential of the transduced cells in recipient animals. The E76K mutation in the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain increased interactions of mutant SHP-2 with Grb2, Gab2, and p85, leading to hyperactivation of IL-3-induced Erk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. In addition, despite the substantial increase in the catalytic activity, dephosphorylation of STAT5 by SHP-2 E76K was dampened. Furthermore, catalytically inactive SHP-2 E76K with an additional C459S mutation retained the capability to increase the interaction with Gab2 and to enhance the activation of the PI3K pathway. Taken together, these studies suggest that in addition to the elevated catalytic activity, fundamental changes in physical and functional interactions between GOF mutant SHP-2 and signaling partners also play an important role in SHP-2-related leukemigenesis.","['Yu, Wen-Mei', 'Daino, Hanako', 'Chen, Jing', 'Bunting, Kevin D', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Yu WM', 'Daino H', 'Chen J', 'Bunting KD', 'Qu CK']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/*metabolism', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', '*Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)76664-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M507622200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Mar 3;281(9):5426-34. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M507622200.

Two of these triggering receptors, the NKp46 natural cytotoxicity receptor (NKp46) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-interactive NKG2D receptor, are deficiently expressed by NK cells recovered from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but little is known regarding the regulation of NKp46 and NKG2D expression. Here we report that mononuclear and polymorphonuclear phagocytes downregulate the cell surface density of NKp46 and NKG2D on NK cells with CD56(dim) phenotype in vitro by a mechanism that is dependent on the availability of phagocyte-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Histamine maintained NKp46 and NKG2D expression despite the presence of inhibitory phagocytes by targeting an H2 receptor on phagocytes. By contrast, NKp46 and NKG2D expression by the CD56(bright) subset of NK cells was resistant to inhibition by phagocytes. Our findings are suggestive of a novel mechanism of relevance to the regulation of NKp46/NKG2D receptor expression. Moreover, our findings suggest that the previously reported action of histamine on NK cell-mediated killing of leukaemic cells may be related to the preservation of activatory NK-cell receptors.","['Romero, Ana I', 'Thoren, Fredrik B', 'Brune, Mats', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer']","['Romero AI', 'Thoren FB', 'Brune M', 'Hellstrand K']","['Department of Virology, Goteborg University, Gothenburg, Sweden. ana.romero@microbio.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histamine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1', 'Neutrophil Activation/immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Phagocytes/immunology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5842 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05842.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Jan;132(1):91-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05842.x.,,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the allogeneic antigen-specific CD4+ CTL lines, CTL-A, generated from a patient with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, recognised HLA-DPB1*0501-positive Epstein-Barr virus-immortalised human B cell line (EBV-B cells), phytohaemagglutinin blasts and leukaemia cells, but not interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treated HLA-DPB1*0501-positive fibroblasts, indicating that this CD4+ T-cell line recognised a minor histocompatibility antigen (mHa) that is preferentially expressed in haematopoietic cells in an HLA-DPB1*0501-restricted manner. The other CD4+ CTL line, CTL-B, generated from a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia, recognised mismatched HLA-DQB1*0303 on EBV-B cells and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) blasts. Interestingly, this CTL line did not recognise IFN-gamma-treated recipient's skin fibroblasts, as HLA-DQ was merely upregulated even after IFN-gamma stimulation in non-haematopoietic cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and hepatocytes. These results suggest that these CD4 positive CTLs, specific for mismatch HLA-DQ and mHa that are preferentially expressed on haematopoietic cells, may play an important role in induction of selective graft-versus-leukaemia effect without development of graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic HSCT.","['Matsushita, Maiko', 'Yamazaki, Rie', 'Ikeda, Hideyuki', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Sumimoto, Hidetoshi', 'Fujita, Tomonobu', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kawakami, Yutaka']","['Matsushita M', 'Yamazaki R', 'Ikeda H', 'Mori T', 'Sumimoto H', 'Fujita T', 'Okamoto S', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kawakami Y']","['Division of Cellular Signaling, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/analysis', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Male', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/12/24 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/12/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5843 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05843.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Jan;132(1):56-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05843.x.,,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At presentation, a neurologic exam revealed normal pelvic limb flexor reflexes, the absence of an anal reflex, and deep pain recognition. Radiographs did not identify any obvious spinal abnormality or osseous trauma, although the liver and spleen were prominent. Hematologic analysis disclosed leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. At necropsy, red, friable to gelatinous masses were found associated with the ventral aspect of the vertebral column at the levels of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Impression smears of the mass revealed a monocytic cell population with cells averaging 7 to 10 microm in diameter and having scant cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei, characteristics consistent with a lymphoid neoplasm. Histologically, the neoplasm was unencapsulated, poorly demarcated and highly infiltrative, invading and effacing the bone marrow and epidural space of the vertebral column. Neoplastic cells also were identified in the femoral bone marrow, spleen, liver, iliac and sacral lymph nodes, and lung. Immunophenotyping showed the neoplasm to be of T-cell origin. Although the lymphoma did not invade the meninges of the spinal cord, its impingement on the central and peripheral nervous systems resulted in foci of Wallerian degeneration that contributed to the paraplegia.

We report a case of a woman with M4 AML who experienced IEMR post-autoBMT and review the related literature. Seventy-two alloBMT and 3 autoBMT patients, including ours, were identified. The review suggests that an M2 or M4 French-American-British (FAB) phenotype, intermediate cytogenetic risk group, and chromosome 8 abnormalities are more frequently associated with the occurrence of IEMR. IEMR occurs earlier in autoBMT than in alloBMT. Combined treatment with radiation and high-dose chemotherapy may be effective. When we searched the European Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (EBMTR) database, we found the incidence of IEMR to be statistically greater in alloBMT than in autoBMT (11% vs. 6%; P = 0.02), but no correlations have been found with the conditioning transplant regimen used. A closer follow-up, including body and central nervous system scan, should be considered in patients who are undergoing BMT presenting with several IEMR-associated factors.","['Potenza, Leonardo', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Riva, Giovanni', 'Morselli, Monica', 'Ferrari, Angela', 'Imovilli, Annalisa', 'Giacobbi, Francesca', 'Temperani, Paola', 'Donelli, Amedea', 'Narni, Franco', 'Torelli, Giuseppe']","['Potenza L', 'Luppi M', 'Riva G', 'Morselli M', 'Ferrari A', 'Imovilli A', 'Giacobbi F', 'Temperani P', 'Donelli A', 'Narni F', 'Torelli G']","['Section of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Central Nervous System/diagnostic imaging', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Radiography', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20421 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2006 Jan;81(1):45-50. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20421.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Growth impairment after cranial radiation (CR) can result in diminished adult height, but growth failure following chemotherapy without CR is usually followed by catch-up growth and normal adult height.1 A retrospective review of 347 ALL survivors registered in our Long Term Follow Up (LTFU) Clinic, since 1997 revealed that 109 had received CR; 3, total body irradiation (TBI); and 235, neither CR nor TBI. For patients whose growth velocity slowed, growth hormone (GH) levels and pediatric endocrinology referrals were obtained. Among the 112 ALL survivors who had received some form of CR, 5 had significant growth failure with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Among the 235 ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy without CR, 2 were diagnosed with growth failure and GHD. We report the two survivors of childhood ALL treated with chemotherapy without CR who required GH replacement due to absence of catch-up growth. A 15-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, off therapy for 9 and 6 years, respectively, were evaluated for decreased growth velocity and failure of catch-up growth. Peak GH responses to stimulation using arginine and clonidine were 3.4 and 3.0 ng/ml, respectively (normal >10 ng/ml). Other causes of growth failure were ruled out, and GH replacement therapy was instituted. Their chemotherapy had included methotrexate, 6 mercaptopurine, vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, L-asparaginase, dexamethasone, cytarabine, 6 thioguanine, and intrathecal methotrexate. The growth of all children treated with intensive chemotherapy, regardless of whether CR was administered, should be closely monitored with measurement of standing height at 6 months intervals until growth is complete.","['Haddy, Theresa B', 'Mosher, Revonda B', 'Nunez, Susan B', 'Reaman, Gregory H']","['Haddy TB', 'Mosher RB', 'Nunez SB', 'Reaman GH']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.

Therefore, we examined the effects of anti-PTHrP antibody and osteoprotegerin (OPG) on PTHrP-producing tumor-induced cachexia. Nude mice bearing PTHrP-producing human lung cancer cells (HARA-B) exhibited cachexia with hypercalcemia 3-4 weeks after inoculation, accompanied by losses in body, adipose tissue, and muscle weight. OPG ameliorated hypercalcemia, as did neutralization of PTHrP with antibody; and it increased both body and adipose tissue weights. These increases in body and adipose tissue weight, however, were significantly less than those in mice treated with anti-PTHrP antibody. Simultaneous administration of OPG and anti-PTHrP antibody caused significant increases in body, adipose tissue, and muscle weight, along with an immediate decrease in blood ionized calcium levels. The increase in body weight was similar to that observed in mice treated with anti-PTHrP antibody alone, and the decrease in the blood ionized calcium levels was significantly greater than that in mice treated with OPG or anti-PTHrP antibody alone. These results suggest that an effect of PTHrP on target tissues other than hypercalcemia is involved in the development of cachexia. Expression of cachexia-inducing proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor) is stimulated by PTHrP. This might be a mechanism by which PTHrP produces tumor-induced cachexia. It is also suggested that OPG and anti-PTHrP antibody synergistically act to ameliorate hypercalcemia, although the mechanism responsible for this is unclear.","['Iguchi, Haruo', 'Aramaki, Yuko', 'Maruta, Shigeaki', 'Takiguchi, Soichi']","['Iguchi H', 'Aramaki Y', 'Maruta S', 'Takiguchi S']","['Division of Tumor Dynamics, National Kyushu Cancer Center, 3-1-1 Notame, Minami-ku, Fukuoka 811-1395, Japan. higuchi@nk-cc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Bone Miner Metab,Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,9436705,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cachexia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glycoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Osteoprotegerin', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00774-005-0640-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Metab. 2006;24(1):16-9. doi: 10.1007/s00774-005-0640-5.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF11B protein, human)', '0 (Tnfrsf11b protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the occurrence of such atypical MTX neurotoxicity in children and document its MR presentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical findings and brain MRI obtained in 90 children treated with MTX for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or non-B malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. All 90 patients had normal brain imaging before treatment. In these patients, brain imaging was performed after treatment completion and/or relapse and/or occurrence of neurological symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients, 15 (16.7%) showed signs of MTX neurotoxicity on brain MRI, 9 (10%) were asymptomatic, and 6 (6.7%) showed signs of acute leukoencephalopathy. On the routine brain MRI performed at the end of treatment, all asymptomatic patients had classical MR findings of reversible MTX neurotoxicity, such as abnormal high-intensity areas localized in the deep periventricular white matter on T2-weighted images. In contrast, the six symptomatic patients had atypical brain MRI characterized by T2 high-intensity areas in the supratentorial cortex and subcortical white matter (n=6), cerebellar cortex and white matter (n=4), deep periventricular white matter (n=2) and thalamus (n=1). MR normalization occurred later than clinical recovery in these six patients. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to mostly asymptomatic classical MTX neurotoxicity, MTX may induce severe but reversible unusual leukoencephalopathy. It is important to recognize this clinicoradiological presentation in the differential diagnosis of acute neurological deterioration in children treated with MTX.","['Ziereisen, France', 'Dan, Bernard', 'Azzi, Nadira', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Damry, Nash', 'Christophe, Catherine']","['Ziereisen F', 'Dan B', 'Azzi N', 'Ferster A', 'Damry N', 'Christophe C']","[""Department of Radiology, Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital, Avenue J J Crocq 15, 1020 Brussels, Belgium. france.ziereisen@huderf.be""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00247-005-0015-z [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2006 Mar;36(3):205-12. doi: 10.1007/s00247-005-0015-z.

The aim of this study was to examine the expression and function of LIF in the pancreas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the expression of LIF and its receptor components, LIF-receptor-beta and gp130, by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and RT-PCR in normal rat pancreas, pancreas with duct ligation-induced islet neogenesis, and in pancreatic cell cultures. Isolated duct fragments were cultured in the presence of LIF and a janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor. RESULTS: LIF was detected by immunohistochemistry, western blot and RT-PCR in the ducts of the normal pancreas. Both LIF-receptor-beta and gp130 were detected by RT-PCR in the pancreas. Immunostaining revealed gp130 exclusively in the ducts and centro-acinar cells. After duct ligation-induced tissue injury, upregulation of LIF and its receptor occurred in rat pancreas. Metaplastic exocrine cells also started to express LIF and this was increased after alloxan treatment. Signalling via LIF-receptor-beta/gp130 involves the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. LIF induced increased activation of STAT3 in pancreatic cells. In isolated duct fragments, addition of LIF resulted in a significant increase in duct cell proliferation, while a specific inhibitor of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway inhibited proliferation. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our observations show that LIF and its receptor are expressed in cells from pancreatic ducts. The cytokine plays a role in pancreatic physiology, controls duct cell proliferation and is involved in repair processes following pancreatic injury.","['De Breuck, S', 'Baeyens, L', 'Bouwens, L']","['De Breuck S', 'Baeyens L', 'Bouwens L']","['Cell Differentiation Unit, Vrije Universiteit Brussel Free University of Brussels, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,IM,"['Animals', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insulin/analysis', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Pancreas/*physiology', 'Pancreatic Ducts/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reference Values', 'Regeneration', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00125-005-0079-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2006 Jan;49(1):108-16. doi: 10.1007/s00125-005-0079-1.

Conventional biochemical approaches, e.g. immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and ELISA, have played a major role in elucidation of individual signaling events. However, these methods are laborious, time-consuming, and difficult to adapt for high throughput analysis. A multiplex approach to measure phosphorylation state of multiple signaling proteins simultaneously would significantly enhance the efficiency and scope of signaling pathway analysis for mechanistic studies and clinical application. This report describes a novel multiplex microbead suspension array approach to examine phosphoproteomic profiles in lymphoid cells. In the Jurkat T-cell leukemia line, the multiplex assay enabled targeted investigation of phosphorylation kinetics of signal transduction from receptor proximal events (tyrosine phosphoproteins CD3, Lck, Zap-70, and linker for T-cell activation) to cytosolic events (serine/threonine phosphoproteins Erk and Akt) to transcription factors (serine/threonine phosphorylated Rsk, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein, and STAT3). To broaden the application of the multiplex analysis, signaling pathways were also studied in B-cell lymphoid tumor lines that included chronic lymphocytic leukemia lines. In these cell lines, multiplex suspension array enabled phosphoproteomic analysis of signaling cascade mediated by Syk, a homolog of Zap-70. Results obtained by multiplex analysis were confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot methods. The examples of T-cell and B-cell signaling pathway analyses in this report demonstrate the utility of the multiplex suspension arrays to investigate phosphorylation dynamics and kinetics of several signaling proteins simultaneously in signal transduction pathways.","['Khan, Imran H', 'Mendoza, Sara', 'Rhyne, Paul', 'Ziman, Melanie', 'Tuscano, Joseph', 'Eisinger, Dominic', 'Kung, Hsing-Jien', 'Luciw, Paul A']","['Khan IH', 'Mendoza S', 'Rhyne P', 'Ziman M', 'Tuscano J', 'Eisinger D', 'Kung HJ', 'Luciw PA']","['Center for Comparative Medicine, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/06/22 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)30359-5 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.T500032-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2006 Apr;5(4):758-68. doi: 10.1074/mcp.T500032-MCP200.

Herein, we expand this finding by demonstrating constitutive and glucocorticoid-enhanced CD163 expression on French-American-British M4/M5 AML cells, and leukemic blasts of other AML subtypes and normal hematopoietic progenitor cells do not express CD163.

Together, our results identify CD163 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

CASE SUMMARY: A 13-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was treated for cytomegalovirus retinitis with valganciclovir 450 mg every 2 days in the course of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Concomitant medication included omeprazole, furosemide, and acetaminophen. During treatment, when creatinine clearance decreased to 20 mL/min, the child presented with acute neurotoxicity, consisting of mental confusion and hallucinations, which resolved when all medications were stopped. Valganciclovir therapeutic monitoring showed high ganciclovir concentrations in the plasma (3.85 microg/mL) and cerebrospinal fluid (2.6 microg/mL) 48 hours after the last valganciclovir dose. After recovery of neurologic function, valganciclovir was resumed at a lower dosage (225 mg twice a week) with therapeutic drug monitoring and was well tolerated. However, the cytomegalovirus infection was not resolved. The leukemia relapsed, and the patient had terminal renal failure and died. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between valganciclovir and neurotoxicity. DISCUSSION: Drugs taken by this child (acyclovir, valganciclovir, omeprazole) have been reported to induce neurotoxicity, with the pharmacokinetics of the first 2 being altered by renal failure. At the time when acyclovir was first administered, symptoms of neurotoxicity were already apparent. Moreover, plasma concentrations of ganciclovir were very high during the course of the neurotoxicity. Thus, the adverse effects seemed related to an overdosage of valganciclovir and were worsened by the addition of acyclovir. CONCLUSIONS: This case is informative because few clinical and pharmacokinetic data are available concerning the use of valganciclovir in children. A study should be performed to determine the proper pediatric dose of valganciclovir with and without renal impairment to prevent the occurrence of adverse effects.","['Peyriere, Helene', 'Jeziorsky, Eric', 'Jalabert, Anne', 'Cociglio, Marylene', 'Benketira, Abdelkader', 'Blayac, Jean-Pierre', 'Hansel, Sylvie', 'Margueritte, Genevieve', 'Hillaire-Buys, Dominique']","['Peyriere H', 'Jeziorsky E', 'Jalabert A', 'Cociglio M', 'Benketira A', 'Blayac JP', 'Hansel S', 'Margueritte G', 'Hillaire-Buys D']","['Department of Medical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Lapeyronie Hospital, Montpellier, France. h-peyriere@chu-montpellier.fr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antiviral Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Ganciclovir/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology', 'Kidney Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Valganciclovir']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/04/11 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['aph.1G214 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1G214 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2006 Jan;40(1):143-6. doi: 10.1345/aph.1G214.

Here, we describe the multiple mechanisms of RFC inactivation in human leukemia PT523-resistant cells originally harboring 3 RFC alleles. Cellular exposure to gradually increasing PT523 concentrations resulted in sublines displaying up to 3500-fold resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates that rely on RFC for their cellular uptake. Antifolate-resistant cells lost RFC gene expression (65%-99% loss) due to impaired promoter binding of various transcription factors that regulate RFC gene expression. Additionally, DNA sequencing revealed that PT523-resistant cells contained a cluster of 4 nearly consecutive mutations residing on a single RFC allele including L143P, A147V, R148G, and Q150Stop. Southern blot analysis established the loss of an RFC allele in PT523-resistant cells. These alterations resulted in markedly decreased RFC protein levels (approximately 80%-99% loss) and consequently impaired [3H]methotrexate transport (87%-99% loss). This study provides the first evidence that acquisition of PT523 resistance in human leukemia cells harboring 3 RFC alleles is due to multiple coexisting alterations including transcriptional silencing, inactivating mutations, and RFC allele loss.","['Kaufman, Yotam', 'Ifergan, Ilan', 'Rothem, Lilah', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Kaufman Y', 'Ifergan I', 'Rothem L', 'Jansen G', 'Assaraf YG']","['Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Alleles', 'Biological Transport/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pterins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Response Elements/drug effects/genetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65763-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-10-4048 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Apr 15;107(8):3288-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-10-4048.

METHODS: Using the database from the Japan National Hospital Lung Cancer Study Group between 1985 and 1995, information was obtained on 62 patients who were more than 3 years disease-free survivors. Details of clinical information and most smoking history were available from the questionnaire. RESULTS: Nine of the 62 patients developed SPC 3.9-12.2 years (median, 6.2 years) after the initiation of the treatment. The site of SPC was 2 lung, 1 esophagus, 2 stomach, 1 colon, 1 breast, 1 skin and 1 leukemia. Among these nine, three cancers occurred inside the radiation field. The relative risk of any SPC was 2.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-5.3]. The risk changed with the passage of time and it increased significantly (5.2 times at or beyond 7 years) after the treatment. In univariate analysis, the patients who were male, had more cumulative smoking and continued smoking, had an increased risk of SPC [relative risk (RR) 2.7, CI 1.1-5.3; RR 3.0, CI 1.2-6.2; RR 5.2, CI 1.6-11.7, respectively]. In multivariate analysis, factors including smoking status and histological type had no effect on the development of a SPC. CONCLUSION: The patients with stage III NSCLC successfully treated with chemo-radiotherapy were at risk for developing SPC and this risk increased with time.","['Kawaguchi, Tomoya', 'Matsumura, Akihide', 'Iuchi, Keiji', 'Ishikawa, Seiji', 'Maeda, Hajime', 'Fukai, Shimao', 'Komatsu, Hikotaro', 'Kawahara, Masaaki']","['Kawaguchi T', 'Matsumura A', 'Iuchi K', 'Ishikawa S', 'Maeda H', 'Fukai S', 'Komatsu H', 'Kawahara M']",['National Hospital Study Group for Lung Cancer in Japan. t-kawaguchi@kch.hosp.go.jp'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk', 'Smoking/*adverse effects']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/03/25 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['hyi208 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyi208 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan;36(1):7-11. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyi208.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1574 rats inhaled radon/radon decay products in a purpose-built recirculating exposure system that provided stable/reproducible exposure conditions. 501 were maintained as controls. RESULTS: Lung tumour incidences were significantly elevated in most exposed groups. The study power was insufficient to resolve the shape of the dose and dose rate response curves, but combination of this data with that from other studies demonstrated that for high cumulative exposures, the lifetime excess absolute risk increases with increasing exposure durations and for low cumulative exposures the opposite trend occurs. Exposure did not increase leukaemia incidences. A small number of non-lung tumour types including mammary fibroadenoma showed elevated incidences in some exposed groups, however not consistently across all exposure groups and showed no dose or dose rate relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Radon/radon decay product exposure caused excess lung tumours in rats along with limited non-lung effects. The results are consistent with the findings that at low cumulative exposures decreasing exposure concentrations or protracting the time over which the dose is delivered, reduces lung tumour risk. At higher levels, decreasing exposure concentrations or protracting exposure time increases lung tumour risk.","['Collier, C G', 'Strong, J C', 'Humphreys, J A', 'Timpson, N', 'Baker, S T', 'Eldred, T', 'Cobb, L', 'Papworth, D', 'Haylock, R']","['Collier CG', 'Strong JC', 'Humphreys JA', 'Timpson N', 'Baker ST', 'Eldred T', 'Cobb L', 'Papworth D', 'Haylock R']","['Biomedical Research, Harwell, Oxon, UK.

Relatively little information is available regarding the relation of known topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage with other intracellular pathways. To gain an insight into the intracellular molecular mechanisms of Topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin-mediated DNA damage leading to cell death, we used a high-density cDNA microarray to assess sensitive early gene expression profiles in SGC7901 (gastric cancer), Hela (cervical adenocarcinoma), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia) tumor cells stimulated with camptothecin for 1 h at the concentrations of GI50 (50 % growth inhibition after 24 h of treatment). Analysis of the differentially expressed genes obtained 29 response genes common to all four cell lines. Moreover, these cell lines also shared the direction of regulation. Most of these common response genes were functionally related to cell proliferation or apoptosis, and some of them were involved in ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM-and Rad3 related) checkpoint pathways, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway, the survival phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 kinase-Akt-dependent pathway, mitochondrial cell death pathway, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related cell death pathway, and to ubiquitin/proteasome dependent protein degradation pathway.

We studied the effects of galectin-8 (Gal-8), a beta-galactoside binding lectin, on Jurkat T cells. Immobilized Gal-8 bound alpha1beta1, alpha3beta1 and alpha5beta1 but not alpha2beta1 and alpha4beta1 and adhered these cells with similar kinetics to immobilized fibronectin (FN). Function-blocking experiments with monoclonal anti-integrin antibodies suggested that alpha5beta1 is the main mediator of cell adhesion to this lectin. Gal-8, but not FN, induced extensive cell spreading frequently leading to a polarized phenotype characterized by an asymmetric lamellipodial protrusion. These morphological changes involved actin cytoskeletal rearrangements controlled by PI3K, Rac-1 and ERK1/2 activity. Gal-8-induced Rac-1 activation and binding to alpha1 and alpha5 integrins have not been described in any other cellular system. Strikingly, Gal-8 was also a strong stimulus on Jurkat cells in suspension, triggering ERK1/2 activation that in most adherent cells is instead dependent on cell attachment. In addition, we found that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a prototypic autoimmune disorder, produce Gal-8 autoantibodies that impede both its binding to integrins and cell adhesion. These are the first function-blocking autoantibodies reported for a member of the galectin family. These results indicate that Gal-8 constitutes a novel extracellular stimulus for T cells, able to bind specific beta1 integrins and to trigger signaling pathways conducive to cell spreading. Gal-8 could modulate a wide range of T cell-driven immune processes that eventually become altered in autoimmune disorders.","['Carcamo, Claudia', 'Pardo, Evelyn', 'Oyanadel, Claudia', 'Bravo-Zehnder, Marcela', 'Bull, Paulina', 'Caceres, Monica', 'Martinez, Jorge', 'Massardo, Loreto', 'Jacobelli, Sergio', 'Gonzalez, Alfonso', 'Soza, Andrea']","['Carcamo C', 'Pardo E', 'Oyanadel C', 'Bravo-Zehnder M', 'Bull P', 'Caceres M', 'Martinez J', 'Massardo L', 'Jacobelli S', 'Gonzalez A', 'Soza A']","['Departamento de Inmunologia Clinica y Reumatologia, Facultad de Medicina, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Autoantibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Surface Extensions/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Galectins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Thiogalactosides/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Wortmannin', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(05)00510-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2006 Feb 15;312(4):374-86. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.025.,,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (LGALS8 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '0 (Thiogalactosides)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '80441-61-8 (thiodigalactoside)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is frequently hampered by the decrease of proliferative potential and functional activity of T cell clones used for screening procedures. Transfer of the genes encoding the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains of leukaemia-specific clones into primary T cells may help to circumvent this obstacle. In this study, transfer of two minor histocompatibility antigen (minor H antigen)-specific TCRs was performed and the feasibility of the use of TCR-transgenic T cells for identification of minor H antigens through cDNA library screening was investigated. We found that TCR-transgenic cells acquired the specificity of the original clones and matched their sensitivity. Moreover, the higher scale of cytokine-production by TCR-transgenic T cells permits the detection of either small amounts of antigen-positive cells or cells expressing low amounts of an antigen. When applied in equal numbers, TCR-transgenic T cells and the original T cell clones produced similar results in the screening of a cDNA library. However, the use of increased numbers of TCR-transgenic T cells allowed detection of minute amounts of antigen, barely discernible by the T cell clone. In conclusion, TCR-transfer generates a large amount of functional antigen-specific cells suitable for screening of cDNA expression libraries for identification of cognate antigens.","['Ivanov, R', 'Hol, S', 'Aarts, T I', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Ebeling, S B']","['Ivanov R', 'Hol S', 'Aarts TI', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Ebeling SB']","['Jordan Laboratory for Hemato-Oncology, Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokines/immunology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'Transgenes']",,2005/12/22 09:00,2006/02/07 09:00,['2005/12/22 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEI2967 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02967.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2006 Jan;143(1):78-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02967.x.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,PMC1809573,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extract Koloquinthentrockenextrakt Alpha with the highest content of Cucurbitacins (23,2 % delta 232,64 mg/g) permitted the definition of the LD50 for female (tentative because of death inhibition under maximal doses) and male rats; the mean LD50 = 281,8 and 525,6 mg/kg extract, respectively, equivalent to 66 and 122 mg/kg Cucurbitacins. This corresponds to 660- to 1220-fold therapeutic doses. Repeated administrations of 10- and 50-fold therapeutic doses to rats for 30 days produced no negative effects. The symptoms of rodent poisoning are described in detail. Pharmacologic doses were not toxic on rat liver slices, did not influence breathing and circulation parameters in guinea pigs (under the maximal dose of 41,6 mg/kg Cucurbitacins, 3/10 animals died of breathing failure) nor the behaviour of mice, nor were they mutagen (Ames test).

The Cucurbitacins E and I were rapidly metabolized in S9-supernatants of rat livers. A dried ethanolic Salvia fruit extract alleviated the toxicity of lethal doses of Colocynth pulp extract when administered simultaneously.

Clinical laboratory investigations of volunteers gave no indication of pathological changes even under the highest dose. In patients with obstipation and associated complaints, the administration for 3 days at maximum led to an increased frequency of bowel movements.

We now show that Stx2 causedTHP-1 cells to release the chemokines IL-8, MDC, and RANTES and that the presence of LPS further stimulated this release. IL-8 was produced in greatest amount and was an effective co-agonist for inducing platelet aggregation. Primary human monocytes also released large amounts of IL-8 in response to LPS and Stx2. Factors released byTHP-1 cells exposed to Stx2 and LPS activated platelet function as evidenced by increased aggregation, serotonin secretion, P-selectin exposure and by the formation of stable platelet-monocyte aggregates.

Previous reports indicated that administration of the g209-2M peptide could induce g209-reactive circulating T cells in patients with melanoma and that the combination of g209-2M and high-dose IL-2 might be a more active treatment than high-dose IL-2 alone. Low-dose IL-2 is not active but has significant biologic effects, and because of a different toxicity profile, it can be offered to most patients. The primary objective of this cooperative group phase 2 study was to determine the activity of the combination of g209-2M and low-dose IL-2 in advanced melanoma. Twenty-six HLA appropriate patients with advanced melanoma received subcutaneous g209-2M peptide once every 3 weeks and subcutaneous IL-2 (5 million IU/m) daily for 5 days during the first and second weeks. Patients were monitored for tumor response, toxicity, and induction of g209-reactive circulating T cells. There were no objective responses. There were no toxic deaths and no grade 4 toxicities. More than half of the patients experienced some grade 2 toxicity and one quarter experienced grade 3 toxicity. There was no convincing evidence by enzyme-linked immunospot or tetramer analysis of induction of g209-reactive circulating T cells.

The defective proliferative response to tumor cells in vitro can partly be overcome by concomitant CD28 costimulatory signaling. We investigated whether T-cell activation via chimeric receptors (chRec) can be further improved by ligand expression on antigen-presenting cells of B-cell origin. We generated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) expressing a CD19-specific chRec. These CTLs are provided with native receptor stimulation by autologous EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) but exclusively with chRec (CD19-specific) stimulation by allogeneic, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched CD19+ LCLs. CD19zeta-transduced EBV-specific CTLs specifically lysed both allogeneic EBV targets and CD19+ tumor cells through the chRec in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner, while maintaining their ability to recognize autologous EBV targets through the native T-cell receptor. The transduced CTLs failed to proliferate in response to CD19+ tumor targets even in the presence of CD28 costimulatory signaling. By contrast, CD19 expressed on HLA-mismatched LCL-induced T-cell activation and long-term proliferation that essentially duplicated the result from native receptor stimulation with autologous LCLs, suggesting that a deficit of costimulatory molecules on target cells in addition to CD28 is indeed responsible for inadequate chRec-mediated T-cell function. Hence, effective tumor immunotherapy may be favored if engagement of the chRec on modified T cells is complemented by interaction with multiple costimulator molecules. The use of T cells with native specificity for EBV may be one means of attaining this objective.","['Rossig, Claudia', 'Bar, Annette', 'Pscherer, Sibylle', 'Altvater, Bianca', 'Pule, Martin', 'Rooney, Cliona M', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Jurgens, Heribert', 'Vormoor, Josef']","['Rossig C', 'Bar A', 'Pscherer S', 'Altvater B', 'Pule M', 'Rooney CM', 'Brenner MK', 'Jurgens H', 'Vormoor J']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany. rossig@uni-muenster.de""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Genetic Engineering/methods', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/virology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/02/02 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['00002371-200601000-00003 [pii]', '10.1097/01.cji.0000175492.28723.d6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2006 Jan-Feb;29(1):21-31. doi: 10.1097/01.cji.0000175492.28723.d6.,['P01 CA094237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These symptoms correlated with the neuropathological spread and intensity, which were more severe in the spinal cord of rats infected with PVC211 than in those infected with A8-V, without exhibiting neuropathological differences in other areas of the CNS. Interestingly, virus titers recovered from infected spinal cords were similar in PVC211 and A8-V infected animals. However, in the spinal cord infected with PVC211, glial cells attained higher immunohistochemical expression scores for the viral surface antigen, gp70 (Env) than in the A8-V infected spinal cord, although expression levels of viral antigens in blood vessel walls were similar in A8-V and PVC211 infections. Furthermore, many of those glial cells which carried viral antigens were found, by double immunostaining, to be microglia.

These results suggest that provirus insertion into particular positions of the host genome is correlated with tumorigenesis after A8 infection and that up-regulation of c-myc plays an important role in the induction of thymoma.,"['Hirano, Tomoko', 'Watanabe, Rihito', 'Takase-Yoden, Sayaka']","['Hirano T', 'Watanabe R', 'Takase-Yoden S']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Faculty of Engineering, Soka University, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymoma/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Integration']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/mandi/49.1069 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1348-0421.2005.tb03704.x [doi]']",ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2005;49(12):1069-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2005.tb03704.x.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-tryptophan depletion and NO production are both known to have an antimicrobial effect in macrophages, and the interaction of these two mechanisms is unclear. In this study we found that IDO activity was inhibited by the peroxynitrite generator, 3-(4-morpholinyl)sydnonimine, in PMA-differentiated cytokine-induced THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia) cells and IFN-gamma-stimulated PBMCs, whereas IDO protein expression was unaffected compared with that in untreated cells. Nitrotyrosine was detected in immunoprecipitated (IP)-IDO from PMA-differentiated cytokine-induced THP-1 cells treated with 3-(4-morpholinyl)sydnonimine, but not from untreated cells. Treatment of IP-IDO and recombinant IDO (rIDO) with peroxynitrite significantly decreased enzyme activity. Nitrotyrosine was detected in both peroxynitrite-treated IP-IDO and rIDO, but not in either untreated IP-IDO or rIDO. Peptide analysis by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated that Tyr15, Tyr345, and Tyr353 in rIDO were nitrated by peroxynitrite. The levels of Tyr nitration and the inhibitory effect of peroxynitrite on IDO activity were significantly reduced in the Tyr15-to-Phe mutant. These results indicate that IDO is nitrated and inactivated by peroxynitrite and that nitration of Tyr15 in IDO protein is the most important factor in the inactivation of IDO.","['Fujigaki, Hidetsugu', 'Saito, Kuniaki', 'Lin, Felix', 'Fujigaki, Suwako', 'Takahashi, Kanako', 'Martin, Brian M', 'Chen, Cai Y', 'Masuda, Junichi', 'Kowalak, Jeffrey', 'Takikawa, Osamu', 'Seishima, Mitsuru', 'Markey, Sanford P']","['Fujigaki H', 'Saito K', 'Lin F', 'Fujigaki S', 'Takahashi K', 'Martin BM', 'Chen CY', 'Masuda J', 'Kowalak J', 'Takikawa O', 'Seishima M', 'Markey SP']","['Department of Informative Clinical Medicine, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu City, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/chemistry/*drug effects/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peroxynitrous Acid/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/chemistry/drug effects']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/1/372 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.1.372 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jan 1;176(1):372-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.1.372.,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '14691-52-2 (Peroxynitrous Acid)', '3604-79-3 (3-nitrotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus encodes a Tax oncoprotein that functions in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and transformation. Because adult T cell leukemia like many other human cancers is a disease of genomic instability with frequent gains and losses of chromosomes, to understand this disease it is important to comprehend how HTLV-1 engenders aneuploidy in host cells. In this regard, loss of cell cycle checkpoints permits tolerance of aneuploidy but does not explain how aneuploidy is created. We show here that HTLV-1 Tax causes abnormal centrosome fragmentation in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle.

We do not understand the basis for the specificity of the JAK2V617F mutation in clonal disorders of the myeloid, but not lymphoid, lineage, nor has the basis for the pleiotropic phenotype of JAK2V617F-associated myeloproliferative disorders been delineated. However, the presence of the identical mutation in patients with related, but clinicopathologically distinct, myeloid disorders suggests that interactions between the JAK2V617F kinase and other signaling molecules may influence the phenotype of hematopoietic progenitors expressing JAK2V617F. Here, we show that coexpression of the JAK2V617F mutant kinase with a homodimeric Type I cytokine receptor, the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), the thrombopoietin receptor, or the granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor receptor, is necessary for transformation of hematopoietic cells to growth-factor independence and for hormone-independent activation of JAK-STAT signaling. Furthermore, EpoR mutations that impair erythropoietin-mediated JAK2 or STAT5 activation also impair transformation mediated by the JAK2V617F kinase, indicating that JAK2V617F requires a cytokine receptor scaffold for its transforming and signaling activities. Our results reveal the molecular basis for the prevalence of JAK2V617F in diseases of myeloid lineage cells that express these Type I cytokine receptors but not in lymphoid lineage cells that do not.","['Lu, Xiaohui', 'Levine, Ross', 'Tong, Wei', 'Wernig, Gerlinde', 'Pikman, Yana', 'Zarnegar, Sara', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Lodish, Harvey']","['Lu X', 'Levine R', 'Tong W', 'Wernig G', 'Pikman Y', 'Zarnegar S', 'Gilliland DG', 'Lodish H']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/02/07 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['0509714102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0509714102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Dec 27;102(52):18962-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0509714102.

We investigated whether the disparity in survival would persist when patients were treated with similar therapies (ie, phase II/III Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] trials). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed 995 patients (928 non-African American and 67 African American) receiving chemotherapy in CALGB studies for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Clinical and demographic characteristics, treatment received, and survival data were obtained from the CALGB database. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of race/ethnicity on survival after adjustment for other known prognostic factors. All statistical tests were two sided. RESULTS: The unadjusted survival distribution of African American patients was not significantly different from that of non-African American patients; median survival was 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.4 to 13.4 months) for African American patients versus 9.9 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 10.3 months) for non-African American patients. Multivariable adjustment for the effect of treatment arm, histology, and metastatic site at presentation did not alter the outcome for African American patients. Survival was similar even though African American patients were more likely to have a poorer performance status, present with significant weight loss, and be Medicaid recipients (20% v 6%), which is an indicator of lower socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: African American patients tended to present with prognostic features associated with a worse survival. However, when offered equivalent therapy, the outcome for African American patients was the same as that observed for non-African American patients.","['Blackstock, A William', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Paskett, Electra D', 'Miller, Antonius A', 'Lathan, Christopher', 'Niell, Harvey B', 'Socinski, Mark A', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Green, Mark R']","['Blackstock AW', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Paskett ED', 'Miller AA', 'Lathan C', 'Niell HB', 'Socinski MA', 'Vokes EE', 'Green MR']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA. ablackst@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/ethnology/*mortality/pathology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/ethnology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.02.1436 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.1436 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 20;24(3):407-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.1436.

DNA synthesis and methylation, which are closely linked to folate metabolism and transport, may be affected by polymorphisms in genes involved in these pathways. Folate metabolism polymorphisms have been linked to acute lymphoblastic leukemia and colorectal cancer. To evaluate whether genetic variation in folate metabolism and transport may have a role in determining the risk of developing NHL, we analyzed several polymorphisms using DNA obtained as part of a large U.K. population-based case-control study of lymphoma. Polymorphisms studied include methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C >T and 1298 A >C, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756 A>G, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1) 1420 C >T, thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 1494del6 and 28-bp repeat, and reduced folate carrier (RFC) 80 G >A.

We observed no association between NHL and haplotypes for MTHFR or TYMS. These findings are somewhat inconsistent with those of others, but may reflect differences in circulating folate levels between study populations.

For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other lentiviruses infect most non-dividing cells nearly as well as dividing cells, while the gammaretroviruses such as the murine leukemia virus (MLV) cannot infect non-dividing cells, and other retroviruses have intermediate phenotypes. One exception to the ability of HIV to infect non-dividing cells involves resting CD4+ T cells in vitro where there are multiple restrictions. However, recent data show that there is massive infection of non-activated CD4+ T cell during acute infection which suggests that the situation is different in vivo. Finally, much work trying to explain the difference between HIV and MLV in non-dividing cells has focused on describing the ability of HIV to enter the nucleus during interphase. However, we suggest that events in the viral life-cycle other than nuclear import may be more important in determining the ability of a given retrovirus to infect non-dividing cells.","['Yamashita, Masahiro', 'Emerman, Michael']","['Yamashita M', 'Emerman M']","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/virology']",83,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00585-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 Jan 5;344(1):88-93. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.09.012.,"['R01 AI51153/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI30927/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a naturally occurring yellow pigment, isolated from the rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa that has traditionally been used in the treatment of injury and inflammation. But the effect and mechanism of action of curcumin on T cell leukemia is not known. To investigate the antitumor activity of curcumin in T cell leukemia, we examined its effect on constitutive phosphorylation of JAK and STAT proteins, proliferation, and apoptosis in HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines. HTLV-I-transformed T cell leukemia lines, MT-2, HuT-102, and SLB-1, express constitutively phosphorylated JAK3, TYK2, STAT3, and STAT5 signaling proteins. In vitro treatment with curcumin induced a dose-dependent decrease in JAK and STAT phosphorylation resulting in the induction of growth-arrest and apoptosis in T cell leukemia. The induction of growth-arrest and apoptosis in association with the blockade of constitutively active JAK-STAT pathway suggests this be a mechanism by which curcumin induces antitumor activity in T cell leukemia.","['Rajasingh, Johnson', 'Raikwar, Himanshu P', 'Muthian, Gladson', 'Johnson, Caroline', 'Bright, John J']","['Rajasingh J', 'Raikwar HP', 'Muthian G', 'Johnson C', 'Bright JJ']","['Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37212, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'TYK2 Kinase']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)02734-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Feb 10;340(2):359-68. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.014.

In this current work, we examined the effect of the LIF signaling pathway in embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation to a neural fate. METHODS: In the presence of LIF (1000 U/mL), the production of neuronal cells derived from embryoid bodies (EB) was tested under various culture conditions. Inhibition of the LIF pathway was examined with specific inhibitors. The effects of cell apoptosis and proliferation on neural differentiation were examined. ES cell differentiation into three-germ layers was compared. RESULTS: Under various culture conditions, neuronal differentiation was increased in the presence of LIF. Blocking the LIF-activated STAT3 signaling pathway with specific inhibitors abolished the neuronal differentiation of ES cells, whereas inhibition of the LIF-activated MEK signaling pathway impaired the differentiation of ES cells toward a glial fate. LIF suppressed cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation during ES cell differentiation. LIF inhibited the differentiation of ES cells to both mesoderm and extraembryonic endoderm fates, but enhanced the determination of neural progenitors. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LIF plays a positive role during the differentiation of ES cells into neuronal cells.","['He, Zhao', 'Li, Jing-jing', 'Zhen, Chang-hong', 'Feng, Lin-ying', 'Ding, Xiao-yan']","['He Z', 'Li JJ', 'Zhen CH', 'Feng LY', 'Ding XY']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology and Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology; Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/07/28 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00254.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2006 Jan;27(1):80-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00254.x.,,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cascades comprise an array of protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, GTP-binding proteins and adaptor proteins that regulate generic and specialised functions. The integration of these signals is essential for the normal development, homeostasis and function of T cells. Defects in a single mediator can produce T cells that are unable to participate fully in an immune response and/or that mount an inappropriate response, which leads to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity or leukaemia/lymphomas. This review highlights some of the key players in T-cell signalling and their involvement in the development of various clinical disease states. Some of these immune-specific signalling proteins are attractive potential targets in the development of therapies to augment T-cell responses to antigen or tumours, and to treat immune cell disorders.","['Wilkinson, Beverley', 'Downey, Jocelyn S', 'Rudd, Christopher E']","['Wilkinson B', 'Downey JS', 'Rudd CE']","['Molecular Immunology Section, Department of Immunology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus, Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Mol Med,Expert reviews in molecular medicine,100939725,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",217,2005/12/21 09:00,2007/10/19 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1462399405010264 [pii]', '10.1017/S1462399405010264 [doi]']",epublish,Expert Rev Mol Med. 2005 Dec 19;7(29):1-29. doi: 10.1017/S1462399405010264.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,20051219,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Prospective observational study of 120 randomly selected women who underwent IVF treatment. The concentration of LIF in serum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: There was no significant differences with regard to the systemic mean LIF concentration between the pregnant (42 patients, LIF: 11.55 pg/mL +/- 5.3 S.D.) and non-pregnant (66 patients, LIF: 13.47 pg/mL +/- 5.1 S.D.) women after IVF treatment. Likewise, for those women who have positive pregnancy after IVF treatment, the systemic mean LIF levels were not significantly different between women who have an ongoing pregnancy (34 ongoing pregnancy, LIF: 11.26 pg/mL +/- 5.2 S.D.) and those who had miscarriage (eight miscarriage, LIF: 12.78 pg/mL +/- 5.6 S.D.). CONCLUSION: The systemic levels of LIF concentration have no association with implantation rate or miscarriage rate in women undergoing IVF treatment. Measuring serum LIF concentration prior to embryo transfer in IVF treatment has no predictive value of implantation rate or miscarriage rate.","['Thum, Meen-yau', 'Abdalla, Hossam I', 'Bhaskaran, Shree', 'Harden, Emily L', 'Ford, Brian', 'Sumar, N', 'Shehata, Hassan', 'Bansal, Amolak S']","['Thum MY', 'Abdalla HI', 'Bhaskaran S', 'Harden EL', 'Ford B', 'Sumar N', 'Shehata H', 'Bansal AS']","['Lister Fertility Clinic, Lister Hospital, London, UK. mythum@doctors.net.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/*blood', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Female', '*Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/04/01 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['AJI328 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0897.2005.00328.x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2006 Jan;55(1):76-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2005.00328.x.,,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is diagnosed most commonly in the elderly with the median age at diagnosis being about 65 years. The purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) fludarabine, cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) and pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin) are highly active in CLL, both in previously treated and in refractory or relapsed patients. These three agents share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action such as induction of apoptosis. However, they also exhibit significant differences, especially in their interactions with enzymes involved in adenosine and deoxyadenosine metabolism. Recent randomised studies suggest that fludarabine and cladribine have similar activity in CLL. However, clinical observations indicate the existence of cross-resistance between fludarabine and cladribine. Patients who received PNAs as their initial therapy and achieved long-lasting response can be successfully retreated with the same agent. PNAs administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and/or monoclonal antibodies may produce higher response rates, including complete response (CR) or molecular CR, compared with PNAs alone or other treatment regimens. Management decisions are more difficult in elderly patients because of the apparent increase in toxicity of PNAs in this population. In elderly patients, we recommend chlorambucil as the first-line treatment, with PNAs in lower doses in refractory or relapsed patients. Myelosuppression and infections, including opportunistic varieties, are the most frequent adverse effects in patients with CLL treated with PNAs. Therefore, some investigators recommend routine antibacterial and antiviral prophylaxis during and after PNA treatment. This review presents current results and treatment strategies with the use of PNAs in CLL, especially in elderly patients.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, 93-513, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Purine Nucleosides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",180,2005/12/21 09:00,2006/03/21 09:00,['2005/12/21 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['22122 [pii]', '10.2165/00002512-200522120-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2005;22(12):983-1012. doi: 10.2165/00002512-200522120-00002.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reviews on Helicobacter and gastric neoplasia, innate defences against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, and the function of granulomas in tuberculosis also address aspects of tissue responses to bacterial infection. Following a review of the function of immunoglobulin A in defence against infection, a group of articles considers vaccination and gene therapy approaches, the latter involving consideration of both viral and bacterial strategies.

Specific cell membrane-associated transporters mediate drug resistance by effluxing a wide spectrum of toxic agents. Although several excellent reviews have addressed general aspects of drug resistance, this current review aims to highlight implications for the efficacy of folate-based and other types of chemotherapeutic drugs. Folates are vitamins that are daily required for many biosynthetic processes. Folate supplementation in our diet may convey protective effects against several diseases, including cancers, but folate supplementation also makes up an essential part of several current cancer chemotherapeutic regimens. Traditionally, the folate leucovorin, for instance, is used to reduce antifolate toxicity in leukemia or to enhance the effect of the fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorouracil in some solid tumors. More recently, it has also been noted that folic acid has the ability to increase antitumor activity of several structurally unrelated regimens, such as alimta/pemetrexed and cisplatin. Moreover, studies from our laboratory demonstrated that folates could modulate the expression and activity of at least two members of the MDR transporters: MRP1/ABCC1, and the breast cancer resistance protein BCRP/ABCG2. Thus, folate supplementation may have differential effects on chemotherapy: (1) reduction of toxicity, (2) increase of antitumor activity, and (3) induction of MRP1 and BCRP associated cellular drug resistance. In this review the role of MDR proteins is discussed in further detail for each of these three items from the perspective to optimally exploit folate supplementation for enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy of both antifolate-based chemotherapy and other classes of chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Hooijberg, J H', 'de Vries, N A', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Pieters, R', 'Jansen, G', 'Peters, G J']","['Hooijberg JH', 'de Vries NA', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Pieters R', 'Jansen G', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Folic Acid/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism']",149,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-005-0141-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2006 Jul;58(1):1-12. doi: 10.1007/s00280-005-0141-1.

This review examines the risk factors and therapy used for patients with an isolated CNS relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of 886 patients with de novo AML were reviewed, and patients who entered remission at the end of one course of therapy and developed an isolated CNS relapse as their first event were analyzed (n = 690). RESULTS: Thirty-three patients developed an isolated CNS relapse. Factors at diagnosis significantly associated with an isolated CNS relapse, compared with no CNS relapse, included age 0 to 2 years (70% v 27%, respectively; P < .001), enlarged liver (79% v 39%, respectively; P < .001) or spleen (79% v 39%, respectively; P < .001) at diagnosis, CNS disease at diagnosis (33% v 9%, respectively; P < .001), median WBC count (79.2 v 19.3 x 10(3) microL, respectively; P < .001), French-American-British M5 morphology (45% v 15%, respectively; P < .001), and chromosome 11 abnormalities (44% v 18%, respectively; P = .022). Treatment of the isolated CNS relapse varied from local therapy with intrathecal chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to systemic therapy with chemotherapy with or without bone marrow transplantation. Survival rate in the patients treated with local therapy was only 31.5% compared with 21.4% in patients treated with systemic therapy. The 8-year overall survival for patients after an isolated CNS relapse was similar to patients after a bone marrow relapse (26% +/- 16% v 21% +/- 5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Significant predictors for isolated CNS relapse were identified. This study demonstrated that there may be no benefit to systemic therapy versus CNS-directed therapy in outcome. The data support CNS-directed therapy to treat isolated CNS relapse.","['Johnston, Donna L', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Woods, William G']","['Johnston DL', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Lange BJ', 'Woods WG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. djohnston@cheo.on.ca""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/36/9172 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7482 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec 20;23(36):9172-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7482.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four HLA-A*0201-restricted WT1-derived epitopes have been identified: WT37, WT126, WT187, and WT235. We determined the natural immunogenecity of these antigens in patients with hematologic malignancies and healthy donor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To detect very low frequencies of WT1-specific CD8+ T cells, we used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to measure IFN-gamma mRNA production by WT1 peptide-pulsed CD8+ T cells from 12 healthy donors, 8 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, 6 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, and 8 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: Responses were detected in 5 of 8 chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, 4 of 6 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, and 7 of 12 healthy donors. No responses were detected in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The magnitude and extent of these CD8+ T-cell responses was greater in patients with myeloid leukemias than in healthy donors. Clonotypic analysis of WT1-specific CD8+ T cells directly ex vivo in one case showed that this naturally occurring population was oligoclonal. Using fluorescent peptide-MHC class I tetramers incorporating mutations in the alpha3 domain (D227K/T228A) that abrogate binding to the CD8 coreceptor, we were able to confirm the presence of high-avidity T-cell clones within the antigen-specific repertoire. CONCLUSION: The natural occurrence of high-avidity WT1-specific CD8+ T cells in the periphery could facilitate vaccination strategies to expand immune responses against myeloid leukemias.","['Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Brenchley, Jason M', 'Price, David A', 'Kilical, Yasemin', 'Gostick, Emma', 'Sewell, Andrew K', 'Li, Jongming', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Douek, Daniel C', 'Barrett, A John']","['Rezvani K', 'Brenchley JM', 'Price DA', 'Kilical Y', 'Gostick E', 'Sewell AK', 'Li J', 'Mielke S', 'Douek DC', 'Barrett AJ']","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung Blood Institute and Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. rezvanik@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/immunology/pharmacology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology/pharmacology']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/01/21 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/24/8799 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1314 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Dec 15;11(24 Pt 1):8799-807. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1314.,['G108/441/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These MRPs have strongly overlapping functional activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels of MRP1 to MRP6 and study their effect on prognosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The mRNA expression levels of MRP1 to MRP6 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in leukemic blasts of 105 de novo ALL patients (adults, n=49; children, n=56) including 70% B-lineage and 30% T-lineage ALL patients. RESULTS: Adults showed a higher expressions of MRP1 (P=0.008), MRP2 (P=0.026), and MRP3 (P=0.039) than children. Interestingly, this difference disappeared when patients were categorized based on clinical outcome. Relapsed patients showed a higher expression of all MRP genes, except MRP4. For the total group of ALL patients, the expressions of MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP5, and MRP6 predicted relapse. Moreover, high expression of all MRP genes, except MRP4, was associated with a reduced relapse-free survival in children and adults (MRP1, P=0.005; MRP2, P=0.008; MRP3, P=0.001; MRP5, P=0.016; MRP6, P=0.037).

It may be a growth or differentiation factor, play a role in angiogenesis, or protect against apoptosis. High serum YKL-40 is associated with poor prognosis in solid carcinomas. The aim was to examine serum YKL-40 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: YKL-40 was measured by ELISA in serum from 77 patients recently diagnosed with AML before and during the first month of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Forty (52%) of the AML patients had elevated serum YKL-40 (compared with age-matched healthy subjects) and their survival was shorter than in patients with normal serum YKL-40 (median, 128 days; interquartile range, 18-629 days versus 386 days; interquartile range, 180-901; P=0.018 Mann-Whitney test). Univariate analysis of serum YKL-40 (logarithmically transformed and treated as a continuous covariate) showed significant association with survival within the first month after start of chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.4; P=0.002], first 12 months (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0; P=0.0002), and overall survival (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6; P=0.003). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that serum YKL-40 was an independent prognostic variable for survival (first month: HR, 1.7; P=0.011; 12 months: HR, 1.6; P=0.0002; overall survival: HR, 1.4; P=0.002). High serum YKL-40 at start of chemotherapy was a risk factor for pneumonia within the first month, and serum YKL-40 increased (P=0.002) at time of pneumonia and was unchanged in patients without infections. CONCLUSIONS: Serum YKL-40 is a prognostic biomarker of survival in AML patients. Its role in AML and infections needs to be determined.","['Bergmann, Olav J', 'Johansen, Julia S', 'Klausen, Tobias W', 'Mylin, Anne K', 'Kristensen, Jorgen S', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Johnsen, Hans E']","['Bergmann OJ', 'Johansen JS', 'Klausen TW', 'Mylin AK', 'Kristensen JS', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Johnsen HE']","['Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Herlev University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. ojb@ribeamt.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adipokines', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/blood/diagnosis/microbiology', 'Prognosis']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/01/21 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/24/8644 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1317 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Dec 15;11(24 Pt 1):8644-52. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1317.,,"['0 (Adipokines)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CHI3L1 protein, human)', '0 (Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-three pretreatment tumor biopsies were taken during diagnostic panendoscopy and examined for Mcl-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-R2, CD9, and 14-3-3sigma expression by immunohistochemistry. Forty-three patients underwent primary radiotherapy, of which, 29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy (low dose daily cisplatin, mitomycin C bolus). The primary end-point was locoregional tumor control 6 months after completion of radiotherapy. Mcl-1, VEGF-R2, CD9, and 14-3-3sigma expression were correlated with patients' primary response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and with established clinicopathologic variables. RESULTS: Thirty complete and 13 partial responses were observed in our patient group. High expression levels of Mcl-1 (P=0.021), VEGF-R2 (P=0.032), and 14-3-3sigma (P=0.013), but not of CD9, in tumor biopsies was correlated with complete response. Overexpression of at least two of the three aforementioned proteins in pretreatment biopsies predicted-with a likelihood of 80%-whether a patient would achieve complete response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, if only one of these proteins is overexpressed, there is a likelihood of 84.6% that this patient would not completely respond to therapy. CONCLUSION: Determining the expression levels of Mcl-1, VEGF-R2, and 14-3-3sigma may be helpful in predicting the early clinical response in head and neck tumor patients receiving primary radiotherapy and chemotherapy and may further allow a pretherapeutic selection of patients.","['Erovic, Boban M', 'Pelzmann, Martina', 'Grasl, Matthaus Ch', 'Pammer, Johannes', 'Kornek, Gabriela', 'Brannath, Werner', 'Selzer, Edgar', 'Thurnher, Dietmar']","['Erovic BM', 'Pelzmann M', 'Grasl MCh', 'Pammer J', 'Kornek G', 'Brannath W', 'Selzer E', 'Thurnher D']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Division of Oncology and Medical Statistics, Center of Excellence for Clinical and Experimental Oncology, University of Vienna Medical School, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Exonucleases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Exoribonucleases', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/analysis/*metabolism']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/01/21 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/24/8632 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1170 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Dec 15;11(24 Pt 1):8632-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1170.,,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (SFN protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies suggested that altered PDCD5 expression may have significant implications in CML progression. The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) promoter region and show their functional relevance to PDCD5 expression as well as their genetic susceptibility to CML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred twenty-nine CML subjects and 211 healthy controls were recruited for identification of SNPs and subsequent genetic analysis. Luciferase reporter assays were carried out to show the functional significance of the SNPs located in the promoter region to PDCD5 expression. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis were done to determine the expression differences of PDCD5 in CML patients with different genotypes. RESULTS: Two SNPs were identified within the PDCD5 promoter. They are -27A>G and -11G>A (transcription start site as position 1), respectively. The complete linkage disequilibrium was found between these two polymorphisms. The frequencies of -27G+/-11A+ genotype and -27G/-11A allele were significantly higher in CML patients than in healthy controls (genotype: 26.36% versus 11.85%, chi2=11.75, P<0.01; allele: 13.57% versus 6.40%, chi2=9.48, P<0.01). Luciferase reporter assays revealed that the promoter with -27G/-11A had significantly lower transcriptional activity and could not be up-regulated after apoptotic stimulations compared with the promoter with -27A/-11G. PDCD5 expression analysis in mononuclear cells derived from CML patients and cell lines with different -27/-11 genotypes showed consistent results with the reporter assays.

However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the immunosuppression has remained unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that the leukemia cells from a subset of patients with ATL express Foxp3, a specific marker for CD25+CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which regulate the immune response by suppressing CD4+ T cell functions. However, whether there is a functional resemblance between ATL cells that have Foxp3 expression and Treg cells is still unknown. In this report, we confirmed the high expression of Foxp3 in leukemia cells from 5 of 12 ATL patients and demonstrated that ATL cells from 3 patients suppressed the proliferation of CD4+ T cells. Similarly, one of six HTLV-I-infected cell lines showed both high Foxp3 expression and suppressive activity. Like Treg cells, the suppression induced by the ATL cells from two patients and the HTLV-infected cell line appeared to be mediated by a cell-cell contact-dependent mechanism. Nevertheless, among the ATL cells that strongly expressed Foxp3, those from two of the five patients showed no apparent suppressive activity. Furthermore, retroviral transfection of Foxp3 did not confer any suppressive function on low Foxp3-expressing HTLV-I-infected cell lines. These results indicate that Foxp3 may be essential but is not sufficient for the Treg-cell-like suppressive activity of ATL cells and HTLV-I-infected cell lines.","['Chen, Shuming', 'Ishii, Naoto', 'Ine, Shouji', 'Ikeda, Syuichi', 'Fujimura, Taku', 'Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C', 'Soroosh, Pejman', 'Tada, Kohtaro', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Kameoka, Junichi', 'Kasai, Noriyuki', 'Sasaki, Takeshi', 'Sugamura, Kazuo']","['Chen S', 'Ishii N', 'Ine S', 'Ikeda S', 'Fujimura T', 'Ndhlovu LC', 'Soroosh P', 'Tada K', 'Harigae H', 'Kameoka J', 'Kasai N', 'Sasaki T', 'Sugamura K']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/08/24 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['dxh366 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxh366 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2006 Feb;18(2):269-77. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxh366.

Epoxyquinone A monomer (EqM), a synthetic derivative of the natural product epoxyquinol A, has previously been shown to be a potent inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced activation of NF-kappaB, but the mechanism by which EqM inhibits NF-kappaB activation was not known. In this report, we show that EqM blocks activation of NF-kappaB by inhibiting two molecular targets: IkappaB kinase IKKbeta and NF-kappaB subunit p65. EqM inhibits TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation by targeting IKKbeta, and an alanine substitution for Cys179 in the activation loop of IKKbeta makes it resistant to EqM-mediated inhibition. EqM also directly inhibits DNA binding by p65, but not p50; moreover, replacement of Cys38 in p65 with Ser abolishes EqM-mediated inhibition of DNA binding. Pretreatment of cells with reducing agent dithiothreitol dose-dependently reduces EqM-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB, further suggesting that EqM directly modifies the thiol group of Cys residues in protein targets. Modifications of the exocyclic alkene of EqM substantially reduce EqM's ability to inhibit NF-kappaB activation. In the human SUDHL-4 lymphoma cell line, EqM inhibits both proliferation and NF-kappaB DNA binding, and activates caspase-3 activity. EqM also effectively inhibits the growth of human leukemia, kidney, and colon cancer cell lines in the NCI's tumor cell panel. Among six colon cancer cell lines, those with low amounts of constitutive NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity are generally more sensitive to growth inhibition by EqM. Taken together, these results suggest that EqM inhibits growth and induces cell death in tumor cells through a mechanism that involves inhibition of NF-kappaB activity at multiple steps in the signaling pathway.","['Liang, Mei-Chih', 'Bardhan, Sujata', 'Pace, Emily A', 'Rosman, Diana', 'Beutler, John A', 'Porco, John A Jr', 'Gilmore, Thomas D']","['Liang MC', 'Bardhan S', 'Pace EA', 'Rosman D', 'Beutler JA', 'Porco JA Jr', 'Gilmore TD']","['Department of Biology, Boston University, 5 Cummington Street, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00777-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Feb 28;71(5):634-45. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.11.013.

The heterogeneity of the non-DC mononuclear phagocyte population in human lymphoid tissue has been little addressed. Here, we studied the expression of 2 monocyte-derived markers, CD14 and CD169 (sialoadhesin), in reactive human lymphoid tissue as well as in a series of 51 B-cell lymphomas by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue. We confirmed that lymph node sinusoidal monocyte-derived cells were the only population staining for CD169. Although most sinusoidal histiocytes also expressed CD14, monocyte-derived cells with phagocytosis such as erythrophagocytosis, anthracosis, or tingible bodies macrophage lacked CD14 and CD169. Among B-cell lymphomas, splenic marginal zone lymphoma was the only one associated with an expansion of the CD14(+)CD169(+) cells in the cords. With respect to nodal B-cell lymphomas, CD14(+) cells were rare among B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, strikingly, we found a strong expansion of CD14(+)CD169(-) cells in numerous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), except in cases associated with numerous mitoses, apoptotic bodies, and tingible bodies macrophages. When cultivated in granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor/interleukin 4, DLBCL purified CD14(+) cells differentiate into plasmacytoid cells, expressing DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin, suggesting dendritic cell differentiation potential. Our observation fits well with the lymph node and host response cluster signatures described in the gene profiling signatures of DLBCL.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 262 patients with history of prior nongynecologic malignancy who underwent laparoscopy for management of an adnexal mass between 1/1992 and 6/2004. RESULTS: Median patient age at laparoscopy was 55 years (range, 20-91 years), and median BMI was 25 kg/m2 (range, 14-41 kg/m2). Of the 262 patients, 145 (55.3%) had prior abdominal/pelvic surgery. Prior cancer history included breast (202, 77.1%), lymphoma/leukemia (16, 6.1%), colorectal (8, 3.0%), lung (7, 2.7%), multiple myeloma (5, 1.9%), head/neck (5, 1.9%), genitourinary (5, 1.9%), upper gastrointestinal (4, 1.5%), and other (10, 3.8%). Median ovarian mass diameter measured on radiologic imaging was 3.8 cm (range, 0.2-13.5 cm); median CA-125 was 17.0 U/mL (range, 1-7000 U/mL). In all, 49 (18.7%) patients had malignancy identified at laparoscopy, with 30/49 (61.2%) diagnosed with metastatic malignancy to the ovary and 19/49 (38.8%) having a new primary ovarian malignancy. Median tumor diameter and CA-125 were significantly higher in women found to have a malignancy (4.7 vs. 3.7 cm, and 35 vs. 14 U/mL, respectively). Overall, conversion to laparotomy occurred in 34 (12.9%) cases. Twenty-one of 49 (42.9%) patients with malignancy were converted to laparotomy compared with 13/213 (6.1%) when benign disease was noted (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in 5 patients with a history of nongynecologic malignancy who were selected for laparoscopic management of an adnexal mass was found to have malignancy, with 60% being metastatic from other primaries.

METHODS: The mechanism of GaC-Tf-FeN transporting into and out of HL60 cells has been investigated by comparing transports between GaC-Tf-FeN and apoTf by means of 125I-labeled transferrin. RESULTS: An association constant for GaC-Tf-FeN was 2 times that for apoTf. GaC-Tf-FeN and apoTf of cell surface-bound displayed similar kinetics during the uptake, but the release rates of internalized GaC-Tf-FeN and apoTf from cells were different which showed characteristic disparate. The release continued to occur during the incubation of GaC-Tf-FeN in the presence of nonradioactive apoTf. Neither NaN3 nor NH4Cl could completely block internalization of GaC-Tf-FeN, but they prevented the release of GaC-Tf-FeN from the cells. Excess cold unlabeled apoTf could overcome the block in the release due to NH4Cl but not NaN3. The binding and internalization of GaC-Tf-FeN could be competitively inhibited by nonradioactive apoTf. It implies that both bind to the same receptor on the membrane and the localization of GaC-Tf-FeN resembles that of apoTf inside cells. Pretreated cells with pronase abolished the binding of GaC-Tf-FeN significantly. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these findings, we proposed the ""transferrin receptor"" for the mechanism of GaC-Tf-FeN transport by HL60 cells.","['Li, Ying-Qi', 'Liu, Bin', 'Zhao, Chun-Gui', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Yang, Bin-Sheng']","['Li YQ', 'Liu B', 'Zhao CG', 'Zhang W', 'Yang BS']","['Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, Institute of Molecular Science, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030006, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Apoproteins/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gallium/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Iron/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Pronase/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*physiology', 'Sodium Azide/pharmacology', 'Transferrin/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-8981(05)00631-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2005.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2006 Apr;366(1-2):225-32. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2005.10.012.

The use of stable-isotope tracers and the analysis of the distribution of labeled carbons in various intermediates, by both mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, allow the role of several metabolic processes in cell growth and death to be defined. In the present paper we describe the metabolic profiling of Jurkat cells by isotopomer analysis using (13)C-NMR spectroscopy and [1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose as the stable-isotope tracer. The isotopomer analysis of the lactate, alanine, glutamate, proline, serine, glycine, malate and ribose-5-phosphate moiety of nucleotides has allowed original integrated information regarding the pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and amino acid metabolism in proliferating human leukemia T cells to be obtained. In particular, the contribution of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and transketolase activities to phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthesis was evaluated directly by the determination of isotopomers of the [1'-(13)C], [4',5'-(13)C(2)]ribosyl moiety of nucleotides. Furthermore, the relative contribution of the glycolysis and pentose cycle to lactate production was estimated via analysis of lactate isotopomers. Interestingly, pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase flux ratios measured by glutamate isotopomers and the production of isotopomers of several metabolites showed that the metabolic processes described could not take place simultaneously in the same macrocompartments (cells). Results revealed a heterogeneous metabolism in an asynchronous cell population that may be interpreted on the basis of different metabolic phenotypes of subpopulations in relation to different cell cycle phases.","['Miccheli, A', 'Tomassini, A', 'Puccetti, C', 'Valerio, M', 'Peluso, G', 'Tuccillo, F', 'Calvani, M', 'Manetti, C', 'Conti, F']","['Miccheli A', 'Tomassini A', 'Puccetti C', 'Valerio M', 'Peluso G', 'Tuccillo F', 'Calvani M', 'Manetti C', 'Conti F']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Rome La Sapienza, P.le Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,IM,"['Carbon Isotopes', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Citric Acid Cycle/physiology', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Glycine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway/physiology', 'Pentoses/metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(05)00234-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2005.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2006 May;88(5):437-48. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2005.10.004.

By developing a host-vector system on the basis of the multiple protease-deficient B. subtilis strain WB700 and a multicopy plasmid containing two tandemly positioned strong promoters plus an efficient signal sequence, the hIL-3 protein was efficiently produced and secreted into the growth medium. As verified by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and cross-linking experiments with a thiol-specific reagent, intact and properly folded hIL-3 was purified from the B. subtilis growth medium. Bioactivity tests showed that the isolated hIL-3 was able to specifically induce proliferation of the hIL-3-dependent leukaemia cell line MO7e.

The ototoxicity of vincristine has been related to high dosage, while low and moderate doses do not seem to induce significant hearing impairment when measured by pure tone or speech audiometry. Otoacoustic emissions have been reported to be more sensitive in early detection of ototoxicity than conventional pure tone audiometry. The present study was directed at determining whether vincristine treatment interferes with outer hair cell function in the absence of measurable changes in pure tone audiometry. METHODS: We studied prospectively a cohort of ten children suffering from leukemia. All children were subjected to tympanogram, stapedial muscle reflex, pure tone audiometry, transient evoked (TEOAEs) and distortion product (DPOAEs) otoacoustic emissions on day 1 and on day 22 of treatment with vincristine. TEOAEs were analyzed in terms of emission level and reproducibility as a function of frequency. DPOAEs were obtained as DP-grams and were analyzed in terms of amplitude. RESULTS: The analyzed parameters of TEOAEs and DPOAEs revealed a declining tendency, although changes did not reach statistical significance. Pure tone audiometry and stapedial reflex thresholds were not altered. CONCLUSION: For the population of this study, vincristine did not seem to cause significant alterations of otoacoustic emissions' recordings and consequently significant outer hair cell damage.","['Riga, M', 'Psarommatis, I', 'Korres, S', 'Lyra, Ch', 'Papadeas, E', 'Varvutsi, M', 'Ferekidis, E', 'Apostolopoulos, N']","['Riga M', 'Psarommatis I', 'Korres S', 'Lyra Ch', 'Papadeas E', 'Varvutsi M', 'Ferekidis E', 'Apostolopoulos N']","['ENT Department, University Hospital of Patras, Greece. mariariga@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,8003603,IM,"['Acoustic Impedance Tests', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Audiometry, Pure-Tone', 'Auditory Threshold/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cochlea/*drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditory/*drug effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous/*drug effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reflex, Acoustic/*drug effects', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Stapes/drug effects', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-5876(05)00503-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijporl.2005.10.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2006 Jun;70(6):1003-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2005.10.011.

Furthermore, there is no study reported on effects of used therapy on this relation. The present study was designed to asses the relationships between the serum concentrations of sFas, sFasL and sTRAIL in patients with B-CLL regarding their correlation with clinical stage and used therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 40 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) at diagnosis, before treatment and four weeks after therapy. To measure sFas, sFasL and sTRAIL levels in serum commercially available ELISA kits were used. RESULTS: We found increased concentrations of sFas in sera of all patients with B-CLL before treatment in comparison to the control group. There were no significant differences in concentrations of sFasL and sTRAIL between patients and control group. Increased sFasL concentrations after FC and CC therapy as well as decreased concentrations after 2CdA therapy in comparison to values before treatment were found. The concentrations of sTRAIL after FC and CC therapy were higher than those in patients before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Results obtained suggest that relationship between sFas, sFasL and sTRAIL in sera of patients with B-CLL before treatment may facilitate the growth B leukemic cells. Changes in these relations after therapy with FC and CC can make a contribution to inhibit B cells growth on the apoptosis way in this patient group.","['Jablonska, E', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska, B', 'Rogowski, F', 'Parfienczyk, A', 'Puzewska, W', 'Bukin, M']","['Jablonska E', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska B', 'Rogowski F', 'Parfienczyk A', 'Puzewska W', 'Bukin M']","['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland. ewaj@amb.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Rocz Akad Med Bialymst,Roczniki Akademii Medycznej w Bialymstoku (1995),9515551,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Solubility', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*blood', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'fas Receptor/*blood']",,2005/12/20 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/12/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rocz Akad Med Bialymst. 2005;50:204-7.,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: hTRF1cDNA sequences were obtained from GenBank, its genome structure and pseudogenes were forecasted by BLAST and other biology information programs and then testified by sequencing. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hTRF1mRNA in 10 cell line cells, including myelogenous leukemia cell lines K562, HL-60, U-937, NB4, THP-1, HEL and Dami; lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines 6T-CEM, Jurkat and Raji. Telomerase activities of cells were detected by using telomeric repeat amplification (TRAP)-ELISA protocol. PCR and sequencing were used to detect mutation of each exon of hTRF1 in 10 cell line cells. RESULTS: hTRF1 gene, mapped to 8q13, was divided into 10 exons and spans 38.6 kb. Four processed pseudogenes of hTRF1 located on chromosome 13, 18, 21 and X respectively, was named as PsihTRF1-13, PsihTRF1-18, PsihTRF1-21 and PsihTRF1-X respectively. All cell line cells showed positive telomerase activity. The expression of hTRF1 was significantly lower in malignant hematopoietic cell lines cells (0.0338, 0.0108-0.0749) than in normal mononuclear cells (0.0493, 0.0369-0.128) (P=0.004). But no significant mutation was found in all exons of hTRF1 in 10 cell line cells. Four variants were found in part of intron 1, 2 and 8 of hTRF1. Their infection on gene function is unknown and needs further studies. CONCLUSION: hTRF1 mutation is probably not one of the main factors for telomerase activation in malignant hematopoietic disease.","['Sun, Jie', 'Huang, He', 'Zhu, Yuan-yuan', 'Lan, Jian-ping', 'Li, Jing-yuan', 'Lai, Xiao-yu', 'Yu, Jian']","['Sun J', 'Huang H', 'Zhu YY', 'Lan JP', 'Li JY', 'Lai XY', 'Yu J']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,Journal of Zhejiang University.

In this regard, Treg seem to play an important role in mediating maternal tolerance to the fetus. We proposed a crucial role of T regulatory cells (Treg) in avoiding immunological rejection of the fetus after observing diminished number and function of Treg in abortion-prone mice. We further confirmed the protective role of Treg during pregnancy by transferring pregnancy-induced Treg into abortion-prone mice, which prevented rejection. Here, we analyzed the mechanisms involved in Treg-mediated protection. As expected, Treg therapy prevented abortion, while expanding the peripheral and thymic Treg population. Surprisingly, the decidual levels of the Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were not diminished after therapy. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of leukemia inhibitory factor, TGF-beta and heme oxygenase-1 at the fetal-maternal interface were dramatically up-regulated after Treg transfer, while the levels of indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase remained unchanged. Our data suggest that Treg treatment can not prevent T cell infiltration or high Th1 levels but is able to create a privileged tolerant microenvironment at the fetal-maternal interface, further shedding light onto the molecular mechanisms involved in pregnancy tolerance.","['Zenclussen, Ana C', 'Gerlof, Katrin', 'Zenclussen, Maria L', 'Ritschel, Stefanie', 'Zambon Bertoja, Annarosa', 'Fest, Stefan', 'Hontsu, Shigeto', 'Ueha, Satoshi', 'Matsushima, Kouji', 'Leber, Joachim', 'Volk, Hans-Dieter']","['Zenclussen AC', 'Gerlof K', 'Zenclussen ML', 'Ritschel S', 'Zambon Bertoja A', 'Fest S', 'Hontsu S', 'Ueha S', 'Matsushima K', 'Leber J', 'Volk HD']","['Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Medical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany. ana.zenclussen@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Decidua/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fetus/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/immunology/metabolism', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Mice', 'Neuropilin-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/02/18 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200535428 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2006 Jan;36(1):82-94. doi: 10.1002/eji.200535428.,,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)']",['Eur J Immunol. 2006 Aug;36(8):2273-4; author reply 2274-5.

Artemis and Lig4 are the only known V(D)J/NHEJ factors found deficient in human genetic disorders. Null mutations of the Artemis gene result in a complete absence of T and B lymphocytes and increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiations, causing radiosensitive-SCID. Mutations of Lig4 are exclusively hypomorphic and have only been described in six patients, four exhibiting mild immunodeficiency associated with microcephaly and developmental delay, while two patient had leukemia. Here we report a SCID associated with microcephaly caused by compound heterozygous hypomorphic mutations in Lig4. Residual activity of Lig4 in these patients is underscored by a normal pattern of TCR-alpha and -beta junctions in the T cells of the patients and a moderate impairment of V(D)J recombination as tested in vitro.

The malignant cells in T-ALL and T-LL are morphologically indistinguishable, and they share the expression of common cell surface antigens and cytogenetic characteristics. However, despite these similarities, differences in the clinical behavior of T-ALL and T-LL are observed. PROCEDURE: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of T-ALL and T-LL samples obtained from Children's Oncology Group (COG) tumor banks using DNA arrays. Immunohistochemistry was also performed to validate the expression of selected targets. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all samples showed complete segregation of T-ALL and T-LL into distinct clusters. Next, we identified the top 201 genes that best differentiated T-ALL from T-LL using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), a supervised statistical approach. Genes representing several functional groups were differentially expressed in T-LL and T-ALL. Prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) identified a subset of genes, which accurately classified all 19 T-ALL and T-LL samples with an overall misclassification error rate of 0. Immunohistochemical validation of protein expression of selected genes identified by microarray analysis confirmed overexpression of MLL-1 in T-LL tumor cells compared to T-ALL and CD47 in T-ALL tumors cells when compared to T-LL. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant similarities between the malignant T-cell precursors, clear differences in the gene expression profiles were observed between T-ALL and T-LL implying underlying differences in the biology of the two entities.","['Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Smock, Kristi', 'Philip, Mary', 'Carroll, William L', 'Min, Dong-Joon']","['Raetz EA', 'Perkins SL', 'Bhojwani D', 'Smock K', 'Philip M', 'Carroll WL', 'Min DJ']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA. elizabeth.raetz@mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20550 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Aug;47(2):130-40. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20550.,['U01 CA88361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the study was closed, concluding that the probability of a good response in this patient-group was most likely to be less than 30%. By that time, another four patients had been enrolled, of which one patient with a late relapsed AML FAB type M7 showed a good response. Toxicity of MTX was limited and tolerable.

On the basis of our previously gathered genetic and biochemical data, we proposed a model that splits NS- and leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations into two major classes of activating lesions with differential perturbing effects on development and hematopoiesis. To test this model, we investigated further the diversity of germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations, delineated the association of those mutations with disease, characterized biochemically a panel of mutant SHP-2 proteins recurring in NS, LS, and leukemia, and performed molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural effects of selected mutations. Our results document a strict correlation between the identity of the lesion and disease and demonstrate that NS-causative mutations have less potency for promoting SHP-2 gain of function than do leukemia-associated ones. Furthermore, we show that the recurrent LS-causing Y279C and T468M amino acid substitutions engender loss of SHP-2 catalytic activity, identifying a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of missense PTPN11 mutations.","['Tartaglia, Marco', 'Martinelli, Simone', 'Stella, Lorenzo', 'Bocchinfuso, Gianfranco', 'Flex, Elisabetta', 'Cordeddu, Viviana', 'Zampino, Giuseppe', 'Burgt, Ineke van der', 'Palleschi, Antonio', 'Petrucci, Tamara C', 'Sorcini, Mariella', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Foa, Robin', 'Emanuel, Peter D', 'Gelb, Bruce D']","['Tartaglia M', 'Martinelli S', 'Stella L', 'Bocchinfuso G', 'Flex E', 'Cordeddu V', 'Zampino G', 'Burgt Iv', 'Palleschi A', 'Petrucci TC', 'Sorcini M', 'Schoch C', 'Foa R', 'Emanuel PD', 'Gelb BD']","['Dipartimento di Biologia Cellulare e Neuroscienze, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. mtartaglia@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'LEOPARD Syndrome/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Noonan Syndrome/*genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/chemistry/*genetics']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9297(07)62359-3 [pii]', '10.1086/499925 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 2006 Feb;78(2):279-90. doi: 10.1086/499925.

In spite of the clinical importance, the molecular mechanism for this chromosomal translocation has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we employed 2-color FISH and detected intracellular chromosomal translocations induced by etoposide treatment. Cells such as ataxia-telangiectasia mutated-deficient fibroblasts and U2OS cells, in which the early G2/M checkpoint after treatment with low concentrations of etoposide has been lost, executed mitosis with etoposide-induced DNA double-strand breaks, and 2-color FISH signals located on either side of the MLL gene were segregated in the postmitotic G1 phase. Long-term culture of cells that had executed mitosis under etoposide treatment showed frequent structural abnormalities of chromosome 11. These findings provide convincing evidence for Topo II inhibitor-induced 11q23 translocation. Our study also suggests an important role of the early G2/M checkpoint in preventing fixation of chromosomal abnormalities and reveals environmental and genetic risk factors for the development of chromosome 11 translocations, namely, low concentrations of Topo II inhibitors and dysfunctional early G2/M checkpoint control.","['Nakada, Shinichiro', 'Katsuki, Yoko', 'Imoto, Issei', 'Yokoyama, Tetsuji', 'Nagasawa, Masayuki', 'Inazawa, Johji', 'Mizutani, Shuki']","['Nakada S', 'Katsuki Y', 'Imoto I', 'Yokoyama T', 'Nagasawa M', 'Inazawa J', 'Mizutani S']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Graduate Medical School, and Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/drug effects/*genetics', 'Osteosarcoma', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI25716 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2006 Jan;116(1):80-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI25716.

A subset of T-B-NK+ SCID patients is sensitive to ionizing radiation, and the majority of these patients have mutations in Artemis. We present a patient with a new type of radiosensitive T-B-NK+ SCID with a defect in DNA ligase IV (LIG4). To date, LIG4 mutations have only been described in a radiosensitive leukemia patient and in 4 patients with a designated LIG4 syndrome, which is associated with chromosomal instability, pancytopenia, and developmental and growth delay. The patient described here shows that a LIG4 mutation can also cause T-B-NK+ SCID without developmental defects. The LIG4-deficient SCID patient had an incomplete but severe block in precursor B cell differentiation, resulting in extremely low levels of blood B cells. The residual D(H)-J(H) junctions showed extensive nucleotide deletions, apparently caused by prolonged exonuclease activity during the delayed D(H)-J(H) ligation process.

We designed a pilot study to target DNA methylation and histone deacetylation through the sequential administration of 5-azacytidine followed by sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ten evaluable patients (eight AML, two MDS) were treated with seven consecutive daily subcutaneous injections of 5-azacytidine at 75 mg/m2 followed by 5 days of sodium PB given intravenously at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Five patients (50%) were able to achieve a beneficial clinical response (partial remission or stable disease). One patient with MDS proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and is alive without evidence of disease 39 months later. The combination regimen was well tolerated with common toxicities of injection site skin reaction (90% of the patients) from 5-azacytidine, and somnolence/fatigue from the sodium PB infusion (80% of the patients). Correlative laboratory studies demonstrated the consistent reacetylation of histone H4, although no relationship with the clinical response could be demonstrated. Results from this pilot study demonstrate that a combination approach targeting different mechanisms of transcriptional modulation is clinically feasible with acceptable toxicity and measurable biologic and clinical outcomes.","['Maslak, P', 'Chanel, S', 'Camacho, L H', 'Soignet, S', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Guernah, I', 'Warrell, R', 'Nimer, S']","['Maslak P', 'Chanel S', 'Camacho LH', 'Soignet S', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Guernah I', 'Warrell R', 'Nimer S']","['Department of Clinical Laboratories, New York, NY, USA. maslakp@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Phenylbutyrates/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404050 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404050 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):212-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404050.,"['P01 CA05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA82740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '7WY7YBI87E (4-phenylbutyric acid)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathophysiology of MM-induced angiogenesis is complex and involves both direct production of angiogenic cytokines by plasma cells and their induction within the microenvironment. The latter are secreted by stromal cells, endothelial cells (EC) and osteoclasts, and promote plasma cell growth, survival and migration, as well as paracrine cytokine secretion and angiogenesis in the bone marrow milieu. Angiogenesis is also supported by inflammatory cells following their recruitment and activation by plasma cells.

The precise mechanism of TLX1 function remains poorly understood, although it is known that it can act as both a transcriptional activator and repressor and can downregulate the Aldh1a1 gene in embryonic mouse spleen. Using a whole-genome PCR approach, we show here that TLX1 protein directly interacts with pericentromeric human satellite 2 DNA sequences. Such DNA is known to localize to heterochromatin, which among other roles has been implicated in gene silencing. The interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by gel retardation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays involving satellite 2 DNA, which contained sequences resembling TLX1 binding sites. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, TLX1 demonstrated a punctate pattern of staining in the nuclei of leukemic T-cells (ALL-SIL). Double labelling indicated that TLX1 colocalized with the centromeric protein CENP-B, demonstrating that the TLX1 foci corresponded to clusters of centromeric DNA. The novel interaction of TLX1 with constitutive heterochromatin adds an additional level of complexity to the intracellular functions of this transcriptional regulator and may have relevance to its roles in transcriptional repression and T-cell immortalization.","['Heidari, M', 'Rice, K L', 'Phillips, J K', 'Kees, U R', 'Greene, W K']","['Heidari M', 'Rice KL', 'Phillips JK', 'Kees UR', 'Greene WK']","['1School of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Division of Health Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Centromere/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Satellite/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404071 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404071 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):304-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404071.,,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since current chemotherapy fails in >50% of patients with MLL, new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. For this, understanding the biological features characterizing MLL is necessary. Analysis of gene expression profiles revealed that the expression of the tumor suppressor gene FHIT is reduced in children with MLL rearranged ALL as compared to ALL patients carrying germ line MLL. This finding was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. In 100% of the infant MLL cases tested, methylation of the FHIT 5'CpG region was observed, resulting in strongly reduced mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, FHIT methylation in infant and non-infant ALL patients carrying germ line MLL was found in only approximately 60% (P< or =0.004). FHIT expression was restored upon exposing leukemic cells to the demethylating agent decitabine, which induced apoptosis. Likewise and more specifically, leukemic cell death was induced by transfecting MLL rearranged leukemic cells with expression vectors encoding wild-type FHIT, confirming tumor suppressor activity of this gene. These observations imply that suppression of FHIT may be required for the development of MLL, and provide new insights into leukemogenesis and therapeutic possibilities for MLL.","['Stam, R W', 'den Boer, M L', 'Passier, M M C J', 'Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Sallan, S E', 'Armstrong, S A', 'Pieters, R']","['Stam RW', 'den Boer ML', 'Passier MM', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Sallan SE', 'Armstrong SA', 'Pieters R']","[""Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404074 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404074 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):264-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404074.,,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, this explanation is relevant only to initial stages of stem-cell-dependent tumors (such as chronic myeloid leukemia) that, actually, are well controlled by therapy. In advanced cancers that poorly respond to therapy, quiescent tumor stem cells play a negligible role. Instead, proliferating cells determine disease progression, prognosis, therapeutic failures, and resistance to therapy. And therapy fails not because it eliminates only proliferating tumor cells, but because it does not eliminate them. With noticeable exceptions, it is the proliferating cell that should be targeted, whereas resting cancer cells including stem and dormant cells need to be targeted only when they 'wake up'.

The genomic breakpoint was in intron 7 of RUNX1 and intron 1 of USP42. The reciprocal chimera was not detected - neither on the transcriptional nor on the genomic level - and FISH showed that the 5' part of USP42 was deleted. USP42 maps to a 7p22 region characterized by segmental duplications. Notably, 17 kb duplicons are present 1 Mb proximal to USP42 and 3 Mb proximal to RUNX1; these may be important in the genesis of t(7;21). This is the second cryptic RUNX1 translocation in hematologic malignancies and the first in AML. The USPs have not previously been reported to be rearranged in leukemias. The cellular context in which USP42 is active is unknown, but we here show that it is expressed in normal bone marrow, in primary AMLs, and in cancer cell lines.

This review highlights recent findings regarding the genes associated with chromosomal translocations. RECENT FINDINGS: A great number of novel fusion genes associated with chromosomal translocations have been cloned. These novel fusion genes are found in the smaller part of various malignancies, and it can be expected that the significance of novel fusion gene occurrence for oncogenesis will be clarified in the not too distant future. Observation of high frequencies of mutations in NOTCH1, NPM and JAK2 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype and myeloproliferative disorders (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis) have provided important suggestions for a better understanding of chromosomal translocations. This is because all these genes had already been identified as genes associated with chromosomal translocations in a small subset of specific phenotypes of hematologic malignancies. SUMMARY: This review summarizes recent findings associated with chromosomal translocations including newly identified fusion genes, a novel mechanism of fusion gene formation and their relevance for novel targeted therapies. Continuing attempts to identify genes associated with chromosomal translocations can be expected to provide further insights into the significance of various gene alterations in cancer and the development of novel targeted therapies.","['Taki, Tomohiko', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Taki T', 'Taniwaki M']","['Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",46,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/06/21 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001622-200601000-00011 [pii]', '10.1097/01.cco.0000198972.69541.04 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2006 Jan;18(1):62-8. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000198972.69541.04.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitivity of HSCs to IL-6 has been previously studied, in part by measuring the expression of IL-6R on the membrane (mIL-6R). Several studies have described the regulation of cell surface expression of IL-6R by several cytokines, but the role of glycoprotein 130 activation has not yet been investigated. In this study, CD133(+) cells were purified from adult peripheral blood and were precultured in the absence or presence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for selection of quiescent HSCs. Cells were cultured with continuous or pulsed stimulations of an IL-6-sIL-6R fusion protein (hyperinterleukin-6 [HIL-6]) to 1) detect mIL-6R by flow cytometry, 2) assess mIL-6R and sIL-6R RNAs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 3) measure sIL-6R in supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 4) analyze cell-cycle status, and 5) perform long-term culture-initiating cell assays. The level of mIL-6R(-) cells was preserved by 5-FU incubation. HIL-6 increased steady-state mIL-6R RNA and expression rate on HSCs, independently of treatment with 5-FU. Enhanced production of sIL-6R was observed with short pulses of HIL-6 on CD133(+) 5-FU-pretreated cells. This overproduction of sIL-6R was abrogated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha protease inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of a disintegrin and metalloprotease proteases, suggesting the shedding of mIL-6R.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cells overexpressing hABCG1 were created in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells and characterized in terms of lipid composition. hABCG1 expressed in these cells formed homodimers and was mostly present intracellularly. Cholesterol efflux from hABCG1 cells to HDL2 and HDL3 was increased but not to lipid-free apolipoproteins. A range of phospholipid containing acceptors apart from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses were also efficient in mediating ABCG1-dependent export of cholesterol. Importantly, a buoyant phospholipid-containing fraction generated from incubation of lipid-free apoA-I with macrophages was nearly as efficient as HDL2. The capacity of acceptors to induce ABCG1-mediated efflux was strongly correlated with their total phospholipid content, suggesting that acceptor phospholipids drive ABCG1-mediated efflux. Most importantly, acceptors for ABCG1-mediated cholesterol export could be generated from incubation of cells with lipid-free apoA-I through the action of ABCA1 alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a synergistic relationship between ABCA1 and ABCG1 in peripheral tissues, where ABCA1 lipidates any lipid-poor/free apoA-I to generate nascent or pre-beta-HDL. These particles in turn may serve as substrates for ABCG1-mediated cholesterol export.","['Gelissen, Ingrid C', 'Harris, Matthew', 'Rye, Kerry-Anne', 'Quinn, Carmel', 'Brown, Andrew J', 'Kockx, Maaike', 'Cartland, Sian', 'Packianathan, Mathana', 'Kritharides, Leonard', 'Jessup, Wendy']","['Gelissen IC', 'Harris M', 'Rye KA', 'Quinn C', 'Brown AJ', 'Kockx M', 'Cartland S', 'Packianathan M', 'Kritharides L', 'Jessup W']","['Centre for Vascular Research, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apolipoprotein A-I/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Atherosclerosis/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholesterol/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cricetinae', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tritium']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.ATV.0000200082.58536.e1 [pii]', '10.1161/01.ATV.0000200082.58536.e1 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2006 Mar;26(3):534-40. doi: 10.1161/01.ATV.0000200082.58536.e1.

We have investigated the effect of viral and nonviral vectors on the phenotype and function of endothelial cells (ECs) and developed methods to block any activation caused by these vectors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transduction of ECs with viral vectors, including adenovirus, lentiviruses, and Moloney murine leukemia virus, can induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This activation was reduced when nonviral vectors were used. We demonstrate that after transduction there is upregulation of dsRNA-triggered antiviral and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blockade of the NFkappaB, PI3-K, or PKR signaling pathways all operated to inhibit partially virally induced activation, and inhibition of both PKR and PI3-K pathways totally blocked EC activation. Furthermore, inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta in addition to PI3-K was effective at preventing EC activation. CONCLUSIONS: Viral vectors, although efficient at transducing ECs, result in their activation. Blockade of the signaling pathways involved in viral activation may be used to prevent such activation.","['Tan, Peng H', 'Xue, Shao-An', 'Manunta, Maria', 'Beutelspacher, Sven C', 'Fazekasova, Henrieta', 'Alam, A K M Shamsul', 'McClure, Myra O', 'George, Andrew J T']","['Tan PH', 'Xue SA', 'Manunta M', 'Beutelspacher SC', 'Fazekasova H', 'Alam AK', 'McClure MO', 'George AJ']","['Division of Medicine, Department of Immunology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. ptan@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Saphenous Vein/cytology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vasculitis/*etiology/immunology/metabolism']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.ATV.0000200083.95349.9e [pii]', '10.1161/01.ATV.0000200083.95349.9e [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2006 Mar;26(3):462-7. doi: 10.1161/01.ATV.0000200083.95349.9e.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that NEFA may induce monocyte inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Monocytes exposed to NEFA for 2 days demonstrated a dose-related increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and adhesion to endothelial cells. All of these effects were inhibited by the coaddition of antioxidants such as glutathione or butylated hydroxytoluene, by inhibition of ROS generation by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, and by inhibition of protein kinase C, a recognized stimulator of NAPDH oxidase. Monocytes exposed to NEFA also demonstrated a significant increase in CD11b message expression. Stimulation of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells by NEFA was inhibited by addition of neutralizing antibodies to either CD11b or CD18. Finally, surface expression of CD11b increased significantly on monocytes as measured by flow cytometry, after their incubation with NEFA. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that elevated concentrations of NEFA may enhance integrin facilitated monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and these effects appear mediated, in part, through activation of NADPH oxidase and oxidative stress.","['Zhang, Wei-Yang', 'Schwartz, Eric', 'Wang, Yingjie', 'Attrep, Jeanne', 'Li, Zhi', 'Reaven, Peter']","['Zhang WY', 'Schwartz E', 'Wang Y', 'Attrep J', 'Li Z', 'Reaven P']","['Department of Medicine, Carl T.

Affinity of BGC 945 for the alpha-FR is 70% of the high-affinity ligand folic acid. In contrast to conventional antifolates, BGC 945 has low affinity for the widely expressed reduced-folate carrier (RFC). The K(i) for isolated thymidylate synthase is 1.2 nmol/L and the IC(50) for inhibition of the growth of alpha-FR-negative mouse L1210 or human A431 cells is approximately 7 micromol/L. In contrast, BGC 945 is highly potent in a range of alpha-FR-overexpressing human tumor cell lines (IC(50) approximately 1-300 nmol/L). Pharmacokinetic variables measured following i.v. injection of 100 mg/kg BGC 945 to KB tumor-bearing mice showed rapid plasma clearance (0.021 L/h) and tissue distribution. The terminal half-lives in plasma, liver, kidney, spleen, and tumor were 2, 0.6, 5, 21, and 28 hours, respectively. Tumor BGC 945 concentration at 24 hours was approximately 1 nmol/g tissue, at least 10-fold higher than that in plasma or normal tissues. Inhibition of thymidylate synthase in tissues leads to increased incorporation of 5-[(125)I]-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine ([(125)I]dUrd) into DNA. Forty-eight hours after injection of 100 mg/kg 6RS-BGC 945 ([(125)I]dUrd injected at 24 hours), tumor was the only tissue with incorporation above control level (6-fold). The RFC-mediated thymidylate synthase inhibitor plevitrexed also increased uptake of [(125)I]dUrd in tumor (10-fold) but, in contrast, also caused increased incorporation in other normal tissues such as spleen and small bowel (4.5- and 4.6-fold, respectively).

Both types of MLL fusion proteins enforce persistent expression of Hox a9 and Meis1, which is pivotal for leukemogenesis through mechanisms that remain obscure. Here, we show that nuclear and dimerizable forms of MLL bind with a similar pattern to the Hox a9 locus that overlaps the distribution of wild-type MLL and deregulate transcription of three isoforms of Hox a9. Induction of MLL fusion protein activity is associated with increased levels of histone acetylation and Lys(4) methylation at Hox target genes.

We have now synthesized mutant forms of TRAIL specific for TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2. The selectivity of these mutants to induce apoptosis in cell lines is due to selective binding to their cognate receptors resulting in apoptosis via formation of a death-inducing signaling complex. Using these mutants, we now unequivocally show that primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma signal to apoptosis almost exclusively through TRAIL-R1. Thus, no significant therapeutic benefit can be anticipated from treating such patients with agents currently in clinical trials that signal predominantly through TRAIL-R2, such as HGS-ETR2 or Apo2L/TRAIL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We therefore analyzed clinicopathological data from 257 consecutive and unrelated WM patients. Forty-eight (18.7%) patients had at least one first-degree relative with either WM (n = 13, 5.1%), or another B-cell disorder including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 9, 3.5%), myeloma (n = 8, 3.1%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 7, 2.7%), monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (n = 5, 1.9%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 3, 1.2%) and Hodgkin's disease (n = 3, 1.2%). Patients with a familial history of WM or a plasma cell disorder (PCD) were diagnosed at a younger age and with greater bone marrow involvement. RESULTS: Deletions in 6q represented the only recurrent structural chromosomal abnormality and were found in 13% of patients, all non-familial cases. Interphase FISH analysis demonstrated deletions in 6q21-22.1 in nearly half of patients, irrespective of familial background.

Here we studied the mechanism underlying the HCV fusion process in vitro using liposomes and our recently described HCV pseudoparticles (pp) bearing functional E1E2 envelope glycoproteins. The fusion of HCVpp with liposomes was monitored with fluorescent probes incorporated into either the HCVpp or the liposomes. To validate these assays, pseudoparticles bearing either the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus or the amphotropic glycoprotein of murine leukemia virus were used as models for pH-dependent and pH-independent entry, respectively. The use of assays based either on fusion-induced dequenching of fluorescent probes or on reporter systems, which produce fluorescence when the virus and liposome contents are mixed, allowed us to demonstrate that HCVpp mediated a complete fusion process, leading to the merging of both membrane leaflets and to the mixing of the internal contents of pseudoparticle and liposome. This HCVpp-mediated fusion was dependent on low pH, with a threshold of 6.3 and an optimum at about 5.5. Fusion was temperature-dependent and did not require any protein or receptor at the surface of the target liposomes. Most interestingly, fusion was facilitated by the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane. These findings clearly indicate that HCV infection is mediated by a pH-dependent membrane fusion process. This paves the way for future studies of the mechanisms underlying HCV membrane fusion.","['Lavillette, Dimitri', 'Bartosch, Birke', 'Nourrisson, Delphine', 'Verney, Geraldine', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic', 'Penin, Francois', 'Pecheur, Eve-Isabelle']","['Lavillette D', 'Bartosch B', 'Nourrisson D', 'Verney G', 'Cosset FL', 'Penin F', 'Pecheur EI']","['IFR128 Biosciences Lyon Gerland, Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Proteines, UMR 5086 CNRS-Universite Claude Bernard de Lyon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cholesterol/physiology', 'Hepacivirus/*physiology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Liposomes', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Temperature', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology', 'Virion/physiology']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)48369-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M509747200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Feb 17;281(7):3909-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M509747200.

Here, we have examined the action of both nisin and magainin on human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Cells were cultured in presence of either nisin or magainin 1 as well as in combination with both nisin and magainin 1. Results have revealed that magainin, but not nisin, produces a loss of cell viability in HL-60 cells, and a minor increase of hemolysis, whereas it is not responsible for cell membrane disruption and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. In addition, magainin is involved in a significant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as in an augment of caspase-3 activity. Magainin-induced apoptosis was verified by DNA fragmentation and annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining of the cells. Promotion of cell death by magainin occurs via cytochrome c release accompanied by a substantial increase of proteasome activity. These results underline the importance of magainin as a drug capable of exerting an in vitro antitumoral activity by triggering apoptosis.","['Cruz-Chamorro, Lidia', 'Puertollano, Maria A', 'Puertollano, Elena', 'de Cienfuegos, Gerardo Alvarez', 'de Pablo, Manuel A']","['Cruz-Chamorro L', 'Puertollano MA', 'Puertollano E', 'de Cienfuegos GA', 'de Pablo MA']","['Unit of Microbiology, Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Experimental Sciences, University of Jaen, E-23071 Jaen, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Peptides,Peptides,8008690,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Nisin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0196-9781(05)00551-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.peptides.2005.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Peptides. 2006 Jun;27(6):1201-9. doi: 10.1016/j.peptides.2005.11.008.

SAA and CRP were analyzed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, and Hp and Cp were measured using colorimetric methods, all previously validated for use in dogs. Increased concentrations of all APPs were observed in all groups of diseased dogs, but statistical significance only was observed with Hp (I, P < .001; HT, P < .05), Cp (I, P < .05; AIHA, P < .01), and CRP (I, P < .001; HT, P < .001; AIHA, CRP P < .05). High variability in individual APPs within each group of diseases was found with no significant differences between leukemia and lymphoma as well as among different types of neoplasia. The AIHA group had smaller increases in Hp, SAA, and CRP but higher concentrations of Cp. When follow-up of individual cases was possible, a decrease in APPs generally was found in cases with favorable outcome. The results of this study suggest that neoplasia and hematologic diseases such as AIHA should be considered as possible causes of mild increases in APPs in dogs. Measurement of APPs may be helpful to assess clinical evolution and monitor treatment of these processes.","['Tecles, F', 'Spiranelli, E', 'Bonfanti, U', 'Ceron, J J', 'Paltrinieri, S']","['Tecles F', 'Spiranelli E', 'Bonfanti U', 'Ceron JJ', 'Paltrinieri S']","['Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Murcia, 30100 Espinardo, Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*analysis', 'Animals', 'Dog Diseases/*blood', 'Dogs', 'Hematologic Diseases/*blood/*veterinary', 'Neoplasms/*blood/*veterinary']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/02/02 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1892/0891-6640(2005)19[865:psosap]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2005 Nov-Dec;19(6):865-70. doi: 10.1892/0891-6640(2005)19[865:psosap]2.0.co;2.,,['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, reports of examinations of bone marrow from cats, submitted over an 8-year period, were reviewed to identify cats with increased numbers of small lymphocytes. Of 203 reports reviewed, 12 (5.9%) indicated increased numbers of small lymphocytes. Diagnoses for these cats included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 2), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA; n = 4), immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA; n = 3), thymoma (n = 1), cholangiohepatitis (n = 1), and fever of unknown origin (n = 1). Several factors were identified that could be used to differentiate reactive lymphocytosis from CLL. Cats with CLL tended to be older, and lymphocytes were slightly larger and had cleaved or lobulated nuclei. Reactive lymphocytosis was associated with immune-mediated anemias and inflammatory diseases. In reactive lymphocytosis, the proliferating lymphocytes were organized into lymphoid aggregates in bone marrow and were predominately B cells. Alternatively, in CLL and thymoma, the proliferating lymphocytes were diffusely distributed and were predominately T cells. Therefore, differentiation of the causes of lymphocytosis should include evaluation of signalment, concurrent disease conditions, lymphocyte morphology, lymphocyte distribution in bone marrow, and immunophenotype. Cat age, presence of severe anemia, and evidence of inflammatory disease also should be considered.","['Weiss, Douglas J']",['Weiss DJ'],"['Department of Veterinary Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, 1971 Commonwealth Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA. weiss005@umn.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Anemia/immunology/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cats', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Hepatitis, Animal/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology/*veterinary', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thymoma/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary']",,2005/12/17 09:00,2006/02/02 09:00,['2005/12/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1892/0891-6640(2005)19[855:dbamco]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2005 Nov-Dec;19(6):855-9. doi: 10.1892/0891-6640(2005)19[855:dbamco]2.0.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite compatibility tests before transfusion (determination of the ABO and Rhesus blood groups and detection of clinically relevant antibodies (C, c, D, E, e, Fy(a), Fy(b), Jk(a), Jk(b), M, S and s)), transfusion reactions can occur. So that a transfusion reaction can be recognised in time, the patient must be observed intensively for the first 5-10 minutes after the start of any new transfusion and the vital functions must be recorded. In patients with a Hb level of 4-6 mmol/l, the decision whether or not to transfuse should be made dependent on the patient's other characteristics. Thrombocyte transfusion is not indicated in case of thrombopenia due to increased breakdown or pooling. If leukaemia, tumour infiltration or drug toxicity is the underlying cause of thrombopenia, then a platelet count of 10 x 10(9)/l or 20 x 10(9)/l should be the transfusion trigger. Reduction of the number of blood transfusions can be achieved by the administration of epoetin in case of renal insufficiency: transfusion can thus be avoided in more than 70% of the patients concerned.

Unsupervised analyses revealed segregation according to lineages and primary genetic changes, i.e., TCF3(E2A)/PBX1, IGH@/MYC, ETV6(TEL)/RUNX1(AML1), 11q23/MLL, and hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes). Supervised discriminatory analyses were used to identify differentially expressed genes correlating with lineage and primary genetic change. The gene-expression profiles of normal hematopoietic cells were also studied. By using principal component analyses (PCA), a differentiation axis was exposed, reflecting lineages and maturation stages of normal hematopoietic cells. By applying the three principal components obtained from PCA of the normal cells on the leukemic samples, similarities between malignant and normal cell lineages and maturations were investigated. Apart from showing that leukemias segregate according to lineage and genetic subtype, we provide an extensive study of the genes correlating with primary genetic changes. We also investigated the expression pattern of these genes in normal hematopoietic cells of different lineages and maturations, identifying genes preferentially expressed by the leukemic cells, suggesting an ectopic activation of a large number of genes, likely to reflect regulatory networks of pathogenetic importance that also may provide attractive targets for future directed therapies.","['Andersson, Anna', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Lindgren, David', 'Nilsson, Bjorn', 'Ritz, Cecilia', 'Eden, Patrik', 'Lassen, Carin', 'Rade, Johan', 'Fontes, Magnus', 'Morse, Helena', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Hoglund, Mattias', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Andersson A', 'Olofsson T', 'Lindgren D', 'Nilsson B', 'Ritz C', 'Eden P', 'Lassen C', 'Rade J', 'Fontes M', 'Morse H', 'Heldrup J', 'Behrendtz M', 'Mitelman F', 'Hoglund M', 'Johansson B', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden. anna.andersson@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Hematopoietic System/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry']",,2005/12/16 09:00,2006/02/07 09:00,['2005/12/16 09:00'],"['2005/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0506637102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0506637102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Dec 27;102(52):19069-74. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0506637102.

In addition, a portion of agonist-induced contraction is partially mediated by the Ca2+-independent activation of the small G protein RhoA and a downstream target, Rho-kinase. The activation of RhoA is controlled by several regulatory proteins, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs activate RhoA by promoting the release of GDP and then facilitating the binding of GTP. There are three Rho-specific GEFs (RhoGEFs) in vascular smooth muscle that contain a binding domain [regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain] capable of linking GPCRs to RhoA activation: PDZ-RhoGEF, leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), and p115RhoGEF. We hypothesized that RGS domain-containing RhoGEFs, especially LARG, participate in linking GPCR to RhoA activation in vascular smooth muscle. We observed that angiotensin II up-regulates LARG via the AT1 receptor, and this up-regulation is signaled via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Furthermore, angiotensin II treatment caused a small, but significant, increase in the component of contractile responses sensitive to Rho-kinase antagonism. These observations support the hypothesis that RhoGEFs, particularly LARG, participate in linking GPCR to RhoA activation in vascular smooth muscle.","['Ying, Zhekang', 'Jin, Liming', 'Palmer, Trenis', 'Webb, R Clinton']","['Ying Z', 'Jin L', 'Palmer T', 'Webb RC']","['Department of Physiology, Medical College of Georgia, 1120 Fifteenth St., CA3099, Augusta, GA 30912-3000, USA. zyinggs@students.mcg.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Angiotensin II/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1/*agonists/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vasodilation/drug effects', 'rho-Associated Kinases']",,2005/12/16 09:00,2006/04/20 09:00,['2005/12/16 09:00'],"['2005/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.105.017830 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.105.017830 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2006 Mar;69(3):932-40. doi: 10.1124/mol.105.017830.

In the present study, we identified mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade-mediated histone H3 ser10 phosphorylation to be a molecular link between proliferation and induction of hTERT/telomerase activity. In normal human T lymphocytes and fibroblasts, growth or stress stimuli known to drive H3 phosphorylation through the MAPK signaling induce hTERT expression and/or telomerase activity that was preceded by phosphorylated histone H3 (ser10) at the hTERT promoter. Blockade of the MAPK-triggered H3 phosphorylation significantly abrogates hTERT induction and ser10 phosphorylation at this promoter. However, H3 ser10 phosphorylation alone resulted in low, transient hTERT induction, as seen in fibroblasts, whereas H3 phosphorylation followed by its acetylation at lys14 robustly trans-activated the hTERT gene accompanying constitutive telomerase activity in normal and malignant T cells. H3 acetylation without phosphorylation similarly exerted weak effects on hTERT expression. These results define H3 phosphorylation as a key to hTERT transactivation induced by proliferation and reveal a fundamental mechanism for telomerase regulation in both normal human cells and transformed T cells.","['Ge, Zheng', 'Liu, Cheng', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Gruber, Astrid', 'Xu, Dawei']","['Ge Z', 'Liu C', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Gruber A', 'Xu D']","['Division of Hematology, Deaprtment of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation']",,2005/12/16 09:00,2006/03/30 09:00,['2005/12/16 09:00'],"['2005/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/1/230 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.26.1.230-237.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Jan;26(1):230-7. doi: 10.1128/MCB.26.1.230-237.2006.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,PMC1317632,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, tumor load and hypermetabolism may induce malnutrition. We determined whether serum levels of sTNF-RII and IL-1ra are upregulated to prevent overt malnutrition and whether tumor load and hypermetabolism induce overt malnutrition. METHODS: We examined 31 children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and correlated sTNF-RII, IL-1ra, tumor load and energy expenditure to anthropometric characteristics (weight, weight for height, height, body mass index, fat free mass) and serum protein concentrations (albumin, transferrin, prealbumin). As controls, 68 healthy children were examined for anthropometric characteristics; 33 healthy controls were included for cytokine analysis and biochemical indices. RESULTS: We found no correlations between sTNF-RII, IL-1ra, tumor load and energy expenditure and anthropometric characteristics or protein concentrations. Mean sTNF-RII level was significantly, mean IL-1ra level slightly increased (223% and 113% of the controls). 29% of the children had a high tumor load (> 100.000/microl white blood cells) and 53% had hypermetabolism (resting energy expenditure > 110% of predicted). Anthropometric characteristics were similar to those in controls, however, serum protein concentrations were decreased. CONCLUSION: sTNF-RII and IL-1ra are upregulated in children with leukemia and may therefore prevent overt malnutrition. Tumor load and hypermetabolism do not induce overt malnutrition. The children presented with an early stage of malnutrition as evidenced by low serum protein concentrations but normal anthropometric characteristics.","['Schmid, I', 'Schmitt, M', 'Streiter, M', 'Meilbeck, R', 'Haas, R J', 'Stachel, D K']","['Schmid I', 'Schmitt M', 'Streiter M', 'Meilbeck R', 'Haas RJ', 'Stachel DK']","['Kinderklinik and Kinderpoliklinik im Dr. von Haunerschen Kinderspital, University of Munich, Lindwurmstrasse 4, D-80337 Munich, Germany.

Interference, or superinfection resistance, is a frequent consequence of retroviral infection, and occurs when newly-synthesized Env binds to receptor proteins resulting in a block to entry by retroviruses that use the same receptors. Three groups of viruses demonstrate a non-reciprocal pattern of interference (NRI), which requires the existence of both a common receptor utilized by all viruses within the group, and a specific receptor that is used by a subset of viruses. In the case of amphotropic and 10A1 murine leukemia viruses (MLV), the common and specific receptors are the products of two related genes. In the case of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus types B, D, and E, the two receptors are distinct protein products of a single gene. NRI also occurs between xenotropic and polytropic MLV. The common receptor, Xpr1, has been identified, but a specific receptor has yet to be described. RESULTS: Using chimeric receptor proteins and interference studies, we have identified a region of Xpr1 that is uniquely utilized by xenotropic MLV and show that this receptor domain is required for non-reciprocal interference. CONCLUSION: We propose a novel pattern of receptor usage by xenotropic and polytropic MLV to explain the NRI observed between these viruses. We propose that the specific and common receptor determinants for xenotropic and polytropic viruses are simultaneously present in discreet domains of a single Xpr1 protein.","['Van Hoeven, Neal S', 'Miller, A Dusty']","['Van Hoeven NS', 'Miller AD']","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA. nvanhoeven@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Viral Interference', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",,2005/12/16 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/12/16 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-76 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-76 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 Dec 15;2:76. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-76.,"['P30 DK047754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL054881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",,,PMC1325250,,,20051215,,,,,,,,,

The expression of hTERT, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, plays a crucial role in the control of lymphocyte proliferation by maintaining telomere homeostasis. It has been previously found that hTERT activity is down-regulated by the human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein in HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocytes. In this study, we have examined the effects of Tax expression on the transcriptional profile of telomerase and of shelterin in human T lymphocytes. RESULTS: We first provide evidence that the up-regulation of hTERT transcription in activated CD4+ T lymphocytes is associated with a down-regulation of that of TERF1, TERF2 and POT1 genes. Next, the down-regulation of hTERT transcription by Tax in HTLV-1 transformed or in Tax-expressing T lymphocytes is found to correlate with a significant increase of TRF2 and/or Pot1 mRNAs. Finally, ectopic expression of hTERT in one HTLV-1 T cell line induces a marked decrease in the transcription of the POT1 gene. Collectively, these observations predict that the increased transcriptional expression of shelterin genes is minimizing the impact on telomere instability induced by the down-regulation of hTERT by Tax. CONCLUSION: These findings support the notion that Tax, telomerase and shelterin play a critical role in the proliferation of HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocytes.","['Escoffier, Emmanuelle', 'Rezza, Amelie', 'Roborel de Climens, Aude', 'Belleville, Aurelie', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Gilson, Eric', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine']","['Escoffier E', 'Rezza A', 'Roborel de Climens A', 'Belleville A', 'Gazzolo L', 'Gilson E', 'Duc Dodon M']","[""Virologie Humaine INSERM-U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, IFR 128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, 46 Allee d'Italie, 69364, Lyon Cedex 07, France. emmanuelle.escoffier@wanadoo.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Shelterin Complex', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/*genetics', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2005/12/16 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2005/12/16 09:00'],"['2005/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-77 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-77 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 Dec 15;2:77. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-77.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (POT1 protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,PMC1343578,,,20051215,,,,,,,,,

All available clinical trial experience from the caspofungin development program was reviewed to ascertain the efficacy of caspofungin in neutropenic patients with documented invasive aspergillosis (IA) or invasive candidiasis (IC). METHODS: The review was limited to neutropenic patients with proven IC or proven/probable IA at caspofungin onset. Data were available from four clinical trials. All patients had an absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm(3) at the initiation of caspofungin. In all cases caspofungin was administered as monotherapy at a dose of 50 mg/day, after a 70-mg loading dose. In all patients efficacy was assessed at the completion of caspofungin therapy. Success included complete and partial responses. RESULTS: Sixty-eight neutropenic patients were identified with documented invasive infection, including 27 with IC and 41 with IA. Most patients had acute or chronic leukemia. A favorable response was noted in 63% (17 of 27 patients) of patients with IC, including a 58% (14 of 24 patients) response as first-line therapy and a 100% (3 of 3 patients) response as salvage therapy. Success in candidemia was 68% (17 of 25 patients). Outcomes across the different Candida species were similar. Favorable responses were noted in 39% (16 of 41 patients) of patients with IA, including a 42% (5 of 12 patients) response as first-line therapy and 38% (11 of 29 patients) response as salvage therapy. Success by site of IA was 40% for pulmonary (12 of 30 patients), 43% for sinus (3 of 7 patients), and 25% for skin/disseminated site (1 of 4 patients).

Debate continues about the impact of treatment on survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Purine analogues are the most active agents for treatment of patients with CLL. Recently, it was shown that a chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining fludarabine (F), cyclophosphamide (C), and rituximab (R) (FCR) was very effective in treating patients with recurrent and/or refractory CLL. The objective of the current analysis was to determine whether improvements in treatment have had an impact on survival for patients with CLL. METHODS: Three nonoverlapping, sequential groups of patients enrolled on Phase II studies who received treatment with F (n = 251 patients), FC (n = 111 patients), or FCR (n = 143 patients) were analyzed. Pretreatment characteristics, responses to treatment, and overall survival were compared. RESULTS: Patients who were treated with FCR had a higher complete remission rate compared with patients who were treated with combined F and C or with F alone. Statistically significantly longer estimated median survival was noted for patients who received FCR. A Cox proportional hazards, multivariable model for overall survival that included all patients (n = 505) showed that patients who received FCR had longer survival (P < 0.0001) after adjusting for other significant (P < 0.05) pretreatment characteristics, including age, hemoglobin, beta-2 microglobulin, and the number of prior treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective comparison of patients with recurrent and refractory CLL indicated a higher complete remission rate and the longest estimated survival for patients who were treated with FCR, providing the basis for randomized clinical trials of this regimen.","['Wierda, William', ""O'brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Giles, Francis', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael']","['Wierda W', ""O'brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wang X', 'Do KA', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Thomas D', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Giles F', 'Lerner S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

It has been recently described as a receptor for HHV-6. Also, it has been shown to be highly expressed on malignant cells as compared to normal cells, thus playing a major role by which these cells, either cells of haematological malignancy or cells of other body cancers, can protect themselves against complement attack so they can survive and metastasize. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study has been done to detect the seroprevalence of HHV-6 among 47 Egyptian adult cases of acute leukemia using the anti-HHV-6 IgG ELISA serological technique. CD46 receptor expression and immunophenotyping technique were performed using FCM. Twenty nine of the cases were ANLL, while 18 were ALL cases. Sixteen age- and sex-matched control cases were also studied for both anti-HHV-6 IgG and CD46 receptor expression. RESULTS: HHV-6 IgG antibodies were encountered in 29 (100%), 14 (77.8%) and 12 (75%) of the ANLL, ALL and the control group, cases, respectively. CD46 expression was encountered in 21 (72.4%) of the ANLL cases and in 10 (55.6%) of the ALL cases. Concordance between HHV- 6 seropositivity and CD46 expression was encountered in 31 cases (29 positive and 2 negative). Disconcordance was encountered in 16 cases with 14 showing HHV-6 IgG seropositivity with no CD46 expression and 2 showing the reverse. CONCLUSION: The lack of significant correlation between CD46 expression and seropositivity would exclude CD46 expression as a cause of contracting HHV-6 infection in leukemic patients.","['Assem, Magda M', 'Gad, Walaa H', 'El-Sharkawy, Nahla M', 'El-Rouby, Mahmoud N', 'Ghaleb, Fayek M', 'Tarek, Hala', 'Kamel, Azza M']","['Assem MM', 'Gad WH', 'El-Sharkawy NM', 'El-Rouby MN', 'Ghaleb FM', 'Tarek H', 'Kamel AM']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', 'Leukemia/*virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",,2005/12/15 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2005/12/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2005 Mar;17(1):29-34.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are approximately 100 immunophenotyped cases of PBLL; reported in the literature; most as single case reports or very small series. In this report, we describe patterns of presentation, and results of a retrospective study looking at patients with PBLL treated at KFSH and RC between 1993 and 2000. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present results of a retrospective study looking at patients with PBLL treated at KFSHRC between 1993 and 2000, younger than 14 years of age (cut-off age for pediatric department). Six cases of PBLL were lacking evidence of blood and bone marrow involvement. Histologic sections were available for review in all cases. RESULTS: Twenty one patients were treated for lymphoblastic lymphoma, of which six had a precursor Bcell phenotype. There were three boys and the median age at diagnosis was 6 years (range 3-13). In four of the patients the primary involved were oro-nasopharynx or the paranasal sinuses. One patient had a soft tissue mass in the upper thigh while one patient had a solitary bone lesion in the distal tibia. Four of the patients had limited stage disease (2 stage I and stage II), while 2 were stage IV. Both patients with stage IV disease had CNS involvement with blasts in the CSF. Both had paranasal primaries and had bone infiltration involving the base of the skull, with radiological documentation of intracranial extension in one patient. Median LDH level was 542 IU/L (range 463-5000). Five patients were treated according to B-cell NHL type protocols. Because of the specific diagnosis of PBLL, two of these patients were switched to an ALL-type protocol following post induction intensification; one died in remission due to encephalitis, while the other remained in CR almost 2 years after diagnosis. A third patient suffered a loco-regional relapse 17 months after completing first line therapy, and was re-treated on an ALL-type protocol, and currently is in remission 25 months following relapse. The fourth patient, who received 9 months of post induction therapy, remains free of disease 7 years following diagnosis. The fifth patient had local and CNS progression on therapy, and died of his disease. The last patient with a solitary bone lesion was misdiagnosed as Ewings' Sarcoma and received treatment for that disease. He suffered an isolated CNS relapse, and is in CR 12 months following the relapse, on an ALL treatment protocol. CONCLUSION: PBLL is a distinct B-cell NHL which involves extralymphatic sites, with particular predisposition for the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients should not be treated on short intensive protocols used for other B-cell NHL but should receive treatment based on ALL protocols like those for treating T-cell LL.","['Belgaumi, Asim F', 'Al-Kofide, Amani', 'Sabbah, Rajeh', 'Shalaby, Lobna']","['Belgaumi AF', 'Al-Kofide A', 'Sabbah R', 'Shalaby L']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Research Centre and King Fahd National Centre for Childrens Cancer and Research, Riyadh, KSA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/12/15 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2005/12/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2005 Mar;17(1):15-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA-induced activation was mediated by a region in the PU.1 promoter to which CEBPB and OCT-1 binding were induced. Finally, conditional expression of PU.1 in human APL cells was sufficient to trigger neutrophil differentiation, whereas reduction of PU.1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation.

There is limited long-term outcome data with single-agent As2O3 in the management of newly diagnosed cases of APL. Between January 1998 to December 2004, 72 newly diagnosed cases of APL were treated with a regimen of single-agent As2O3 at our center. Complete hematologic remission was achieved in 86.1%. At a median follow-up of 25 months (range: 8-92 months), the 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of EFS, DFS, and OS was 74.87% +/- 5.6%, 87.21% +/- 4.93%, and 86.11% +/- 4.08%, respectively. Patients presenting with a white blood cell (WBC) count lower than 5 x 10(9)/L and a platelet count higher than 20 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis (n = 22 [30.6%]) have an excellent prognosis with this regimen (EFS, OS, and DFS of 100%).

While adoptive transfer of donor-derived tumor-specific T cells is a conceptually attractive approach to eliminating residual disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, adoptive immunotherapy after UCBT is constrained by the difficulty of generating antigen-specific T cells from functionally naive umbilical cord-blood (UCB)-derived T cells. Therefore, to generate T cells that recognize B-ALL, we have developed a chimeric immunoreceptor to redirect the specificity of T cells for CD19, a B-lineage antigen, and expressed this transgene in UCB-derived T cells. An ex vivo process, which is compliant with current good manufacturing practice for T-cell trials, has been developed to genetically modify and numerically expand UCB-derived T cells into CD19-specific effector cells. These are capable of CD19-restricted cytokine production and cytolysis in vitro, as well as mediating regression of CD19+ tumor and being selectively eliminated in vivo. Moreover, time-lapse microscopy of the genetically modified T-cell clones revealed an ability to lyse CD19+ tumor cells specifically and repetitively. These data provide the rationale for infusing UCB-derived CD19-specific T cells after UCBT to reduce the incidence of CD19+ B-ALL relapse.","['Serrano, Lisa Marie', 'Pfeiffer, Timothy', 'Olivares, Simon', 'Numbenjapon, Tontanai', 'Bennitt, Jennifer', 'Kim, Daniel', 'Smith, David', 'McNamara, George', 'Al-Kadhimi, Zaid', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Jensen, Michael C', 'Cooper, Laurence J N']","['Serrano LM', 'Pfeiffer T', 'Olivares S', 'Numbenjapon T', 'Bennitt J', 'Kim D', 'Smith D', 'McNamara G', 'Al-Kadhimi Z', 'Rosenthal J', 'Forman SJ', 'Jensen MC', 'Cooper LJ']","['University of Texas M.

To better understand potential mechanisms of action, we have studied effects of the FTI tipifarnib on inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. In a human leukemia cell line THP-1, tipifarnib inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription of chemokines [monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and MCP-2], cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and interferon (IFN)beta], signaling molecules (MyD88 and STAT-1), proteases [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9)], and receptors (urokinase receptor). Tipifarnib also inhibited LPS-induced secretion of MMP-9, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1beta in THP-1 cells. In primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1beta by tipifarnib was observed with no evidence of cytotoxicity. Similar results were obtained in vivo in a murine model of LPS-induced inflammation, where pretreatment with tipifarnib resulted in significant inhibition of TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-1beta, and MIP-1alpha production. Tipifarnib had no effect in vitro or in vivo on LPS-induced IL-8. Studies in THP-1 cells to address potential mechanism(s) showed that tipifarnib partially inhibited LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation. Tipifarnib significantly inhibited inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (IkappaB)-alpha degradation and p65 nuclear translocation induced by LPS, but not by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1alpha, or toll-like receptor (TLR)2 ligand, suggesting that the target for inhibition of NF-kappaB activation was exclusive to the LPS/TLR4 signal pathway. The extent of IkappaB-alpha degradation inhibition did not correlate with inhibition of Ras farnesylation, indicating that Ras was not the target for the observed anti-inflammatory activity of tipifarnib. Our findings differ from those for other FTIs, which may have relevance for their dissimilar activity in specific tumor repertoires.","['Xue, Xiaohua', 'Lai, Kuei-Tai A', 'Huang, Jing-Feng', 'Gu, Yin', 'Karlsson, Lars', 'Fourie, Anne']","['Xue X', 'Lai KT', 'Huang JF', 'Gu Y', 'Karlsson L', 'Fourie A']","['Alza/Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development-La Jolla, San Diego, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2005/12/15 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2005/12/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.105.095976 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.105.095976 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2006 Apr;317(1):53-60. doi: 10.1124/jpet.105.095976.

We previously showed that a single immunization with an env gene-encoded CD4+ T cell epitope protected mice against fatal Friend retrovirus infection. Here, we analyzed immune cell components required for the peptide-induced anti-retroviral protection. Mice lacking CD8+ T cells were nevertheless protected against Friend virus infection, while mice lacking B cells were not. Virus-producing cells both in the spleen and bone marrow decreased rapidly in their number and became undetectable by 4 weeks after infection in the majority of the peptide-immunized animals even in the absence of CD8+ T cells. In the vaccinated animals the production and class switching of virus-neutralizing and anti-leukemia cell antibodies were facilitated; however, virus-induced erythroid cell expansion was suppressed before neutralizing antibodies became detectable in the serum. Further, the numbers of virus-producing cells in the spleen and bone marrow in the early stage of the infection were smaller in the peptide-immunized than in unimmunized control mice in the absence of B cells. Thus, peptide immunization facilitates both early cellular and late humoral immune responses that lead to the effective control of the retrovirus-induced disease, but CD8+ T cells are not crucial for the elimination of virus-infected cells in the peptide-primed animals.","['Kawabata, Hiroyuki', 'Niwa, Atsuko', 'Tsuji-Kawahara, Sachiyo', 'Uenishi, Hirohide', 'Iwanami, Norimasa', 'Matsukuma, Hideaki', 'Abe, Hiroyuki', 'Tabata, Nobutada', 'Matsumura, Haruo', 'Miyazawa, Masaaki']","['Kawabata H', 'Niwa A', 'Tsuji-Kawahara S', 'Uenishi H', 'Iwanami N', 'Matsukuma H', 'Abe H', 'Tabata N', 'Matsumura H', 'Miyazawa M']","['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine, 377-2 Ohno-Higashi, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka 589-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/virology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Spleen/immunology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', '*Vaccination/methods', 'Viral Vaccines/*administration & dosage/immunology']",,2005/12/15 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2005/12/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['dxh361 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxh361 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2006 Jan;18(1):183-98. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxh361.

Two nonstructural proteins, NS3 and NS3A, have been implicated in this process. Here we show that both proteins bind to human Tsg101 and its ortholog from Drosophila melanogaster with similar strengths in vitro. This interaction is mediated by a conserved PSAP motif in NS3 and appears to play a role in virus release. The depletion of Tsg101 with small interfering RNA inhibits the release of BTV and African horse sickness virus, a related orbivirus, from HeLa cells up to fivefold and threefold, respectively. Like most other viral proteins which recruit Tsg101, NS3 also harbors a PPXY late-domain motif that allows NS3 to bind NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligases in vitro. However, the late-domain motifs in NS3 do not function as effectively in facilitating the release of mini Gag virus-like particles from 293T cells as the late domains from human immunodeficiency virus type 1, human T-cell leukemia virus, and Ebola virus. A mutagenesis study showed that the arginine residue in the PPRY motif is responsible for the low activity of the NS3 late-domain motifs. Our data suggest that the BTV late-domain motifs either recruit an antagonist that interferes with budding or fail to recruit an agonist which is different from NEDD4.","['Wirblich, Christoph', 'Bhattacharya, Bishnupriya', 'Roy, Polly']","['Wirblich C', 'Bhattacharya B', 'Roy P']","['Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Bluetongue virus/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*physiology', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Virus Assembly']",,2005/12/15 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2005/12/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/1/460 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.1.460-473.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jan;80(1):460-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.1.460-473.2006.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)', '0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)']",,,PMC1317520,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of CA and a tagged SUMO-1 protein resulted in covalent transfer of SUMO-1 to CA in vivo. Mutations of lysine residues to arginines near the Ubc9 binding site and mutations at the PIASy binding site reduced or eliminated CA SUMOylation. Introduction of these mutations into the complete viral genome blocked virus replication. The mutants exhibited no defects in the late stages of viral gene expression or virion assembly. Upon infection, the mutant viruses were able to carry out reverse transcription to synthesize normal levels of linear viral DNA but were unable to produce the circular viral DNAs or integrated provirus normally found in the nucleus.

Studies of the tropism of this virus have been hindered by the lack of an efficient system for viral replication in tissue culture. To map regulatory regions important for transcriptional activation, an in vivo footprinting method that couples dimethyl sulfate treatment and ligation-mediated PCR was performed in murine type II pneumocyte-derived MLE-15 cells infected with a chimeric Moloney murine leukemia virus driven by the JSRV enhancers (DeltaMo+JS Mo-MuLV). In vivo footprints were found in the JSRV enhancers in two regions previously shown to be important for JSRV long terminal repeat (LTR) activity: a binding site for the lung-specific transcription factor HNF-3beta and an E-box element in the distal enhancer adjacent to an NF-kappaB-like binding site. In addition, in vivo footprints were detected in two downstream motifs likely to bind C/EBP and NF-I. Mutational analysis of a JSRV LTR reporter construct (pJS21luc) revealed that the C/EBP binding site is critical for LTR activity, while the putative NF-I binding element is less important; elimination of these sites resulted in 70% and 40% drops in LTR activity, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from MLE-15 murine Clara cell-derived mtCC1-2 cells with probes corresponding to the NF-I or C/EBP sites revealed several complexes. Antiserum directed against NF-IA, C/EBPalpha, or C/EBPbeta supershifted the corresponding protein-DNA complexes, indicating that these isoforms, which are also important for the expression of several cellular lung-specific genes, may be important for JSRV expression in lung epithelial cells.","['McGee-Estrada, Kathleen', 'Fan, Hung']","['McGee-Estrada K', 'Fan H']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta', 'Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lung/cytology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Adenomatosis, Ovine/virology', 'Sheep', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2005/12/15 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2005/12/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/1/332 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.1.332-341.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jan;80(1):332-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.1.332-341.2006.,"['T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA82654/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32A09054/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135845-92-0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta)']",,,PMC1317537,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides the structural and enzymatic proteins, HTLV encodes regulatory (Tax and Rex) and accessory (open reading frame I [ORF I] and ORF II) proteins. Tax activates viral and cellular transcription and promotes T-cell growth and malignant transformation. Rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate cytoplasmic expression of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs. Recently, we reported that the accessory gene products of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 ORF II (p30II and p28II, respectively) are able to restrict viral replication. These proteins act as negative regulators of both Tax and Rex by binding to and retaining their mRNA in the nucleus, leading to reduced protein expression and virion production. Here, we show that p28II is recruited to the viral promoter in a Tax-dependent manner. After recruitment to the promoter, p28II or p30II then travels with the transcription elongation machinery until its target mRNA is synthesized. Experiments artificially directing these proteins to the promoter indicate that p28II, unlike HTLV-1 p30II, displays no transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the tethering of p28II directly to tax/rex mRNA resulted in repression of Tax function, which could be attributed to the ability of p28II to block TAP/p15-mediated enhancement of Tax expression. p28II-mediated reduction of viral replication in infected cells may permit survival of the cells by allowing escape from immune recognition, which is consistent with the critical role of HTLV accessory proteins in viral persistence in vivo.","['Younis, Ihab', 'Boris-Lawrie, Kathleen', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Younis I', 'Boris-Lawrie K', 'Green PL']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Rd., Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Open Reading Frames', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",,2005/12/15 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2005/12/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/1/181 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.1.181-191.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jan;80(1):181-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.1.181-191.2006.,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",,,PMC1317543,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was carried out to investigate the effects of caffeine on camptothecin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoints of leukemia cell line Molt-4. METHODS: The cell apoptosis was induced by camptothecin, and caffeine was used to interfere with cell cycle checkpoints. The apoptosis rate and cell cycle during apoptosis were analyzed using sub-G1 method and Annexin V-propidium iodide (Annexin V/PI) staining. RESULTS: Caffeine (2.0-20.0 mmon/L) had no effect on proliferation of Molt-4 cells in exponentially growth phase. Camptothecin selectively induced apoptosis of Molt-4 cells in S phase; when induced with camptothecin (0.15 micromol/L) for 4 or 6 h, the apoptosis rates were (23.69+/-2.26)% and (36.99+/-1.42)%. This cell cycle-specific apoptosis were inhibited obviously by caffeine with the apoptosis rates of (4.79+/-0.64)% and (2.69+/-0.56)%. When caffeine was removed, the apoptosis rates increased obviously to (46.23+/-0.21)% and (55.81+/-0.41)%, and still mainly happened in S phase. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine could inhibit camptothecin-induced apoptosis of Molt-4 cells. As a drug acting on cell cycle checkpoints, caffeine could transiently shield the surveillance of checkpoints to damaged cells and inhibit cell apoptosis. The effect may be reversed when caffeine is removed away.","['Tan, Hui-Ling', 'Feng, Yong-Dong', 'Tao, De-Ding', 'Xiao, Hui', 'Xie, Da-Xing', 'Yu, Cong-Nian', 'Gong, Jian-Ping']","['Tan HL', 'Feng YD', 'Tao DD', 'Xiao H', 'Xie DX', 'Yu CN', 'Gong JP']","['Molecular Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, P.

So far, the structure and function of terrestrial snake PLA(2), especially the relationship of its enzymatic and pharmacologic activities have been studied extensively, but the investigation of sea snake PLA(2) are limited. This study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of recombinant sea snake basic PLA(2) (rSSBPLA(2)) and its mutants rN48 and rK4 from sea snake Lapemis hardwickii venom, and to explore the influence of 2 residues related with the enzymatic activity on the antitumor effects. METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis of the 2 conserved residues related with enzymatic activity (His48 mutated to Asn and Asp49 mutated to Lys) was performed. The inhibitory effects of rSSBPLA(2), rN48 and rK49 on proliferation of human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60, human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH, human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803, and human liver cancer cell line HepG2 were assessed by MTT assay. Their antitumor effects on sarcoma cell line S180 xenograft and EAC ascites cancer model in mice were detected. RESULTS: The relative enzymatic activities of rN48 and rK49 were 0 and 5% of that of rSSBPLA(2). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of rSSBPLA(2) for HL60, SK-N-SH, and MGC-803 cells were (45.28+/-0.09) microg/ml, (57.07+/-0.12) microg/ml, and (69.34+/-0.35) microg/ml, respectively, but it had no inhibitory effect on proliferation of HepG2 cells. rSSBPLA(2) obviously inhibited growth of S180 xenograft in miceu the inhibitory rates were 50.8%, 43.2%, 38.2%, and 55.5%, respectively, under the dose of 2 mg/kg (qd x 10), 2 mg/kg (q2d x 5), 4 mg/kg (qd x 1) and 4 mg/kg (q5d x 2). The inhibitory rate of EAC model was 33.5% under the dose of 4 mg/kg (q5d x 2). The inhibitory rates were significantly higher in test groups than in control groups (P<0.01). rN48 and rK49 had no inhibitory effect on proliferation of the 4 tumor cell lines and on growth of the xenograft tumors. CONCLUSION: The antitumor effect of rSSBPLA(2) may be closely related with its enzymatic activity.","['Liang, Yong-Ju', 'Yang, Xiao-Ping', 'Wei, Jian-Wen', 'Fu, Li-Wu', 'Jiang, Xiao-Yu', 'Chen, Shang-Wu', 'Yang, Wen-Li']","['Liang YJ', 'Yang XP', 'Wei JW', 'Fu LW', 'Jiang XY', 'Chen SW', 'Yang WL']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510060, P.

This study was to investigate the inducement effect of meisoindigo on apoptosis of myelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, and explore the possible mechanisms. METHODS: After treatment of meisoindigo, the proliferation of HL-60 cells was detected by trypan blue exclusion assay, and DNA fragmentation by agarose electrophoresis; cell morphology was observed under fluorescent microscope. Cell apoptosis and the expression of Fas were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9, PARP, Bcl-2, Bax and the concentration of cytochrome c in cytosol were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Meisoindigo inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. When treated with 20 micromol/L meisoindigo for 12-48 h, the proliferation of HL-60 cells was significantly inhibited. When treated for 1 h, the apoptosis rate of HL-60 cells was (3.70+/-0.56)%; the apoptosis rate was significantly higher in HL-60 cells treated for 3, 6, and 12 h than in control cells [(19.80+/-1.13)%, (29.20+/-2.69)%, and (47.05+/-7.70)% vs. (2.65+/-0.78)%, P<0.05]. When treated with meisoindigo for 3 h, typical changes of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation and DNA ladder, were detected in HL-60 cells. The positive rate of Fas was significantly higher in cells treated with 20 micromol/L meisoindigo for 1 h than in control cells [(21.30+/-1.27)% vs. (9.35+/-0.21)%, P<0.05]. Meisoindigo activated Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9 and PARP, down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, up-regulated the expression of Bax and the concentration of cytochrome c. Furthermore, pretreatment of caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk partially reversed the inhibitory effect of meisoindigo on cell proliferation, and decreased cell apoptosis; when treated with meisoindigo for 5 h, the apoptosis rate was significantly higher in pretreated cells than in cells without pretreatment [(29.8+/-5.4)% vs. (16.5+/-5.5)%, P<0.05]; when treated with meisoindigo for 12 h, the alive cell number was significantly lower in pretreated cells than in cells without pretreatment [(1.80+/-0.14) x 10(5)/ml vs. (3.57+/-0.18) x 10(5)/ml, P<0.05].

METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted among 231 consecutive Chinese patients with ET. The literature about leukemogenic risk associated with the use of hydroxyurea therapy was reviewed. RESULTS: The median patient age was 65 years. Thrombosis rates at and after diagnosis of ET were comparable to those of white patients, but bleeding rates at and after diagnosis were much lower. The projected 10-year thrombosis-free, bleeding-free, and overall survival rates were 66%, 83%, and 80%, respectively. There were no deaths among patients 60 years or younger during a maximum follow-up of 15 years, and splenomegaly at diagnosis of ET appeared to protect against thrombosis. In multivariate analysis, advanced age predicted inferior 10-year thrombosis-free and overall survival, and male sex predicted inferior bleeding-free survival. Half the deaths were related to ET. The probability of myelofibrosis transformation was 9.7% at 10 years. Prior myelofibrosis (P = .008) and the use of melphalan treatment (P = .002) were risk factors for acute myeloid leukemia evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Essential thrombocythemia is a benign disease of older persons. Chinese patients have a low risk of bleeding, and prior myelofibrosis is a major risk factor for evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. Leukemic transformation with hydroxyurea therapy alone is rare and warrants further prospective studies.","['Chim, Chor-Sang', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam', 'Lie, Albert Kwok-Wei', 'Ma, Siu-Kwan', 'Chan, Chi-Chung', 'Wong, Lap-Gate', 'Kho, Bonnie Chi San', 'Lee, Harold-Kwok', 'Sim, Joycelyn Pui-Yin', 'Chan, Cheuk-Hung', 'Chan, Joyce Chee-Wun', 'Yeung, Yiu-Ming', 'Law, Martin', 'Liang, Raymond']","['Chim CS', 'Kwong YL', 'Lie AK', 'Ma SK', 'Chan CC', 'Wong LG', 'Kho BC', 'Lee HK', 'Sim JP', 'Chan CH', 'Chan JC', 'Yeung YM', 'Law M', 'Liang R']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, 102 Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, ROC. jcschim@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Splenomegaly', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Thrombosis/*epidemiology', 'beta-Thalassemia/epidemiology']",,2005/12/14 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/12/14 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['165/22/2651 [pii]', '10.1001/archinte.165.22.2651 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 2005 Dec 12-26;165(22):2651-8. doi: 10.1001/archinte.165.22.2651.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the impact of these same prognostic factors have not been examined relative to treatment outcome with chemoimmunotherapy. METHODS: We examined the impact of these new prognostic factors on predicting treatment outcome in symptomatic, untreated CLL patients who received chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine and rituximab as part of a completed, randomized phase II study, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9712. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients treated as part of CALGB 9712 had detailed prognostic factor assessment performed. Using Ig V(H) mutational status to classify risk, there was no association between complete response rate with either unmutated Ig V(H) mutational status or high-risk interphase cytogenetics. However, the median progression-free survival (PFS; P = .048) and overall survival (OS; P = .01) were shorter among the Ig V(H) unmutated patients as compared with the Ig V(H) mutated patients. Using the hierarchical classification of Dohner, PFS (P = .005) and OS (P = .004) were significantly longer as the classification moved from high risk [del (11)(q22.3) or del (17)(p13.1)] to low risk. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that high-risk CLL patients characterized by Ig V(H) unmutated (> or = 98%) or high-risk interphase cytogenetics, including either del(17p) or del(11q), appear to have a shorter PFS and OS with chemoimmunotherapy.

The study reported here assessed outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in different stages of their disease, who were not considered candidates for conventional hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) because of age and/or other known risk factors and were given minimal conditioning followed by HCT from related or unrelated donors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study included 122 patients with AML, who were conditioned with 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0 with or without preceding fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d from days -4 to -2), and given postgrafting cyclosporine at 6.25 mg/kg twice daily from day -3 and mycophenolate mofetil at 15 mg/kg twice daily from day 0. RESULTS: Durable engraftment was observed in 95% of the patients. Cumulative incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease grades 2 to 4 at 6 months were 35% after related and 42% after unrelated HCT, respectively. With a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 26 to 79 months), 51 patients were alive, of whom 48 were in complete remission (CR). Cumulative nonrelapse mortalities were 10% and 22%, and cumulative mortalities from disease progression were 47% and 33% at 2 years for related and unrelated recipients, respectively. Overall, 2-year survival was 48%, and disease-free survival was 44%. Patients receiving transplantation in CR1 had 2-year overall survivals of 44% after related and 63% after unrelated HCT, respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that HCT from related and unrelated donors after low-dose TBI is a promising treatment for elderly patients with AML.","['Hegenbart, Ute', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Maris, Michael B', 'Shizuru, Judith A', 'Greinix, Hildegard', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Rio, Bernard', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Al-Ali, Haifa', 'Storer, Barry', 'Maloney, David', 'McSweeney, Peter', 'Chauncey, Thomas', 'Agura, Ed', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Petersen, Finn', 'Storb, Rainer']","['Hegenbart U', 'Niederwieser D', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Maris MB', 'Shizuru JA', 'Greinix H', 'Cordonnier C', 'Rio B', 'Gratwohl A', 'Lange T', 'Al-Ali H', 'Storer B', 'Maloney D', 'McSweeney P', 'Chauncey T', 'Agura E', 'Bruno B', 'Maziarz RT', 'Petersen F', 'Storb R']","['University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/radiotherapy/*surgery', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,2005/12/14 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/12/14 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.03.1765 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.1765 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 20;24(3):444-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.1765.

In this study, we assessed the efficacy and feasibility of chemotherapy combined with imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II study of imatinib-combined chemotherapy was conducted for newly diagnosed BCR-ABL-positive ALL in adults. Eighty patients were entered into the trial between September 2002 and January 2005. RESULTS: Remission induction therapy resulted in complete remission (CR) in 77 patients (96.2%), resistant disease in one patient, and early death in two patients, as well as polymerase chain reaction negativity of bone marrow in 71.3%. The profile and incidence of severe toxicity were not different from those associated with our historic chemotherapy-alone regimen. Relapse occurred in 20 patients after median CR duration of 5.2 months. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed for 49 patients, 39 of whom underwent transplantation during their first CR. The 1-year event-free and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated to be 60.0%, and 76.1%, respectively, which were significantly better than those for our historic controls treated with chemotherapy alone (P < .0001 for both). Among the current trial patients, the probability for OS at 1 year was 73.3% for those who underwent allogeneic HSCT, and 84.8% for those who did not. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that imatinib-combined regimen is effective and feasible for newly diagnosed BCR-ABL-positive ALL. Despite a relatively short period of observation, a major potential of this treatment is recognized.

Using imatinib to reduce leukemic burden also facilitates the detailed investigation into how the persistence of CML disease depends on BCR-ABL signaling, particularly within the leukemic stem cell compartment. Mathematical models of drug resistance and disease relapse, in addition to experimental systems that recapitulate crucial aspects of advanced disease have deepened our understanding of CML biology.

Our previous data have shown that beauvericin induces cell death in CCRF-CEM cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and that this beauvericin-induced cell death can be prevented by administration of intracellular calcium chelator-BAPTA. Therefore, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) may play an important role in beauvericin-induced cell death in CCRF-CEM cells. In this study, the effect of beauvericin on [Ca2+]i and the possible mechanism responsible for the changes of [Ca2+]i in CCRF-CEM cells were investigated. Beauvericin caused a rapid and sustained [Ca2+]i rise in a dose-dependent manner. Excess extracellular Ca2+ facilitated beauvericin-induced [Ca2+]i rise by adding 1 mM CaCl2 in the bathing medium. On the other hand, beauvericin-induced [Ca2+]i rise was prevented in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution by 200 microM EGTA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a quantitative sandwich immunoassay technique (ELISA) (Quantikine, Human IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, R&D Systems), we measured the concentration of IGF-1 and its major binding protein IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in serum drawn at the time of diagnosis from 77 Binet stage A CLL patients. RESULTS: Either IGF-1 or IGFBP-3 were significantly decreased compared with healthy age- and sex-matched controls (P < 0.0001 for both; Mann-Whitney test). Serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 paralleled each other (P = 0.002); in contrast, no significant correlation was found between serum levels of IGF-1 and clinico-hematological variables including age (P = 0.253), sex (P = 0.270), Rai clinical substages (P = 0.140), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.956), beta2-microglobulin (P = 0.368), lymphocyte count (P = 0.703) and lymphocyte doubling time (LDT, P = 0.233). When correlation were attempted with circulating levels of angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (P = 0.971), basic fibroblastic growth factor (P = 0.695), angiogenin (P = 0.282) or adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (P = 0.318), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (P = 0.883) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (P = 0.772) similar results were found. Serum levels of IGF-1 were further evaluated as a dichotomous variable with respect to progression-free survival (PFS), an endpoint surrogate for overall survival in early B-cell CLL. The best separation of curves was seen with the cutoff point at the 75th percentile of IGF-1 levels (i.e., 93 pg/mL). Median PFS was 63 months in the patient group with low IGF-1, compared with a median PFS of 40 months in the remaining patients (P = 0.03). In the multivariate analysis performed including variables significant at univariate analysis [i.e. Rai substage (P = 0.002); LDT (P = 0.004), IGF-1 (P = 0.01)], only Rai substage retained prognostic significance (P = 0.006). However, after removing from analysis LDT (only six of 77 had an LDT < 12 months), either IGF-1 or Rai substage entered the model at a significant level (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: IGF-1 did not correlate with markers of tumor burden or clinical status in CLL thus suggesting that levels of this cytokine do not reflect the intrinsic malignancy of disease. Results of the present study highlight, however, its involvement in mechanisms of disease progression in early CLL.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Vitelli, Gaetano', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Digiesu, Giovanna', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Ribatti, Domenico', 'Vacca, Angelo']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Mirabelli R', 'Digiesu G', 'Giannarelli D', 'Cuneo A', 'Ribatti D', 'Vacca A']","['Medical Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/blood', 'Humans', 'Hydro-Lyases/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/mortality/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Burden', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",,2005/12/14 09:00,2006/03/02 09:00,['2005/12/14 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH553 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00553.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Jan;76(1):51-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00553.x.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 4.2.1.- (Hydro-Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.1.54 (lactate dehydratase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, four genes implicated in the development of AML were examined for promoter CpG island hypermethylation in cells from 37 patients with different stages of MDS. Aberrant methylation was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The highest rate of methylation was found for p15INK4B (51%), followed by HIC1 (32%), CDH1 (27%), and ER (19%). Concurrent hypermethylation of > or = 3 genes was more frequent in advanced compared with early-stage MDS (P < or = 0.05), and hypermethylation of p15INK4B was associated with leukemic transformation in early MDS (P < or = 0.05). The median overall survival was 17 months for cases showing hypermethylation of > or = 1 genes vs. 67 months for cases without hypermethylation (P = 0.002). Specifically, promoter hypermethylation identified a subgroup of early MDS with a particularly poor prognosis (median overall survival 20 months vs. 102 months; P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis including stage and thrombocyte count, hypermethylation of > or = 1 genes was an independent negative prognostic factor (P < 0.05).

However, the pathogenesis of the differentiation from leukemic progenitors to eosinophils is not well understood in this type of leukemia. Recent reports showed that a novel fusion tyrosine kinase, Fip1-like1 (FIP1L1) platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha), is found in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. The involvement of another chimeric gene, PDGFRbeta, was also reported in myeloproliferative disorder with eosinophilia. These chimeric genes cause constitutive activation of PDGFR tyrosine kinases. On the other hand, a two-hit model for the pathogenesis of AML, which seems to be caused by inactivating mutations in transcription factors and genetic lesions in tyrosine kinase resulting in constitutive activation, has been proposed. On the basis of these findings, we screened for the expression of the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene and for mutations in the juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of PDGFRalpha/beta genes in 22 cases of CBF leukemia with eosinophilia. Among these cases, no FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene was found. Although cDNA sequencing also detected three types of single-nucleotide alterations at kinase domains in PDGFRalpha/beta genes, all of them were silent changes and polymorphisms.

METHODS: We analysed the outcome of 61 patients with CML who had received allogeneic HCT from sibling (n = 18) or unrelated (n = 43) donors after having been treated with IM. Forty-one patients had received IM because of accelerated or blast phase CML. Conditioning therapy contained standard doses of busulfan (n = 25) or total-body irradiation (n = 20) in conjunction with cyclophosphamide in the majority of cases. Sixteen patients received dose-reduced conditioning with fludarabine-based regimens. RESULTS: The incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV graft-versus-host disease was 66% and 38% respectively. The probability of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse at 18 months for the whole patient cohort were 37%, 33% and 24% respectively. The probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 d and 12 months was 30% and 46% respectively. Univariate analysis showed that fludarabine-based conditioning therapy, age > or = 40 yr and >12 months interval between diagnosis and transplantation were associated with a significantly lower OS and DFS and a higher NRM.

However, data is still unavailable and due to high remission rates, most patients randomized to interferon-alpha in a clinical trial crossed over to imatinib. Therefore, to assess the expected long-term survival advantage with imatinib, a simulation study based on prognostic factors validated for interferon-alpha treatment was performed. METHODS: In interferon-alpha-treated patients with intermediate-risk and low-risk according to the established New CML score, survival probabilities of patients with MCR were significantly higher than those of patients without MCR. Three samples with simulated survival data for imatinib-treated intermediate-risk patients were constituted by randomly drawing varying percentages of their survival times from interferon-alpha-treated intermediate-risk patients with MCR and the remaining data from intermediate-risk patients without MCR. The same procedure was applied to low-risk patients. RESULTS: The 10-year survival probabilities of inter-feron-alpha-treated intermediate-risk and low-risk patients were 0.22 and 0.37. In the simulated samples, when 80%, 65%, and 50% of survival times were as favorable as for interferon-alpha-treated patients with MCR, respectively, the corresponding survival probabilities were 0.43 and 0.57, 0.36 and 0.49, and 0.30 and 0.42. CONCLUSIONS: In all simulation samples, increments of survival probabilities by imatinib were predicted, although survival probabilities of patients with MCR were assumed to be lower than with interferon-alpha. Prognosticated survival advantage with imatinib is backed by increasing observation time of imatinib-treated patients in real studies.","['Pfirrmann, M', 'Hasford, J']","['Pfirrmann M', 'Hasford J']","['IBE Institut fur Medizinische Informatik, Biometrie und Epidemiologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munchen, Germany. pfi@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Methods Inf Med,Methods of information in medicine,0210453,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', '*Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2005/12/14 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/12/14 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Methods Inf Med. 2005;44(4):577-83.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD33 antigen is present on 90% of acute myeloid leukemia blasts and is shared on normal hemopoietic cells only on the non stem dillerentiating fraction. Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) is an engineered humanized antibody anti-CD33 conjugated with a potent intercalating agent, named calicheamicin, which is release only at intracellular level (lower pH), following a selective binding to CD33-positive cells, thus representing a promising approach for target anti-leukemia therapy. GO was approved conditionally by the Federal Drug Administration in May 2000 as a single therapy for first recurrence of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in a subset of older patients. Since 2000, treatment trials and pilot studies have revealed potential expanded applications along with potential limitations. Phase II trials have confirmed the activity and the efficacy of GO as single agent in the treatment of relapsed AML. More recently, clinical trials on induction and post-remission treatment of adult AML have shown efficacy of GO in combination chemotherapy. The strong and homogeneous CD33 expression in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), have resulted in an effective treatment of this disease with GO used as salvage treatment, as well as innovative approach for molecular relapsed patients. However, the incidence of veno-occlusive disease, better defined as sinusoidal occlusive syndrome (SOS), must be taken into account as potential complication associated with the GO administration, especially in patients treated with ablative regimens. In conclusion, the extension of the approval in Italy to AML CD33+ in relapsed, regardless age limitation, along with the ongoing evaluation by the European EMEA, represent the basis for a large clinical application of GO in myeloid malignancies potentially extended to paediatric patients with AML and to ALL CD33+.","['Di Rocco, A', 'Finolezzi, E', 'Anaclerico, B', 'Calabrese, E', 'Levi, A', 'Trasarti, S', 'Tafuri, A']","['Di Rocco A', 'Finolezzi E', 'Anaclerico B', 'Calabrese E', 'Levi A', 'Trasarti S', 'Tafuri A']","['Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Roma, Italia. agotaf@bce.uniroma1.it']",['ita'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Clin Ter,La Clinica terapeutica,0372604,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', '*Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Enediynes', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",27,2005/12/14 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/12/14 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Ter. 2005 Jul-Aug;156(4):183-6.,,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Enediynes)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '108212-75-5 (calicheamicin gamma(1)I)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",,,,,Approcci terapeutici innovativi in oncoematologia: terapia mirata anti-CD33.,,,,,,,,,,

Recent progress in defining sub-cellular events has contributed to our understanding of the production of genetic lesions in irradiated cells but the importance of tissue effects in response to radiation damage has attracted much less attention. Thus, genetic lesions induced by radiation are considered to result from the deposition of energy in the cell nucleus and the initiating lesion for radiation-induced transformation has been similarly attributed to direct DNA damage. Recently, however, there have been many reports of radiation effects, characteristically associated with the consequences of energy deposition in the cell nucleus, arising in non-irradiated cells as a consequence of communication with irradiated cells. These, so-called, non-targeted radiation effects pose major challenges to current views of the mechanisms of radiation-induced DNA damage and the mechanisms underlying radiogenic malignancies. Considered together with data obtained from laboratory model systems, a rather complex picture of radiation leukaemogenesis is emerging in which, additional to any damage induced directly in target stem cells, the haemopoietic microenvironment can be a source of damaging signals and cellular interactions make important genotype-dependent contributions to determining overall outcome after radiation exposures.","['Wright, Eric G']",['Wright EG'],"['University of Dundee, Cancer Biology and Clinical Pathology Unit, Division of Pathology and Neuroscience, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, UK. e.g.wright@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Bystander Effect/*radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology/radiation effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/*radiation effects', 'Genomic Instability/*radiation effects', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoiesis/radiation effects', '*Leukemia/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*radiation effects', 'Stem Cells/parasitology/radiation effects']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/02/09 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.763 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2005 Sep-Dec;23(3-4):119-26. doi: 10.1002/hon.763.,,,,,,,,,,"['2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

METHODS: In the current study, the efficacy of lonafarnib was investigated in patients with CML in the chronic or accelerated phase that was resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Thirteen patients with CML in the chronic (n = 6 patients) or accelerated (n = 7 patients) phase were treated with lonafarnib at a dose of 200 mg orally twice daily. Ten patients had failed therapy with imatinib and 3 patients were intolerant to imatinib. The median age of the patients was 62 years (range, 38-80 yrs) and the median time from the diagnosis of CML to therapy with lonafarnib was 5 years (range, 0.3-13 yrs). In addition to imatinib mesylate, all patients had received prior therapy with interferon-alpha and seven patients had received other treatments. The median duration of therapy with lonafarnib was 8 weeks (range, 2-41 wks). RESULTS: Two patients responded. One patient in the accelerated phase of CML returned to the chronic phase, a response that lasted for 3 months. Another patient with chronic phase disease had lowering of the leukocyte count without the need for hydroxyurea and normalization of the differential count that lasted for 5 months. The most common adverse event was diarrhea, which was noted in 11 patients (84%) (Grade > or = 3 in 4 patients; 31%; toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]). Therapy was discontinued in one patient because of diarrhea not responding to dose adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent lonafarnib appears to have clinical activity in a small proportion of patients with CML refractory to imatinib.","['Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Daley, George', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Giles, Francis', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Sugrue, Mary', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Borthakur G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Daley G', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Giles F', 'Faderl S', 'Sugrue M', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

Knowledge of their risk of developing a new primary cancer is important not only in relation to potential side effects of their cancer treatment, but also in relation to the possibility of shared etiology with other types of cancer. A cohort of 525,527 women with primary breast cancer was identified from 13 population-based cancer registries in Europe, Canada, Australia and Singapore, and followed for second primary cancers within the period 1943-2000. We used cancer incidence rates of first primary cancer for the calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of second primary cancer. Risk of second primary breast cancer after various types of nonbreast cancer was also computed. For all second cancer sites combined, except contralateral breast cancer, we found a SIR of 1.25 (95% CI = 1.24-1.26) on the basis of 31,399 observed cases after first primary breast cancer. The overall risk increased with increasing time since breast cancer diagnosis and decreased by increasing age at breast cancer diagnosis. There were significant excesses of many different cancer sites; among these the excess was larger than 150 cases for stomach (SIR = 1.35), colorectal (SIR = 1.22), lung (SIR = 1.24), soft tissue sarcoma (SIR = 2.25), melanoma (SIR = 1.29), non-melanoma skin (SIR = 1.58), endometrium (SIR = 1.52), ovary (SIR = 1.48), kidney (SIR = 1.27), thyroid gland (SIR = 1.62) and leukaemia (SIR = 1.52).

Quinazoline, at micromolar concentrations, induced morphological changes and necrosis of B16 cells, and at nanomolar concentrations it produced changes of F-actin cytoskeleton. It did not cause changes in the cell cycle, did not induce apoptotic cell death in B16 cells, did not have a mutagenic effect, and did not even behave as a typical intercalating agent. Little significant reduction of tumor volume in intramuscular transplanted B16 cells was observed.

This study was undertaken to determine if any strategy was broadly applicable in a clinical flow cytometry laboratory. Expression of Zap-70 was determined in 37 CLL patients using four different commercial antibodies. T, NK, and CLL cells were identified by immunophenotyping along with Zap-70 expression. Data was analyzed in terms of both percent of CLL cells expressing Zap-70 and the ratio of Zap-70 expression in CLL cells compared to that in T + NK cells. Three Zap-70 antibodies showed wide ranges of Zap-70 expression as a percentage of tumor cells, while a fourth gave consistently elevated results. Comparing the percent Zap-70 expression with any two antibodies gave poor correlations (r(2) = 0.45-0.63). Our results indicated that the previous analytical strategies were not reproducible. A ratio metric is proposed, which gave better correlations (r(2) as high as 0.95) and would allow separation of CLL patients with elevated or decreased Zap-70 expression.","['Bakke, Antony C', 'Purtzer, Zoe', 'Leis, Jose', 'Huang, James']","['Bakke AC', 'Purtzer Z', 'Leis J', 'Huang J']","['Department of Pathology/Laboratory Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA. bakkea@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

It has been suggested that antidepressants inhibit membrane glucocorticoid transporters like P-Glycoprotein (Pgp) and hence enhance the intracellular glucocorticoid concentration, leading to an increased glucocorticoid-receptor mediated gene transcription and therefore to normalization of the function of the HPA axis. The aim of this study is to investigate inhibition of Pgp by several different antidepressants. METHODS: We characterized the inhibitory potencies of the antidepressants in two in vitro assays by using calcein-AM as Pgp substrate. The two different cell-systems expressing Pgp were: 1. PBCEC (porcine brain capillary endothelial cells) as model for the blood-brain-barrier, and 2. A human lymphocytic leukaemia cell line CEM and the multi-drug-resistant (MDR) cell line VLB-100, expressing Pgp as model for the human protein. RESULTS: All of the antidepressants tested inhibit the transport of calcein-AM by Pgp in the micromolecular range. DISCUSSION: Because this inhibition is only seen at concentrations above therapeutically relevant plasma levels, their effect my not play a role for the mechanism of action of the antidepressants tested.","['Weber, C C', 'Kressmann, S', 'Ott, M', 'Fricker, G', 'Muller, W E']","['Weber CC', 'Kressmann S', 'Ott M', 'Fricker G', 'Muller WE']","['Department of Pharmacology, Biocenter, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pharmacopsychiatry,Pharmacopsychiatry,8402938,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects', 'Capillaries/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Swine']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-916184 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacopsychiatry. 2005 Nov;38(6):293-300. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-916184.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antidepressive Agents)', '0 (Antipsychotic Agents)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)', '148504-34-1 (calcein AM)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wish to discuss a case of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) presenting as secondary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), its clinical and pathological features and maternal outcome. CASE REPORT: We describe a 28-year-old woman who presented with secondary PPH accompanied by bleeding from gums, marked pallor, hematemesis, ecchymotic and purpuric spots all over the body, 8 days post-partum. Investigations revealed her to be having APL, a diagnosis not suspected by the referring clinic. She was given supportive therapy but died before chemotherapy could be started. CONCLUSION: The case emphasizes the importance of suspecting, investigating and energetically treating uncommon causes such as acute leukemia when an unusually severe clinical picture in a postpartum setting suggests such a possibility. This may prove to be life saving, particularly if the leukemia happens to be APL, a cancer with a very high cure rate.","['Sharma, J B', 'Gupta, Nupur', 'Vimala, N', 'Anand, Mona', 'Deka, Deepika', 'Mittal, Suneeta']","['Sharma JB', 'Gupta N', 'Vimala N', 'Anand M', 'Deka D', 'Mittal S']","['Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology & Laboratory Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. jbsharma@eth.net']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Arch Gynecol Obstet,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,8710213,IM,"['Adult', 'Ecchymosis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gingival Hemorrhage', 'Hematemesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Pregnancy']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00404-005-0094-y [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2006 Feb;273(5):310-1. doi: 10.1007/s00404-005-0094-y.

It is characterized by multiple colon as well as extracolonic cancers such as endometrial, ovarian and urinary tract cancers. In addition, it is well known that some cases of HNPCC can present with unique tumor spectrums such as sebaceous tumors, which is often referred to as the 'Muir-Torre' syndrome. In recent years there have been a few reports of families presenting with early onset of colon tumors along with cafe-au-lait spots and/or hematologic malignancies often associated with homozygous mutations involving one of the mismatch repair genes. In this article we have performed a comprehensive review of the entire medical literature to identify all cases with similar presentations reported in the literature and have summarized the clinical features and genetic test results of the same. The available data clearly highlight such presentations as a distinct clinical entity characterized by early onset of gastrointestinal tumors, hematologic malignancies as well as features of neurofibromatosis (easily remembered by the acronym ;CoLoN'; Colon tumors or/and Leukemia/Lymphoma or/and Neurofibromatosis features). Furthermore, there has also been some evidence that the neurofibromatosis type-1 gene is a mutational target of the mismatch repair deficiency that is seen in families with HNPCC, and that mlh1 deficiency can accelerate the development of leukemia in neurofibromatosis (Nf1) heterozygous mice. Recognition of this syndrome has significant importance in terms of earlier detection of cancers, cancer screening recommendations as well as genetic counseling offered to such families.","['Bandipalliam, Prathap']",['Bandipalliam P'],"['Department of Adult Oncology, Division of Population Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis/*complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Mutation', 'Neurofibromatoses/*etiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Syndrome']",35,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10689-005-8351-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2005;4(4):323-33. doi: 10.1007/s10689-005-8351-6.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in oncogenic, degenerative or inflammatory changes. The myelopathy associated to HTLV-I or tropical spastic paraparesia (HAM/TSP) is a mainly degenerative response to the virus infection. On the other hand, Sjogren syndrome has an inflammatory appearance. The immunohistochemical study of CD-4, CD-8 and CD45 lymphocytes, metalloproteinase MMP-9 and viral Tax protein in pathological samples of salivary glands may help to differentiate primary from viral Sicca syndrome. AIM: To perform an immunohistochemical study of salivary glands of patients with HAM/TSP and Sicca syndrome and control subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pathological samples of salivary glands from 53 patients with HAM/TSP and Sicca syndrome and 10 control subjects, were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against CD-4, CD-8 and CD-45 lymphocytes, metalloproteinase MMP-9 and viral Tax protein. RESULTS: Only in patients with HAM/TSP and Sicca syndrome, the presence of Tax protein was observed in CD-4 and CD-8 lymphocytes and in glandular acini.

The positive clinical experience seen in MDS to date coupled with the persistent challenges faced in the treatment of other hematologic malignancies has served as the impetus for further exploration of the therapeutic value of DNMT inhibitors beyond MDS. In that respect, the majority of data for these agents are in the setting of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Experience with these agents in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (reclassified by the World Health Organization as AML) was also reported in the clinical trials submitted to the FDA for approval of azacitidine for MDS. Some use has also been described in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Further studies are needed to clarify the appropriate dose and the number and duration of cycles in the treatment of leukemias, and to identify ideal candidates for therapy, explore the role of DNMT inhibitors in combination with other agents, especially histone deacetylase inhibitors, delineate differences between the commercially available agents, and establish the long-term safety of these agents.

DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors--azacitidine and decitabine--have significant activity in the treatment of MDS. Despite marked activity in myeloid malignancy, monotherapy with DNMT inhibitors is limited by low complete and partial response rates (7-20%) and median response durations of 15 months. As with classical cytotoxic therapy, the targeting of biologic pathways and mechanisms may best be accomplished using a combination of agents offering complementary mechanisms and synergistic pharmacodynamic interactions. The goal of this approach is to improve response rates, quality, and duration, and to minimize adverse events. There are a number of new therapies under development for the management of MDS and AML. This review article touches on some of the more promising combination regimens in various phases of investigation. The treatment of MDS and AML is undergoing rapid evolution. Cytogenetic complete remission and prolonged survival represent important goals. Incremental improvements in disease state and quality-of-life issues are also important for patients. Given the overall failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the achievement of cures in MDS and MDS-related AML, the application of less toxic, biologically directed agents may represent a more promising approach to treatment.

Mechanism-based laboratory studies suggest that clinical optimization of therapy with DNMT inhibitors needs to include optimizing intracellular drug uptake and maximizing drug exposure over time while still using lower doses to avoid cytotoxicity. Clinical studies suggest that increased dose intensity and multiple cycles of administration substantially increase response rates. Other strategies for optimizing the efficacy of DNMT inhibitor therapy also include identification of patients that are best qualified for treatment, and defining in vivo mechanisms of patient responses.

Herein, we demonstrate that alemtuzumab promotes rapid death of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in vitro, in a complement and accessory cell free system. Using minimal detergent solubilization of CLL membranes, we found that CD52 colocalizes with ganglioside GM-1, a marker of membrane rafts. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that upon crosslinking CD52 with alemtuzumab+anti-Fc IgG, large patches, and in many cases caps, enriched in CD52 and GM-1 formed upon the CLL cell plasma membrane. Depletion of membrane cholesterol or inhibition of actin polymerization significantly diminished the formation of alemtuzumab-induced caps and reduced alemtuzumab-mediated CLL cell death. We compared alemtuzumab-induced direct cytotoxicity, effector cell-mediated toxicity and complement-mediated cytotoxicity of CLL cells to normal T cells. The direct cytotoxicity and observed capping was significantly greater for CLL cells as compared to normal T cells. Cell-mediated and complement-mediated cytotoxicity did not significantly differ between the two cell types. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that alemtuzumab can initiate CLL cell death by crosslinking CD52-enriched lipid rafts. Furthermore, the differential direct cytotoxic effect suggests that CD52 directed antibodies could possibly be engineered to more specifically target CLL cells.","['Mone, A P', 'Cheney, C', 'Banks, A L', 'Tridandapani, S', 'Mehter, N', 'Guster, S', 'Lin, T', 'Eisenbeis, C F', 'Young, D C', 'Byrd, J C']","['Mone AP', 'Cheney C', 'Banks AL', 'Tridandapani S', 'Mehter N', 'Guster S', 'Lin T', 'Eisenbeis CF', 'Young DC', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Actins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/drug effects/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/drug effects/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Caspases/*drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/metabolism', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/biosynthesis', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/*metabolism', 'beta-Cyclodextrins/pharmacology']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404014 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):272-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404014.,['P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the expression pattern and regulation of TCL1 in CLL, we assessed 213 primary tumors by immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow-cytometry and/or Western blot, using a new monoclonal antibody. TCL1 protein was detectable in the majority of CLL (90% by IHC) but showed marked variations across cases with virtual absence in approximately 10% of tumors. Higher TCL1 levels correlated with markers of the 'pre-germinal center' CLL subtype including unmutated VH status (P=0.005), ZAP70 expression (P=0.007), and presence of chromosome 11q22-23 deletions (P=0.04). Intratumoral heterogeneity in TCL1 levels was also prominent and explained in part by markedly lower TCL1 expression in proliferating tumor cells. In vitro exposure of CLL cells to interleukin-4 (but not other growth factors) produced progressive and irreversible decrease in TCL1 protein levels in association with the onset of proliferation. TCL1 expression patterns in CLL are complex and highly dynamic and appear to reflect both the histogenetic subtypes of the disease and the growth parameters of individual tumors. The observed regulation pattern suggests that TCL1 may exert its effects predominantly in the unmutated/ZAP70-positive tumor subset.","['Herling, M', 'Patel, K A', 'Khalili, J', 'Schlette, E', 'Kobayashi, R', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Jones, D']","['Herling M', 'Patel KA', 'Khalili J', 'Schlette E', 'Kobayashi R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Jones D']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404017 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):280-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404017.,['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of the five t(5;9)(q33;q22)+ unspecified PTCL shared a very similar histological pattern with predominant involvement of lymphoid follicles and the same CD3+CD5+CD4+bcl-6+CD10+ immunophenotype.

We examined WT1 expression patterns in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where its clinical implication remains unclear. Using a real-time quantitative PCR designed according to Europe Against Cancer Program recommendations, we evaluated WT1 expression in 125 consecutively enrolled patients with childhood ALL (106 BCP-ALL, 19 T-ALL) and compared it with physiologic WT1 expression in normal and regenerating bone marrow (BM). In childhood B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, we detected a wide range of WT1 levels (5 logs) with a median WT1 expression close to that of normal BM. WT1 expression in childhood T-ALL was significantly higher than in BCP-ALL (P<0.001). Patients with MLL-AF4 translocation showed high WT1 overexpression (P<0.01) compared to patients with other or no chromosomal aberrations. Older children (> or =10 years) expressed higher WT1 levels than children under 10 years of age (P<0.001), while there was no difference in WT1 expression in patients with peripheral blood leukocyte count (WBC) > or =50 x 10(9)/l and lower. Analysis of relapsed cases (14/125) indicated that an abnormal increase or decrease in WT1 expression was associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse (P=0.0006), and this prognostic impact of WT1 was independent of other main risk factors (P=0.0012). In summary, our study suggests that WT1 expression in childhood ALL is very variable and much lower than in AML or adult ALL. WT1, thus, will not be a useful marker for MRD detection in childhood ALL, however, it does represent a potential independent risk factor in childhood ALL. Interestingly, a proportion of childhood ALL patients express WT1 at levels below the normal physiological BM WT1 expression, and this reduced WT1 expression appears to be associated with a higher risk of relapse.","['Boublikova, L', 'Kalinova, M', 'Ryan, J', 'Quinn, F', ""O'Marcaigh, A"", 'Smith, O', 'Browne, P', 'Stary, J', 'McCann, S R', 'Trka, J', 'Lawler, M']","['Boublikova L', 'Kalinova M', 'Ryan J', 'Quinn F', ""O'Marcaigh A"", 'Smith O', 'Browne P', 'Stary J', 'McCann SR', 'Trka J', 'Lawler M']","[""Department of Hematology, Durkan Leukemia Research Laboratories, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Trinity College and St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. boublikl@tcd.ie""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404047 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404047 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):254-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404047.,,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about signal transduction pathways which may be involved in enhanced survival of MDS cells. In this report, we have performed immunocytochemical and flow cytometric analysis to evaluate the levels of activated Akt in bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients diagnosed with MDS. We observed high levels of Ser473 phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) staining in 90% of the cases (n=22) diagnosed as high-risk MDS, whereas mononuclear cells from normal bone marrow or low-risk MDS patients showed low or absent Ser473 p-Akt staining. Furthermore, all high-risk MDS patients also demonstrated high expression of the Class I PI3K p110delta catalytic subunit and a decreased expression of PTEN.

Gene expression microarrays allow for a more genome-wide approach to assess possible genetic risk factors for t-ML. We assessed gene expression profiles (n=12 625 probe sets) in diagnostic acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells from 228 children treated on protocols that included leukemogenic agents such as etoposide, 13 of whom developed t-ML. Expression of 68 probes, corresponding to 63 genes, was significantly related to risk of t-ML. Hierarchical clustering of these probe sets clustered patients into three groups with 94, 122 and 12 patients, respectively; 12 of the 13 patients who went on to develop t-ML were overrepresented in the latter group (P<0.0001). A permutation test indicated a low likelihood that these probe sets and clusters were obtained by chance (P<0.001). Distinguishing genes included transcription-related oncogenes (v-Myb, Pax-5), cyclins (CCNG1, CCNG2 and CCND1) and histone HIST1H4C. Common transcription factor recognition elements among similarly up- or downregulated genes included several involved in hematopoietic differentiation or leukemogenesis (Maz, PU.1, ARNT).

Accordingly, agents that enhance the immunogenicity of CLL cells may be useful in immunotherapeutic approaches to this disease. Since Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are major regulators of innate immunity and initiation of adaptive immunity, we studied the effects of viral pathogen associated molecular pattern agonists (that are recognized by TLRs) on the costimulatory phenotype and function of CLL cells. CLL cells (especially those with high endogenous expression of CD38) responded to TLR7-activating imidazoquinolines and guanosine analogs by increasing costimulatory molecule expression, producing inflammatory cytokines, and becoming more sensitive to killing by cytotoxic effectors. Additional activation of protein kinase C pathways increased the ability to stimulate T-cell proliferation, blocked phosphorylation of the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, and resulted in the acquisition of a dendritic cell surface phenotype by TLR7-activated CLL cells. Normal B cells also responded to TLR7 activation by increasing costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production. These findings suggest a potential role for TLR7 agonists in CLL immunotherapy.","['Spaner, D E', 'Shi, Y', 'White, D', 'Mena, J', 'Hammond, C', 'Tomic, J', 'He, L', 'Tomai, M A', 'Miller, R L', 'Booth, J', 'Radvanyi, L']","['Spaner DE', 'Shi Y', 'White D', 'Mena J', 'Hammond C', 'Tomic J', 'He L', 'Tomai MA', 'Miller RL', 'Booth J', 'Radvanyi L']","[""Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Canada. spanerd@srcl.sunnybrook.utoronto.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chemokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404061 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404061 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):286-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404061.,,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (S 28690)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This findings suggest that haploinsufficiency of NPM1 may play a role in subtypes of myelodysplasias and leukemias.","['Berger, R', 'Busson, M', 'Baranger, L', 'Helias, C', 'Lessard, M', 'Dastugue, N', 'Speleman, F']","['Berger R', 'Busson M', 'Baranger L', 'Helias C', 'Lessard M', 'Dastugue N', 'Speleman F']","['1EMI 0210 Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France. berger@necker.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404063 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404063 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):319-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404063.,,"['0 (NPM-MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The archetype of this class of hematological diseases is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, the result of t(9;22)(q34;q11), and the associated BCR-ABL1 oncogene. Some of the Ph-negative myeloproliferative diseases are characterized by other chromosomal translocations involving a variety of tyrosine kinase genes, including ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, and JAK2. The majority of Ph-negative CMPDs, however, such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis are not characterized by the presence of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities. Recent studies have identified the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, generated due to a small cryptic deletion on chromosome 4q12, and the activating V617F mutation in JAK2 in a significant fraction of Ph-negative CMPDs. These results show that abnormalities in tyrosine kinase genes are central to the molecular pathogenesis of CMPDs. Genome-wide screenings to identify novel tyrosine kinase abnormalities in CMPDs may contribute to further improvement of the diagnosis and the treatment of these diseases.","['De Keersmaecker, K', 'Cools, J']","['De Keersmaecker K', 'Cools J']","['Department of Human Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics']",69,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404064 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404064 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):200-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404064.,,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address these questions, we evaluated the effect of gemcitabine and cisplatin combination chemotherapy on the immunity of pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: Thirteen patients with far advanced pancreatic cancer were enrolled and 7 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were included as a control group. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the amounts of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer cells, CD4, and CD8 T cells were reduced. With this numerical suppression, NK cell cytotoxicity to K562 leukemia cells was also significantly impaired (7.7% +/- 4.9% versus 21.7% +/- 7.9% of DNA loss; P = 0.016). Serum concentrations of VEGF and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were higher than the control group (192.1 +/- 114.7 versus 50.8 +/- 39.5 pg/mL of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 122 +/- 68.9 versus 111.4 +/- 37.4 pg/mL of IL-10). After 1 cycle of gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy, the impaired immunity of patients with pancreatic cancer was restored. Specifically, the recovery of DCs occurred rapidly and exceeded the value of healthy controls. Levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and VEGF, gradually decreased during chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic chemotherapy seems to be beneficial for restoring the impaired immunity of patients with pancreatic cancer, and one of the ideal times to collect DCs for immunotherapy is after completing each cycle of chemotherapy.","['Bang, Seungmin', 'Kim, Han-Soo', 'Choo, Yee Shin', 'Park, Seung Woo', 'Chung, Jae Bock', 'Song, Si Young']","['Bang S', 'Kim HS', 'Choo YS', 'Park SW', 'Chung JB', 'Song SY']","['Institute of Gastroenterology, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pancreas,Pancreas,8608542,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Interleukin-10/blood', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['00006676-200601000-00005 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mpa.0000191651.32420.41 [doi]']",ppublish,Pancreas. 2006 Jan;32(1):29-36. doi: 10.1097/01.mpa.0000191651.32420.41.,,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We quantitated gene expression using real-time RT-PCR analysis during conversion of primary cultured human renal tubular cells (RTC) to myofibroblasts after treatment with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). We report herein the limitations of commonly used reference genes for mRNA quantitation. METHODS: We determined the expression of alphaSMA and megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1), a transcriptional regulator of alphaSMA, by quantitative real-time PCR using three common internal controls, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cyclophilin A and 18S rRNA. RESULTS: Expression of GAPDH mRNA and cyclophilin A mRNA, and to a lesser extent, 18S rRNA levels varied over time in culture and with exposure to TGF-beta1. Thus, depending on which reference gene was used, TGF-beta1 appeared to have different effects on expression of MKL1 and alphaSMA. CONCLUSIONS: RTC converting to myofibroblasts in primary culture is a valuable system to study renal fibrosis in humans. However, variability in expression of reference genes with TGF-beta1 treatment illustrates the need to validate mRNA quantitation with multiple reference genes to provide accurate interpretation of fibrosis studies in the absence of a universal internal standard for mRNA expression.","['Elberg, Gerard', 'Elberg, Dorit', 'Logan, Charlotte J', 'Chen, Lijuan', 'Turman, Martin A']","['Elberg G', 'Elberg D', 'Logan CJ', 'Chen L', 'Turman MA']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA. gerard-elberg@ouhsc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Nephron Exp Nephrol,Nephron.

They can be cured by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, but this therapeutic option is not available to most patients. The transfer of a regulated beta-globin gene in autologous HSCs is a highly attractive alternative treatment. This strategy, which is simple in principle, raises major challenges in terms of controlling expression of the globin transgene, which ideally should be erythroid specific, differentiation- and stage-restricted, elevated, position independent, and sustained over time. Using lentiviral vectors, May et al. demonstrated in 2000 that an optimized combination of proximal and distal transcriptional control elements permits lineage-specific and elevated beta-globin expression, resulting in therapeutic hemoglobin production and correction of anemia in beta-thalassemic mice. Several groups have by now replicated and extended these findings to various mouse models of severe hemoglobinopathies, thus fueling enthusiasm for a potential treatment of beta-thalassemia based on globin gene transfer. Current investigation focuses on safety issues and the need for improved vector production methodologies. The safe implementation of stem cell-based gene therapy requires the prevention of the formation of replication-competent viral genomes and minimization of the risk of insertional oncogenesis. Importantly, globin vectors, in which transcriptional activity is highly restricted, have a lesser risk of activating oncogenes in hematopoietic progenitors than non-tissue-specific vectors, by virtue of their late-stage erythroid specificity. As such, they provide a general paradigm for improving vector safety in stem cell-based gene therapy.","['Sadelain, Michel', 'Lisowski, Leszek', 'Samakoglu, Selda', 'Rivella, Stefano', 'May, Chad', 'Riviere, Isabelle']","['Sadelain M', 'Lisowski L', 'Samakoglu S', 'Rivella S', 'May C', 'Riviere I']","['Gene Transfer and Gene Expression Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Box 182, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY 10021, USA. m-sadelain@ski.mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy/adverse effects', 'Genetic Vectors/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology', 'Locus Control Region/genetics', 'Metalloproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/therapy', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transgenes', 'beta-Thalassemia/*therapy']",97,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/07/14 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1054/1/78 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1345.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005;1054:78-91. doi: 10.1196/annals.1345.010.,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL57612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL66952/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GATA-1 is essential for the erythroid differentiation, its functions encompassing upregulation of erythroid genes, repression of alternative transcription programs, and suppression of cell proliferation. However, it was not clear how all of these GATA-1 functions are mediated.

We also provide evidence that distinct GATA-1 complexes are associated with specific GATA-1 functions in erythroid differentiation, for example, GATA-1/Gfi-1b with the suppression of cell proliferation and GATA-1/FOG-1/MeCP1 with the repression of other hematopoietic transcription programs. We next applied the biotinylation tag to Ldb-1, a known partner of GATA-1, and characterized a number of novel interaction partners that are essential in erythroid development, in particular, Eto-2, Lmo4, and CdK9.

Because Rac1 is a component of the reactive oxidant species (ROS)-generating NADPH oxidase system, we investigated the role of this GTPase in ROS production in HCs. In this study, we show that ROS production in HCs involves a flavin-containing oxidase dependent on Ca2+, but not on GTP-Rac1 or protein kinase C. This suggests the involvement of the nonphagocytic NADPH oxidase NOX5, an enzyme found in lymphoid tissues, but not in circulating lymphocytes. By using RT-PCR and Southern and Western blotting and by measuring superoxide anion production in membrane fractions in the absence of cytosolic components, we demonstrate for the first time that HCs (but not circulating normal B cells or some other lymphoid cell types) express NOX5. We also demonstrate that inhibition of NADPH oxidase in HCs results in a selective increase in the activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1). Furthermore, SHP-1 in HCs coimmunoprecipitates with tyrosine phosphorylated CD22 and localizes in the same cellular compartment as NOX5. This allows the inactivation of SHP-1 by NOX5-generated ROS and contributes to the maintenance of the constitutive activation of HCs.","['Kamiguti, Aura S', 'Serrander, Lena', 'Lin, Ke', 'Harris, Robert J', 'Cawley, John C', 'Allsup, David J', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Krause, Karl-Heinz', 'Zuzel, Mirko']","['Kamiguti AS', 'Serrander L', 'Lin K', 'Harris RJ', 'Cawley JC', 'Allsup DJ', 'Slupsky JR', 'Krause KH', 'Zuzel M']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Liverpool Hospital, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. aurakami@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Calcium', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 5', 'NADPH Oxidases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*chemistry', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/metabolism', 'Superoxides/analysis/metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/23 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['175/12/8424 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.175.12.8424 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Dec 15;175(12):8424-30. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.175.12.8424.,,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 5)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NOX5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individually recognized IgE Ab-binding epitopes, amino acid positions, and substitutions critical for IgE Ab binding were identified by combinatorial substitution analysis, and 12 positions deemed critical were mutated in the eight major epitopes. The mutant VR9-1 was characterized with regard to allergenic potency by mediator release assays using sera from shrimp-allergic subjects and sera from BALB/c, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and CBA/J mice sensitized with shrimp extract using alum, cholera toxin, and Bordetella pertussis, as adjuvants. The secondary structure of VR9-1 was not altered; however, the allergenic potency was reduced by 90-98% measuring allergen-specific mediator release from humanized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, RBL 30/25. Reduced mediator release of RBL-2H3 cells sensitized with sera from mice that were immunized with shrimp extract indicated that mice produced IgE Abs to Pen a 1 and to the same epitopes as humans did. In conclusion, data obtained by mapping sequential epitopes were used to generate a Pen a 1 mutant with significantly reduced allergenic potency. Epitopes that are relevant for human IgE Ab binding are also major binding sites for murine IgE Abs.

Mcl-1 was critical for the survival of RA synovial fibroblasts, because the forced reduction of Mcl-1 using a Mcl-1 antisense-expressing adenoviral vector induced apoptotic cell death, which was mediated through Bax, Bak, and Bim.

Somatic hypermutations in rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgVH) genes allow a division of CLL patients into 2 categories: mutated IgVH genes are associated with an indolent disease, whereas unmutated IgVH genes define an aggressive form. Using differential display to compare gene expression in CLL cells with and without IgVH hypermutations, we identified a novel gene, CLL up-regulated gene 1 (CLLU1), that was highly up-regulated in CLL cells without IgVH hypermutations. CLLU1 mapped to chromosome 12q22, within a cluster of genes that are active in germinal center B cells. However, appreciable levels of CLLU1 were detectable only in CLL cells and not in a panel of normal tissue extracts or in any other tested hematologic malignancy. High expression of CLLU1 in CLL samples occurred irrespective of trisomy 12 or large chromosomal rearrangements. CLLU1 encodes 6 mRNAs with no sequence homology to any known gene, and most transcripts appear to be noncoding. Two transcripts, however, potentially encode a peptide with remarkable structural similarity to human interleukin 4.

We have searched for genes that are overexpressed in human cancer and also show specific patterns of tissue-dependent expression in normal tissues. Using the expression data of the normal tissues, we identified 4,346 genes with a high variability of expression and clustered these genes according to their relative expression level. Of 91 stable clusters obtained, 24 clusters included genes preferentially expressed either only in hematopoietic tissues or in hematopoietic and one to two other tissues; 28 clusters included genes preferentially expressed in various nonhematopoietic tissues such as neuronal, testis, liver, kidney, muscle, lung, pancreas, and placenta. Analysis of the expression levels of these two groups of genes in the human cancer cell lines and leukemias identified genes that were highly expressed in cancer cells but not in their normal counterparts and, thus, were overexpressed in the cancers. The different cancer cell lines and leukemias varied in the number and identity of these overexpressed genes. The results indicate that many genes that are overexpressed in human cancer cells are specific to a variety of normal tissues, including normal tissues other than those from which the cancer originated.

Securin, a proposed proto-oncogene, regulates cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, roles of securin on the arsenic-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis remain unknown. In this study, the effects of sodium arsenite on the expression of securin in two tissue types of cell lines, the vascular endothelial and colorectal epithelial cells, were investigated. Arsenite (8-16 microM, 24 h) increased the cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and growth inhibition in both endothelial and epithelial cells. The levels of phospho-CDC2 (threonine-161), CDC2, and cyclin B1 proteins were decreased, and the G2/M fractions were increased by arsenite. Concomitantly, arsenite markedly diminished the securin protein expression and induced the abnormal sister chromatid separation. The depletion of securin proteins increased the induction of mitotic arrest, aberrant chromosome segregation, and apoptosis after arsenite treatment. p53, a tumor suppressor protein, balances the cell survival and apoptosis. Arsenite raised the levels of phospho-p53 (serine-15) and p53 (DO-1) proteins in both the securin-wild-type and -null cells. The p53-functional cells were more susceptible than the p53-mutational cells to arsenite on the cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Besides, arsenite decreased the levels of securin proteins to a similar degree in both the p53-functional and -mutational cells. Together, it is the first time to demonstrate that the inhibition of securin expression induced by arsenite increases the chromosomal instability and apoptosis via a p53-independent pathway.","['Chao, Jui-I', 'Hsu, Shih-Hsin', 'Tsou, Tsui-Chun']","['Chao JI', 'Hsu SH', 'Tsou TC']","['Molecular Anticancer Laboratory, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Life Sciences, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan. chaoji@mail.tcu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenites/*toxicity', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Securin', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*drug effects', 'Sodium Compounds/*toxicity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/31 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['kfj070 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfj070 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2006 Mar;90(1):73-86. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfj070.

To evaluate this clinically, we investigated whether high levels of circulating IL-12 in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are associated with improved relapse-free survival. We prospectively studied 134 patients undergoing HSCT. Median follow-up was 1158 days (range, 70-1792 days). Plasma IL-12 levels were measured before transplantation and on days 0, +4, +7, and +14 after transplantation. The highest levels were seen on days +4 and +7 and were categorized by a cluster analysis of the logarithmically transformed IL-12 concentrations, which were then correlated with relapse-free survival. Forty-six patients had low levels of IL-12 (median, 2 pg/mL; range, 0-6.5 pg/mL), 49 patients had medium levels (median, 20.5 pg/mL; range, 7-75.5 pg/mL), and 25 patients had high levels (median, 181 pg/mL; range, 84-623 pg/mL). Patients with high IL-12 levels before transplantation had the highest increase after transplantation. With a multivariate Cox model for relapse onset, with the low IL-12 level as the reference, patients in the high-IL-12 group had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.79), and medium group patients had a hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.36). The incidences of relapse at 500 days by Kaplan-Meier analysis by IL-12 group were 23.0% (high group), 40.3% (medium group), and 48.8% (low group). There was no association between IL-12 levels and the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; P = .51) or chronic GVHD (P = .28). In conclusion, high IL-12 levels after HSCT are associated with improved relapse-free survival without increasing the risk for GVHD. Patients with high pretransplantation IL-12 levels have an increased likelihood of higher posttransplantation IL-12 levels, possibly because of a host-graft interaction, and this may predispose to better clinical outcomes.","['Reddy, Vijay', 'Winer, Andrew G', 'Eksioglu, Erika', 'Meier-Kriesche, Herwig-Ulf', 'Schold, Jesse D', 'Wingard, John R']","['Reddy V', 'Winer AG', 'Eksioglu E', 'Meier-Kriesche HU', 'Schold JD', 'Wingard JR']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA. reddyvs@medicine.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*blood/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*blood', 'Leukemia/*blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/06/08 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)00500-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.08.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Dec;11(12):1014-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.08.032.,,['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies, however, included small and heterogeneous study populations, and not all considered bidirectional ABO incompatibility separately. Because the issue remains controversial, we analyzed the effect of ABO mismatch on the overall survival, transplant-related mortality, and occurrence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a large homogenous group of patients undergoing allogeneic BMT. A total of 3103 patients with early-stage leukemia who underwent transplantation between 1990 and 1998 with bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling and who were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research were studied. The median follow-up was 54 months. A total of 2108 (67.9%) donor-recipient pairs were ABO identical, 451 (14.5%) had a minor mismatch, 430 (13.9%) had a major mismatch, and 114 (3.7%) had a bidirectional ABO mismatch. The groups did not differ significantly in patient or donor characteristics except for more female-to-male sex mismatch in the bidirectional ABO mismatch group (P = .017). In multivariate models of overall survival, transplant-related mortality, and grade II to IV acute GVHD, there were no significant differences among the 4 groups. Bidirectional ABO mismatch was associated with a significantly higher risk of grade III or IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio, 1.869; 95% confidence interval, 1.192-2.93; P = .006). Patients with major ABO mismatch received red blood cell transfusions (P = .001) for a longer timer after transplantation and had a slightly slower neutrophil recovery (P < .001).

A subset of these infants, particularly those with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangements, has a high likelihood of relapse.

We present the results of 16 patients with infant ALL who were treated with HSCT in first remission. Six patients were < or =6 months of age at diagnosis, 11 had an initial white blood cell count of >50000/microL, and all patients with determinable cytogenetics had a high-risk karyotype [t(4:11) abnormality or other MLL rearrangement]. All patients received 150 cGy of total body irradiation for 8 doses (1200 cGy). Fifteen of 16 patients received etoposide at 1000 mg/m(2) as a continuous infusion over 24 hours and cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/d for 3 days. Eight patients received HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling, and 8, from unrelated cord blood. Twelve (75%) patients remain long-term survivors (median follow-up, 4.7 years). Two patients, 1 of whom had minimal residual disease at HSCT, died after relapse following HSCT. Two patients died of transplant-related causes. The HSCT was well tolerated; 15 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 16 days. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were minimal in these patients. These results support the use of HSCT in the treatment of infant ALL, especially when used as consolidation in first remission. The risk of relapse seems to be decreased with this approach.

Characteristics of US HSCT centers according to the proportion of ethnic minorities who undergo transplantation were compared to explore systematic differences among centers; the association with 100-day mortality was evaluated to determine whether center factors may explain the observed discrepant survival among ethnic minorities. One hundred sixteen US transplantation centers that performed HLA-identical sibling transplantations for leukemia were analyzed. We compared physician and health care provider staffing, transplantation unit procedure and resources, and medical center organization according to the volume procedure ratio of ethnic minorities who underwent transplantation and also according to the ratio of Hispanics who underwent transplantation. Centers that performed transplantation in a higher proportion of ethnic minorities were more likely to perform fewer transplantations per year, to have fewer devoted transplant beds, to be in an urban setting, to have a lower physician to patient volume ratio, and to follow up survivors 1 year after transplantation. Centers that performed transplantation in a higher proportion of Hispanics were more likely to perform fewer transplantations per year and to have fewer devoted transplantation beds, were less likely to perform outpatient transplantations, were more likely to be in an urban setting, and were less likely to have posttransplantation immunization protocols. Observed differences in center factors were not associated with 100-day mortality after adjustment for disease severity.

AML-derived dendritic cells (AML-DCs) have better antigen-presentation capacity than undifferentiated leukemic blasts, but may not be fully competent to stimulate T cells previously inhibited by leukemic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML-DCs were generated from AML cells and used to stimulate proliferation and cytokine production by T cells previously inhibited by AML cells. AML-DCs were also transfected with interleukin (IL)-12 gene by the nonviral method, nucleofection. RESULTS: Mature AML-DCs stimulated naive and, to a lesser extent, leukemic cell (LC)-cultured T cells more efficiently than their immature counterparts and their activity was mediated by IL-12. AML-DCs generated from CD14(-) AML samples (which represent 80% of total AML patients) were defective in IL-12 production and T-cell activation. Addition of exogenous IL-12 to LC-cultured T cells stimulated by CD14(-)-derived AML-DCs restored optimal interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production and Th1 skewing. IL-12 gene-nucleofected AML-DCs derived from CD14(-) cells produced significant amounts of IL-12, maintained leukemia-specific karyotype, DC-like phenotype, and function. When stimulated by IL-12-gene transduced CD14(-)-derived AML-DCs, LC-cultured T cells produced higher concentrations of IFN-gamma, thus maintaining a Th1 cytokine profile. CONCLUSION: IL-12 produced by AML-DCs plays a critical role in counteracting the inhibitory activity of LCs on T-cell function. IL-12 gene can be successfully expressed into AML-DCs defective in endogenous IL-12 production by using a novel nonviral method that does not modify their phenotypical, cytogenetic, and functional features. Genetically modified AML-DCs restore a near normal T-cell function.","['Curti, Antonio', 'Pandolfi, Simona', 'Aluigi, Michela', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Alessandrini, Isabella', 'Chiodoni, Claudia', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Colombo, Mario P', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Lemoli, Roberto M']","['Curti A', 'Pandolfi S', 'Aluigi M', 'Isidori A', 'Alessandrini I', 'Chiodoni C', 'Testoni N', 'Colombo MP', 'Baccarani M', 'Lemoli RM']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. & A.

This study addresses the expression of CD27 and its ligand, CD70, in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the possible role of this receptor-ligand pair in the pathogenesis of ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of CD27 and CD70 was evaluated with three-color flow cytometry in blood and bone marrow (BM) samples in children with ALL and controls. The biological role of these molecules on leukemic cell proliferation was studied in an in vitro culture system. RESULTS: The expression of the membrane bound CD27, as well as membrane bound CD70, on CD19(+) cells in the BM was significantly increased in ALL children compared to the expression found in the controls. Importantly, a substantial reduction in the in vitro proliferation of leukemic cells could be observed when the leukemic cells were cultured in presence of a blocking anti-human CD70 monoclonal antibody. The level of soluble CD27 (sCD27) in serum was also investigated and found to be significantly elevated in leukemic children as compared to healthy children. CONCLUSION: The high expression of CD27 and CD70 on ALL cells may represent an amplification of the normal CD27-CD70 expression present on early B cell progenitors. Our finding suggests that interference with CD27-CD70 interaction may represent novel treatment opportunities in ALL. Further studies are required to pin-point the role of this receptor-ligand pair in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Nilsson, Anna', 'de Milito, Angelo', 'Mowafi, Frida', 'Winberg, Gosta', 'Bjork, Olle', 'Wolpert, Elisabeth Z', 'Chiodi, Francesca']","['Nilsson A', 'de Milito A', 'Mowafi F', 'Winberg G', 'Bjork O', 'Wolpert EZ', 'Chiodi F']","['Pediatric Cancer Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

To understand the mechanisms of gene regulation in the trophoblast cell lineage we have used the murine adenosine deaminase gene (Ada) as a model. Ada is highly expressed in trophoblast cells of the placenta and is critical for embryo development. A 770bp fragment of the mouse Ada 5' flanking region is capable of directing trophoblast cell-specific expression in a transgenic model system. Earlier studies identified several critical portions of this fragment, including three footprinting regions that are necessary for correct gene expression in the placenta. Using electromobility shift assays (EMSA), we identified a 5bp sequence within footprint 3 that computer databases predicted bound to the transcription factor RUNX1 (also known as acute myeloid leukemia 1). This prediction was confirmed by supershift analysis using antibodies specific for RUNX1. The functional importance of this binding was demonstrated by both transient transfections and transgenic approaches. A significant reduction in expression of the reporter gene in the placenta was seen when the 5bp RUNX1 binding site was mutated. The findings reported here indicate that the RUNX1 transcription factor plays a significant role in regulating Ada gene expression in the trophoblast cell lineage.","['Schaubach, B M', 'Wen, H Y', 'Kellems, R E']","['Schaubach BM', 'Wen HY', 'Kellems RE']","['University of Texas at Houston, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 6431 Fannin, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Placenta,Placenta,8006349,IM,"[""5' Flanking Region"", 'Adenosine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/analysis/*metabolism', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Placenta/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/*metabolism']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0143-4004(05)00113-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.placenta.2005.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Placenta. 2006 Feb-Mar;27(2-3):269-77. doi: 10.1016/j.placenta.2005.03.001.,"['DK46207/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HD34130/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene encoding Dok1 maps to human chromosome 2p13, which is frequently rearranged in human tumors.

In this study, we have determined the expression levels of Dok1 in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines, lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP-LCL), or from control healthy donors. We have also screened for Dok1 gene mutations by heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing. Dok1 expression was down-regulated in all BL and XLP-LCL cell lines in comparison to the control cells. No Dok1 mutation or polymorphism was found in the coding region of Dok1 in the three types of cells.

These findings suggest a fail-safe escape mechanism by virus-infected cells for escape from CTL-mediated immunity.","['Rich, Robert F', 'Cook, W James', 'Green, William R']","['Rich RF', 'Cook WJ', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, 1 Medical Center Drive, Borwell 603 West, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/virology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/immunology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/physiology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00657-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 Mar 15;346(2):287-300. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.10.009.

In most cases, it is cytogenetically visualized as a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, known as the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation. About 5-10% of CML patients lack cytogenetic evidence of the Ph translocation but show BCR/ABL fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Deletions around the breakpoints on the derivative 9 including ABL and or BCR sequences occur in 10-15% of Ph+ CML patients and are thought to have prognostic significance. We describe two patients with CML and normal karyotype in whom cryptic rearrangements involving chromosomes 9 and 22 resulted in the causative BCR/ABL gene. FISH with a three-color probe combination revealed BCR/ABL fusion on chromosome 9 without deletion in one patient; the other patient had BCR/ABL on chromosome 22 with an associated derivative 9 deletion. We discuss the proposed mechanisms in the formation of BCR/ABL in the setting of a normal karyotype. Some authors reported that patients with the chimeric gene located on the derivative 9 have a poor clinical course.

Peripheral blood smears and bone marrow aspirate smears at presentation revealed blastic cells, which were generally L2 shaped, with variation in cell size, round to moderately irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, pale cytoplasm, and a lack of azurophilic granules. Immunophenotypic analysis of the blasts displayed coexpression of myeloid and natural killer cell antigens with relatively immature phenotype: CD7+, CD33+, CD34+, CD56+, CD57+, CD16-, MPO-. Cytogenetic analysis of marrow cells showed 62% of cells with a normal female karyotype; in the remaining 38%, tetraploid changes were detected, where the chromosome number was 92, with no preferential losses or gains of chromosomes.

Viability of HL-60 treated with 12.5 microM halocynthiaxanthin and fucoxanthinol was decreased by 12.1% and 5.7% of control after 48 h incubation, respectively. Furthermore, halocynthiaxanthin and fucoxanthinol induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and Caco-2 human colon cancer cells. When HL-60 cells were incubated with 12.5 microM halocynthiaxanthin and fucoxanthinol for 48 h, relative DNA fragmentations were enhanced to 5- and 7-fold compared to that in control cells, respectively. The activities of apoptosis induction by halocynthiaxanthin and fucoxanthinol were higher than that of fucoxanthin which we have previously reported as a carotenoid possessing the ability to induce apoptosis. Fucoxanthinol exhibited the highest apoptosis-inducing activity among the three carotenoids. Furthermore, the expression levels of apoptosis-suppressing protein Bcl-2 were decreased in HL-60 cells treated with halocynthiaxanthin and fucoxanthinol.

II. An inter-laboratory study of the h-CLAT.,774-84,"Recent regulatory changes have placed a major emphasis on in vitro safety testing and alternative models. In regard to skin sensitization tests, dendritic cells (DCs) derived from human peripheral blood have been considered in the development of new in vitro alternatives. Human cell lines have been also reported recently. In our previous study, we suggested that measuring CD86 and/or CD54 expression on THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line) could be used as an in vitro skin sensitization method. An inter-laboratory study among two laboratories was undertaken in Japan in order to further develop an in vitro skin sensitization model. In the present study, we used two human cell lines: THP-1 and U-937 (human histiocytic lymphoma cell line). First we optimized our test protocol (refer to the related paper entitled ""optimization of the h-CLAT protocol"" within this journal) and then we did an inter-laboratory validation with nine chemicals using the optimized protocol. We measured the expression of CD86 and CD54 on the above cells using flow cytometry after a 24h and 48h exposure to six known allergens (e.g., DNCB, pPD, NiSO(4)) and three non-allergens (e.g., SLS, tween 80). For the sample test concentration, four doses (0.1x, 0.5x, 1x, and 2x of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50))) were evaluated. IC(50) was calculated using MTT assay. We found that allergens/non-allergens were better predicted using THP-1 cells compared to U-937 cells following a 24 h and a 48 h exposure. We also found that the 24h treatment time tended to have a better accuracy than the 48 h treatment time for THP-1 cells. Expression of CD86 and CD54 were good predictive markers for THP-1 cells, but for U-937 cells, expression of CD86 was a better predictor than CD54, at the 24h and the 48 h treatment time.

Both laboratories gave a good prediction of allergen/non-allergen, especially using THP-1 cells.

METHODS: We studied nineteen patients (eleven men and eight women; mean age 30.1 +/- 11.2, 27.9 +/- 7.1 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. Cystatin C, urea, creatinine and creatinine clearance (CrCl) were measured 24 h before BMT, 1 week after BMT, 2 weeks after BMT and 3 weeks after BMT. The control group consisted of twenty healthy adults, and the mean age was 29.1 +/- 8.9. RESULTS: At the pretransplantation period, values of cystatin C were significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). Urea, creatinine and CrCl values were not statistically different from the controls. One week after BMT, the level of cystatin C was significantly low as compared to the levels measured 24 h before BMT, but was still significantly higher than the controls (P < 0.05), whereas the levels of urea, creatinine and CrCl were in accordance with the levels of the controls. Two and three weeks after BMT, cystatin C values maintained the significant increase (P < 0.05), whereas the values of urea, creatinine and CrCl still corresponded with those of the controls in both group. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data expose that cystatin C is not a reliable GFR marker in patients during leukemia or for monitoring nephrotoxic drugs used in BMT, but we can not reach definitive conclusion due to no gold standard for comparing the diagnostic accuracy of cystatin C. Further study is needed to elucidate the precise mechanism underlying this observation.","['Demirtas, Selda', 'Akan, Ozay', 'Can, Murat', 'Elmali, Esra', 'Akan, Hamdi']","['Demirtas S', 'Akan O', 'Can M', 'Elmali E', 'Akan H']","['University of Ufuk, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Amikacin/therapeutic use', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Cystatin C', 'Cystatins/*blood', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate']",,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-9120(05)00294-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2006 Feb;39(2):115-8. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.10.009.

Expression of intracellular oncogenic kinase BCR/Abl, myeloid cell surface antigen CD33, human stem cell factor receptor c-Kit and integrin receptor VLA-4 were investigated using model human leukemia cell lines. Antigens to which specific antibodies are available and are distinguishably tagged can be determined simultaneously, or multiplexed.

Results obtained by ICP-MS were compared with data from FACS. ICP-MS as an analytical detector possesses several advantages that enhance the performance of immunoassays, which are discussed in detail.

Morpholino knockdown of Etsrp protein function resulted in the complete absence of circulation in zebrafish embryos. Angioblasts in etsrp-morpholino-injected embryos (morphants) failed to undergo migration and differentiation and did not coalesce into functional blood vessels. Expression of all vascular endothelial molecular markers tested was severely reduced in etsrp morphants, whereas hematopoietic markers were not affected. Overexpression of etsrp RNA caused multiple cell types to express vascular endothelial markers. etsrp RNA restored expression of vascular markers in cloche mutants, defective in hematopoietic and endothelial cell formation, arguing that etsrp functions downstream of cloche in angioblast formation. etsrp gene function was also required for endothelial marker induction by the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) and stem cell leukemia (scl/tal1).

Both leukemic and normal cells were positive for cyclin D3 expression. Significant differences were found in the expression of cyclin D1, which was the highest in leukocytes (CD19 + ) of CLL patients whereas lower expression was found in CML, AML and ALL patients and normal bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocytes (P < 0.001). The higher expression of cyclin D1 in leukocytes of CLL patients compared to CML patients was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with a TaqMan probe in a subset of CLL and CML patients. Differences in cyclin D1 expression between CLL and CML patients were also confirmed on protein levels by western blotting. Expression of the proliferative marker Ki-67 was high in CML, ALL and AML cells and low in CD19-positive CLL cells.

The present study, conducted between 1993 and 2003 in children with AML, sought to assess the frequency and characteristics of infectious complications (ICs), the incidence of VGS sepsis, the interest of preventive decontamination, and a possible cytarabine dose-effect on the occurrence of ICs. METHODS: Medical charts of 78 children treated according to the EORTC 58921 clinical trial were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were isolated in laminar air flow rooms, received non-absorbable gut decontamination, gum decontamination with vancomycin mouthwash, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole. ICs were categorized as microbiologically documented infections (MDI), clinically documented infections (CDI), or fever of unknown origin (FUO). RESULTS: Overall, 268 ICs occurred: 57.5% FUO, 8.5% CDI, and 34% MDI. Bloodstream infections occurred in 58 febrile episodes: Gram-positive bacteria represented 83% of the pathogens including 66.1% Staphylococcus species and 8.5% Streptococcus species (6.8% VGS), Gram-negative bacteria represented 13.5% of the pathogens and yeasts 3.5%. Five patients died of infection (6.4%). None died from bacterial infection and no case of VGS sepsis required intensive care. Invasive fungal infection was proven in four patients. Number of ICs was significantly different according to gum and gut decontamination status, and according to the cytarabine dose during the first intensification. No resistant strains were detected in spite of the use of local antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The low rate of VGS and enterobacteriaceae sepsis was probably due to the effective decontamination. Our supportive care strategy could potentially help enhance overall survival in children with AML.","['Brunet, A S', 'Ploton, C', 'Galambrun, C', 'Pondarre, C', 'Pages, M P', 'Bleyzac, N', 'Freydiere, A M', 'Barbe, G', 'Bertrand, Y']","['Brunet AS', 'Ploton C', 'Galambrun C', 'Pondarre C', 'Pages MP', 'Bleyzac N', 'Freydiere AM', 'Barbe G', 'Bertrand Y']","['Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Debrousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infection Control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/*complications/drug therapy', 'Streptococcal Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology/prevention & control', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viridans Streptococci/*drug effects']",,2005/12/08 09:00,2007/02/14 09:00,['2005/12/08 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20706 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Nov;47(6):765-72. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20706.,,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

We analyzed the features and outcome of neonatal leukemia in Japan to establish an appropriate treatment strategy for this rare disorder. PROCEDURE: Patients with infant leukemia registered and treated in the Japan Infant Leukemia Study between 1996 and 2001 were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 162 infant leukemia patients, 11 exhibited neonatal leukemia; frequencies for all infant leukemias were 6.9% (8/116) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 7.3% (3/41) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Positive MLL gene rearrangement was observed in all eight patients with ALL; a single patient with AML displayed germline configuration. Acute monoblastic leukemia was apparent in all three patients with AML (M5a in the FAB classification). Most of the patients demonstrated hepatoplenomegaly and hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis. Cutaneous and central nervous system involvement were detected in half of the patients.

METHODS: We used an HPLC method to measure the IMPDH activity in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC). IMPDH activities were determined in children who were diagnosed with and treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and in a group of control children. RESULTS: The median IMPDH activity for control children was 350 pmol/10(6) pMNC/hr (range 97-896; n = 47). No gender or age differences were observed. IMPDH activity at diagnosis of ALL was correlated with the percentage of peripheral blood lymphoblasts (r = 0.474; P < 0.001; n = 71). The median IMPDH activity at diagnosis was 410 pmol/10(6) pMNC/hr (range 40-2009; n = 76), significantly higher than for controls (P = 0.012). IMPDH activity significantly decreased after induction treatment, and during treatment with methotrexate (MTX) infusions (median 174 pmol/10(6) pMNC/hr; range 52-516; n = 21). The activity remained low during maintenance treatment with 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and MTX, at a significantly lower level than for controls (P < 0.004). One year after cessation of treatment IMPDH activity returned to normal values. CONCLUSION: The decrease of IMPDH activity at remission of ALL seems to be at least partly due to the eradication of lymphoblasts with the type 2 isoform of the enzyme.","['Brouwer, Connie', 'Vermunt-de Koning, Diana G M', 'Trueworthy, Robert C', 'Ter Riet, Patricia G J H', 'Duley, John A', 'Trijbels, Frans J M', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Bokkerink, Jos P M', 'van Wering, Elisabeth R', 'De Abreu, Ronney A']","['Brouwer C', 'Vermunt-de Koning DG', 'Trueworthy RC', 'Ter Riet PG', 'Duley JA', 'Trijbels FJ', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Bokkerink JP', 'van Wering ER', 'De Abreu RA']","['Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Medical Center St. Radboud, HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*enzymology/therapy']",,2005/12/08 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2005/12/08 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20452 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Apr;46(4):434-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20452.,,['EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the dynamics of MP on the cell cycle, we incubated human T-cell leukaemia cell lines (Molt-4 sensitive and resistant subline and P12 resistant) with 10 microM MP and measured total cell count, cell cycle distribution, percent viable, percent apoptotic, and percent dead cells serially over 72 h. We developed a mathematical model of the cell cycle dynamics after treatment with MP and used it to show that the Molt-4 sensitive controls had a significantly higher rate of cells entering apoptosis (2.7-fold, P<0.00001) relative to the resistant cell lines. Additionally, when treated with MP, the sensitive cell line showed a significant increase in the rate at which cells enter apoptosis compared to its controls (2.4-fold, P<0.00001). Of note, the resistant cell lines had a higher rate of antimetabolite incorporation into the DNA of viable cells (>1.4-fold, P<0.01). Lastly, in contrast to the other cell lines, the Molt-4 resistant subline continued to cycle, though at a rate slower relative to its control, rather than proceed to apoptosis. This led to a larger S-phase block in the Molt-4 resistant cell line, but not a higher rate of cell death. Gene expression of apoptosis, cell cycle, and repair genes were consistent with mechanistic dynamics described by the model.

Aberrant expression of enzymes involved in the transport/metabolism of ara-C could explain drug resistance. We determined mRNA expression of these factors using quantitative-real-time-PCR in leukemic blasts from children diagnosed with de novo AML. Expression of the inactivating enzyme pyrimidine nucleotidase-I (PN-I) was 1.8-fold lower in FAB-M5 as compared to FAB-M1/2 (P=0.007). In vitro sensitivity to deoxynucleoside analogues was determined using the MTT-assay. Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) mRNA expression and ara-C sensitivity were significantly correlated (rp=-0.46; P=0.001), with three-fold lower hENT1 mRNA levels in resistant patients (P=0.003). hENT1 mRNA expression also seemed to correlate inversely with the LC50 values of cladribine (rp=-0.30; P=0.04), decitabine (rp=-0.29; P=0.04) and gemcitabine (rp=-0.33; P=0.02).

The dCK/PN-I ratio correlated inversely with LC50 values for gemcitabine (rp=-0.45, P=0.001) and the dCK/CDA ratio seemed to correlate with LC50 values for decitabine (rp=-0.29; 0.04). In conclusion, decreased expression of hENT1, which transports ara-C across the cell membrane, appears to be a major factor in ara-C resistance in childhood AML.","['Hubeek, I', 'Stam, R W', 'Peters, G J', 'Broekhuizen, R', 'Meijerink, J P P', 'van Wering, E R', 'Gibson, B E S', 'Creutzig, U', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Cloos, J', 'Kuik, D J', 'Pieters, R', 'Kaspers, G J L']","['Hubeek I', 'Stam RW', 'Peters GJ', 'Broekhuizen R', 'Meijerink JP', 'van Wering ER', 'Gibson BE', 'Creutzig U', 'Zwaan CM', 'Cloos J', 'Kuik DJ', 'Pieters R', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, Postbus 7057, 1007 MB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. isabelle.hubeek@vumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/12/08 09:00,2006/01/26 09:00,['2005/12/08 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602881 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602881 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2005 Dec 12;93(12):1388-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602881.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,PMC2361532,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using various human cancer and nonmalignant cell lines, we investigated the anticancer activity and selectivity of OSW-1 and its underlying mechanisms of action. OSW-1 exhibited extremely potent cytotoxic activity against cancer cells in vitro. Nonmalignant cells were statistically significantly less sensitive to OSW-1 than cancer cells, with concentrations that cause a 50% loss of cell viability 40-150-fold greater than those observed in malignant cells. Electron microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that OSW-1 damaged the mitochondrial membrane and cristae in both human leukemia and pancreatic cancer cells, leading to the loss of transmembrane potential, increase of cytosolic calcium, and activation of calcium-dependent apoptosis. Clones of leukemia cells with mitochondrial DNA defects and respiration deficiency that had adapted the ability to survive in culture without mitochondrial respiration also were resistant to OSW-1. In vitro analysis revealed that OSW-1 effectively killed primary leukemia cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with disease refractory to fludarabine. The promising anticancer activity of OSW-1 and its unique mechanism of action make this compound worthy of further investigation for its potential to overcome drug resistance.","['Zhou, Yan', 'Garcia-Prieto, Celia', 'Carney, Dennis A', 'Xu, Rui-hua', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Kang, Ying', 'Yu, Wensheng', 'Lou, Changgang', 'Kondo, Seiji', 'Liu, Jinsong', 'Harris, David M', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Jin, Zhendong', 'Huang, Peng']","['Zhou Y', 'Garcia-Prieto C', 'Carney DA', 'Xu RH', 'Pelicano H', 'Kang Y', 'Yu W', 'Lou C', 'Kondo S', 'Liu J', 'Harris DM', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating MJ', 'Jin Z', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: A total of 1214 patients with early-stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of FEC14 (604 patients) or of FEC21 (610 patients). Study endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival. Associations were assessed by multivariable analysis with adjustment for age; tumor size; grade; proliferative rate; and menopausal, lymph node, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Patients in the FEC14 arm had fewer dose reductions or treatment delays or discontinuation (26%) than those in the FEC21 arm (33%) (difference = 7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2% to 12%; P = .008). FEC14 therapy, compared with FEC21 therapy, was associated with more asthenia (36% versus 29%, difference = 7%, 95% CI = 2% to 12%; P = .01), bone pain (33% versus 4%, difference = 29%, 95% CI = 25% to 33%; P < .001), anemia (38% versus 19%, difference = 19%, 95% CI = 14% to 24%; P < .001), and thrombocytopenia (8% versus 2%, difference = 6%, 95% CI = 4% to 9%; P < .001), but with less leukopenia (12% versus 45%, difference = 33%, 95% CI = 28% to 37%; P < .001). No acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome was observed. At a median follow-up of 10.4 years, no statistically significant difference in the hazard of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.13) or recurrence (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.08) was found between FEC14 and FEC21 groups after adjustment by multivariable analysis. Although the study was underpowered for subset analysis, we found no evidence that the effect of the treatment type was associated with any of the potential prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Our results support the long-term safety of FEC14 chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. However, this therapy was not associated with improved outcome, but because of the limited statistical power of our study, we cannot rule out a modest improvement in outcome associated with FEC14 therapy.","['Venturini, Marco', 'Del Mastro, Lucia', 'Aitini, Enrico', 'Baldini, Editta', 'Caroti, Cinzia', 'Contu, Antonio', 'Testore, Franco', 'Brema, Fulvio', 'Pronzato, Paolo', 'Cavazzini, Giovanna', 'Sertoli, Mario Roberto', 'Canavese, Giuseppe', 'Rosso, Riccardo', 'Bruzzi, Paolo']","['Venturini M', 'Del Mastro L', 'Aitini E', 'Baldini E', 'Caroti C', 'Contu A', 'Testore F', 'Brema F', 'Pronzato P', 'Cavazzini G', 'Sertoli MR', 'Canavese G', 'Rosso R', 'Bruzzi P']","['Institution of Oncologia Medica, Sperimentazioni Cliniche Controllate Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova (PB), Italy. marco.venturini@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Italy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/12/08 09:00,2005/12/16 09:00,['2005/12/08 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['97/23/1724 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/dji398 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Dec 7;97(23):1724-33. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dji398.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'FEC protocol']",['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Dec 7;97(23):1712-4.

These may be pathogenetic because of the coincidental expression of ZAP-70 and increased B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the signaling function of CD38 in CLL. This study shows that ZAP-70(+) CLL B cells respond in vitro more readily than ZAP-70(-) CLL and normal B cells to chemokine migratory signals through enhanced surface CCR7 expression (P = .009; P < .001) and increased responsiveness to its ligands CCL19 and CCL21, demonstrated by F-actin polymerization (P < .05) and cellular migration (P < .01). In addition, ZAP-70(+) CLL cells exhibit sustained ERK phosphorylation/activation following stimulation with CXCL12 (SDF1-alpha, a survival factor produced by stromal cells) compared with ZAP-70(-) cells (P = .004). Following coculture with nurse-like cells, the survival of ZAP-70(+) but not ZAP-70(-) CLL cells is significantly enhanced by the addition of CXCL12 (P < .05), an effect that is partially blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. These advantageous migratory and survival responses may promote easier access to and greater proliferation in pseudo-germinal centers and explain in part the more progressive nature of ZAP-70(+) disease.","['Richardson, Sarah J', 'Matthews, Christine', 'Catherwood, Mark A', 'Alexander, H Denis', 'Carey, B Sean', 'Farrugia, Joanna', 'Gardiner, Anne', 'Mould, Sarah', 'Oscier, David', 'Copplestone, J Adrian', 'Prentice, Archibald G']","['Richardson SJ', 'Matthews C', 'Catherwood MA', 'Alexander HD', 'Carey BS', 'Farrugia J', 'Gardiner A', 'Mould S', 'Oscier D', 'Copplestone JA', 'Prentice AG']","['Department of Haematology Level 7, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth PL6 8DH, United Kingdom. sarah.richardson@phnt.swest.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CCL19', 'Chemokine CCL21', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CC/pharmacology', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",,2005/12/08 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2005/12/08 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65541-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-04-1718 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3584-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1718.

Consequently, new antileukemia strategies based on Fas activation have to meet the criterion of strictly localized action at the tumor-cell surface. Recent insight into the FasL/Fas system has revealed that soluble homotrimeric FasL (sFasL) is in fact nontoxic to normal cells, but also lacks tumoricidal activity. We report on a novel fusion protein, designated scFvCD7:sFasL, that is designed to have leukemia-restricted activity. ScFvCD7:sFasL consists of sFasL genetically linked to a high-affinity single-chain fragment of variable regions (scFv) antibody fragment specific for the T-cell leukemia-associated antigen CD7. Soluble homotrimeric scFvCD7:sFasL is inactive and acquires tumoricidal activity only after specific binding to tumor cell-surface-expressed CD7. Treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines and patient-derived T-ALL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and CD7-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with homotrimeric scFvCD7:sFasL revealed potent CD7-restricted induction of apoptosis that was augmented by conventional drugs, farnesyl transferase inhibitor L-744832, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade; Millenium, Cambridge, MA). Importantly, identical treatment did not affect normal human peripheral-blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and endothelial cells, with only moderate apoptosis in interleukin-2 (IL-2)/CD3-activated T cells. CD7-restricted activation of Fas in T-cell leukemic cells by scFvCD7:sFasL revitalizes interest in the applicability of Fas signaling in leukemia therapy.","['Bremer, Edwin', 'ten Cate, Bram', 'Samplonius, Douwe F', 'de Leij, Lou F M H', 'Helfrich, Wijnand']","['Bremer E', 'ten Cate B', 'Samplonius DF', 'de Leij LF', 'Helfrich W']","['University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Medical Biology Section, Laboratory for Tumor Immunology, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD7/genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Bystander Effect', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use']",,2005/12/08 09:00,2006/05/09 09:00,['2005/12/08 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65627-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-07-2929 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Apr 1;107(7):2863-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-07-2929.

The cells were confirmed to be of the erythroid lineage based on expression of the gamma-globin message. They were induced to differentiate into benzidine-positive cells by hemin and delta-amino levulinic acid (delta-ALA). An analysis of cell membrane lipids showed that EEB cells contain a type of glycerolipid, phosphatidylglucose (PhGlc), but not unbranched type 2 chains, i antigens. GL-7 which is a recombinant Fab fragment of GL-2 and binds to PhGlc, induced production of hemoglobin F (HbF) associated with accumulation of the gamma-globin (gamma-globin) message in EEB cells.

We investigated whether residents of the area around Schiphol are at higher risk of developing cancer than the general Dutch population. METHODS: In a population-based study using the regional cancer registry, we estimated the cancer incidence during 1988-2003 in residents of the area surrounding Schiphol. We defined a study area based on aircraft noise contours and 4-digit postal code areas, since historical data on ambient air pollution were not available and recent emission data did not differ from the background urban air quality. RESULTS: In residents of the study area 13 207 cancer cases were diagnosed, which was close to the expected number, using national incidence rates as a reference (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.02). We found a statistically significantly increased incidence of hematological malignancies (SIR 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 1.19), mainly due to high rates for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.33) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (SIR 1.34, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.83). The incidence of cancer of the respiratory system was statistically significantly decreased (SIR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99), due to the low rate in males (SIR 0.89). In the core zone of the study area, cancer incidence was slightly higher than in the remaining ring zone (rate ratio of the core zone compared to the ring zone 1.05, 95% CI 1.01, 1.10). This was caused by the higher incidence of cancer of the respiratory system, prostate and the female genital organs in the core zone in comparison to the ring zone. CONCLUSION: The overall cancer incidence in the Schiphol area was similar to the national incidence. The moderately increased risk of hematological malignancies could not be explained by higher levels of ambient air pollution in the Schiphol area. This observation warrants further research, for example in a study with focus on substances in urban ambient air pollution, as similar findings were observed in Greater Amsterdam.","['Visser, Otto', 'van Wijnen, Joop H', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E']","['Visser O', 'van Wijnen JH', 'van Leeuwen FE']","['Comprehensive Cancer Centre Amsterdam, PO Box 9236, 1006 AE Amsterdam, The Netherlands. o.visser@ikca.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', '*Aviation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Vehicle Emissions/*adverse effects']",,2005/12/08 09:00,2006/01/31 09:00,['2005/12/08 09:00'],"['2005/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2458-5-127 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-5-127 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2005 Dec 6;5:127. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-5-127.,,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)']",,,PMC1325225,,,20051206,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, expression data for these antigens, as determined in 137 B-CLL cases, all with survivals, were utilized to devise a comprehensive immunophenotypic scoring system of prognostic relevance for B-CLL patients. In particular, univariate z score was employed to identify the markers with greater prognostic impact, while maximally selected log-rank statistics were chosen to define the optimal cut-off points capable to split patients into two groups with different survivals. A weighted immunophenotypic scoring system was developed by integrating results from these analyses. Six antigens were selected: three positive prognosticators (CD62L, CD54, CD49c) and three negative prognosticators (CD49d, CD38, CD79b), with cut-off values ranging from 30% to 50% of positive cells. By weighing the expression of each marker according to its statistical power, a complete scoring system, with point values comprised between 0 (complete absence of phenotypic conditions associated with good prognosis) and 9 (all the phenotypic conditions associated with good prognosis fulfilled), allowed to split the whole set of B-CLL patients, into three distinctive prognostic groups (P = 4.78 x 10(-11)) with high- (score 0-3), intermediate- (score 4-6), and low- (score 7-9) risk of death. The three risk groups showed different distribution of cases as for Rai's stages, IgVH mutations, and ZAP-70 expression.

New agents are needed to reduce the recurrence rate after frontline chemotherapy. Vincristine is an important component of ALL therapy. In animal models, the encapsulation of vincristine into sphingomyelin liposomes or ""sphingosomes"" for injection (SV) has improved efficacy compared with conventional vincristine. METHODS: A Phase II clinical trial of single-agent SV given at a dose of 2.0 mg/m2 every 2 weeks was conducted in patients with recurrent or refractory ALL. Approximately half of the 16 patients who received SV had a first CR duration of less than 1 year, 19% had failed standard induction chemotherapy, and 50% had Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease. SV was the first salvage attempt in 69% of the patients. RESULTS: The overall response rate in the 14 evaluable patients was 14% (1 CR and 1 partial response). Five patients (36%) had transient reductions in bone marrow leukemia infiltrate with subsequent regrowth of the leukemia between SV infusions. Toxicity with limited treatment (median number of doses was two; range, one to five doses) was minimal with expected peripheral neuropathy.

Samples from 138 patients with B-CLL were investigated for APAF-1 expression and p53 mutations. The results were related to survival data, in vitro cytotoxicity of various cytotoxic drugs and IR and clinico-pathological data. Variable APAF-1 expression was observed in all investigated B-CLL samples. Reduction in APAF-1 expression was observed at both mRNA and protein level indicating transcriptional silencing whereas mutation of p53 or the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (IgH(V)) had no impact on APAF-1 expression. Surprisingly, APAF-1 loss did not result in resistance to cytotoxic therapies. Likewise, APAF-1 downregulation on its own showed no impact on disease prognosis.

In this report, we investigate the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of GVT against solid tumors, using a modification of the mouse parent-to-F1 BMT model. Mouse Colon26 cells in which tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor expression was stably knocked down were transplanted to investigate the role of the TRAIL-TRAIL receptor system in the GVT effect. In addition, Fas ligand-(FasL) deficient mice on a C57BL6 (B6) background were used as donors, to determine the significance of the Fas-FasL system for the antitumor effect. The group that received B6 DLI followed by preconditioning with 950 rad irradiation underwent tumor reduction associated with the induction of IFN-gamma, TRAIL and tumor-cell apoptosis. In vitro cultured Colon26 cells were resistant to TRAIL but susceptible to the combination of IFN-gamma and TRAIL in a TRAIL-dose-dependent manner. The infusion of lymphocytes from FasL-defective donors reduced the tumor progression, although efficacy was decreased in the TRAIL receptor knockdown tumors but not in wild-type ones, compared with infusion of B6-derived lymphocytes. The findings indicate that GVT activity against subcutaneous colon tumors is efficiently induced by preconditioning with irradiation and allogeneic DLI, and that TRAIL and IFN-gamma act cooperatively in the antitumor effect.","['Tateishi, Keisuke', 'Ohta, Miki', 'Guleng, Bayasi', 'Kanai, Fumihiko', 'Tanaka, Yasuo', 'Asaoka, Yoshinari', 'Jazag, Amarsanaa', 'Imamura, Jun', 'Imamura, Takaaki', 'Ijichi, Hideaki', 'Ikenoue, Tsuneo', 'Kawakami, Takayuki', 'Fukushima, Yasushi', 'Washida, Miwa', 'Sata, Masataka', 'Miyagishi, Makoto', 'Taira, Kazunari', 'Yoshida, Haruhiko', 'Kawabe, Takao', 'Omata, Masao']","['Tateishi K', 'Ohta M', 'Guleng B', 'Kanai F', 'Tanaka Y', 'Asaoka Y', 'Jazag A', 'Imamura J', 'Imamura T', 'Ijichi H', 'Ikenoue T', 'Kawakami T', 'Fukushima Y', 'Washida M', 'Sata M', 'Miyagishi M', 'Taira K', 'Yoshida H', 'Kawabe T', 'Omata M']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. ktate-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21658 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 May 1;118(9):2237-46. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21658.,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tnfrsf10b protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,"['2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Information on smoking, snuff dipping, height and weight was gathered by self administered questionnaires together with personal interviews. Cancer incidence was ascertained through the year 2000 by record linkage to the nationwide Swedish Cancer Registry, Migration Registry and Cause of Death Registry. At the end of follow up, 1,309 subjects had been diagnosed with NHL (including chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and 205 with HD respectively. Age adjusted incidence rate ratios were computed using Cox proportional Hazard regression modeling. Smoking cigarette, pipe or cigar was not associated with NHL or HD. There was no evidence indicating a relation between quantity and duration of smoking and NHL or HD risk. No link was found between NHL and usage of smokeless tobacco. Having a BMI of 30 or higher did not convey excess risk of developing NHL or HD compared to normal weight (BMI 18.6-24.9). We conclude that tobacco smoking and high BMI do not entail an increased risk of NHL and HD.

To assess simultaneously the predictive value of each parameter on the risk of disease progression and on the risk of death, we completed this analysis by applying a three-states homogeneous Markov model to the whole study population. Analysis of the entire population showed that age (p < 0.001), Binet stage (p = 0.008) and CD19 positive lymphocyte count (p = 0.038) were three independent prognostic factors. However, in stage A patients, only progression into a more advanced stage, analysed as a time-dependent variable, and age had a clear impact on survival (p < 0.001 for both). Markov model revealed that an increased CD19 positive lymphocyte count increased the risk of disease progression in stage A patients (p = 0.002) but did not have direct impact on survival of either stage A patients with stable disease or stage B or C patients. An increased CD19 positive lymphocyte count at diagnosis is a marker of an increased risk of disease progression in stage A patients.

A tetracycline responsive element (TRE) was integrated into the RNA polymerase III promoter region of pBS/U6 that was used to drive specific siRNA to target the novel cytokine receptor-like factor 3 (CRLF3) gene. The results show that rtTA was able to recognize the TRE to prevent siRNA-mediated exogenous and endogenous CRLF3 gene repressions.

The RAR alpha gene fuses to variable partners (PML, PLZF, NPM, NuMA and STAT5B: X genes) leading to the expression of APL-specific fusion proteins with identical RAR alpha moieties. To analyse whether the variable X moiety could affect the activity of the fusion protein in vivo, we generated and characterized, on a comparative basis, NPM/RAR alpha transgenic mice (TM) in which the fusion gene is expressed under the control of a human Cathepsin G (hCG) minigene. We compared the features of the leukemia observed in these TM with those in hCG-PML/RAR alpha and hCG-PLZF/RAR alpha TM. In all three transgenic models, leukemia developed after a variably long latency, with variable penetrance. However, the three leukemias displayed distinct cytomorphological features. hCG-NPM/RAR alpha leukemic cells resembled monoblasts. This phenotype contrasts with what was observed in the hCG-PML/RAR alpha TM model in which the leukemic phase was characterized by the proliferation of promyelocytic blasts. Similarly, hCG-PLZF/RAR alpha TM displayed a different phenotype where terminally differentiated myeloid cells predominated. Importantly, the NPM/RAR alpha oncoprotein was found to localize in the nucleolus, unlike PML/RAR alpha and PLZF/RAR alpha, thus possibly interfering with the normal function of NPM. Similarly to what was observed in human APL patients, we found that NPM/RAR alpha and PML/RAR alpha, but not PLZF/RAR alpha leukemia, was responsive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or As2O3 treatments. Taken together, our results underscore the critical relevance of the X moiety in dictating the biology of the disease and the activity of the APL fusion oncoprotein.","['Rego, E M', 'Ruggero, D', 'Tribioli, C', 'Cattoretti, G', 'Kogan, S', 'Redner, R L', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Rego EM', 'Ruggero D', 'Tribioli C', 'Cattoretti G', 'Kogan S', 'Redner RL', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209216 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209216 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Mar 23;25(13):1974-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209216.,['CA-74031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulated IL-6/STAT3 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, for example autoimmune diseases and tumors. Type I interferon (IFN) induces the expression of proapoptotic genes and has been used in the clinical treatment of several tumors. In the present study, we found that type I IFN suppressed IL-6/STAT3-mediated transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, a type I IFN-induced protein, Daxx, also suppressed STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation, while overexpression of Daxx inhibited IL-6/STAT3-mediated gene expression. Importantly, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of Daxx expression enhanced IL-6/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a physical interaction between Daxx and STAT3 in transiently transfected 293T cells. We further found that Daxx and STAT3 were co-localized in the nucleus.

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this protein. We have previously shown that both basal and cAMP-induced degradation of cyclin D3 in Reh cells is dependent on Thr-283 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). We now provide evidence of an alternative mechanism being involved in the regulation of cyclin D3 degradation. Treatment of lymphoid cells with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), induces rapid phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D3. This degradation is not inhibited by the GSK-3beta inhibitors lithium or Kenpaullone, or by substitution of Thr-283 with Ala on cyclin D3, indicating that cyclin D3 can be degraded independently of Thr-283 phosphorylation and GSK-3beta activity. Interestingly, in vitro experiments revealed that PP1, but not PP2A, was able to dephosphorylate cyclin D3 efficiently, and PP1 was found to associate with His-tagged cyclin D3. These results support the hypothesis that PP1 constitutively keeps cyclin D3 in a stable, dephosphorylated state, and that treatment of cells with OA leads to phosphorylation and degradation of cyclin D3 through inhibition of PP1.","['Lahne, H U', 'Kloster, M M', 'Lefdal, S', 'Blomhoff, H K', 'Naderi, S']","['Lahne HU', 'Kloster MM', 'Lefdal S', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Naderi S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, P.O.

The basis for the poor response of this cancer to chemotherapy is not well understood. The atypical protein kinases C (PKCiota and PKCzeta) have previously been implicated in leukaemia cell chemoresistance. To assess the role of atypical PKC in glioblastoma cell chemoresistance, RNA interference was used to deplete human glioblastoma cells of PKCiota. Transfection of cells with either of two different RNA duplexes specific for PKCiota caused a partial sensitisation to cell death induced by the chemotherapy agent cisplatin. To screen for possible mechanisms for PKCiota-mediated chemoresistance, microarray analysis of gene expression was performed on RNA from glioblastoma cells that were either untreated or depleted of PKCiota. This identified sets of genes that were regulated either positively or negatively by PKCiota. Within the set of genes that were negatively regulated by PKCiota, the function of the gene coding for GMFbeta, an enhancer of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling, was investigated further, as the p38 MAP kinase pathway has been previously identified as a key mediator of cisplatin cytotoxicity. The expression of both GMFbeta mRNA and protein increased upon PKCiota depletion, and this was accompanied by an increase in cisplatin-activated p38 MAP kinase signaling. Transient overexpression of GMFbeta increased cisplatin-activated p38 MAP kinase signaling and also sensitised cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity. The increase in cisplatin cytotoxicity seen with PKCiota depletion was blocked by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SKF86002. These data show that PKCiota can confer partial resistance to cisplatin in glioblastoma cells by suppressing GMFbeta-mediated enhancement of p38 MAP kinase signaling.","['Baldwin, R M', 'Garratt-Lalonde, M', 'Parolin, D A E', 'Krzyzanowski, P M', 'Andrade, M A', 'Lorimer, I A J']","['Baldwin RM', 'Garratt-Lalonde M', 'Parolin DA', 'Krzyzanowski PM', 'Andrade MA', 'Lorimer IA']","['Ottawa Health Research Institute, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Cytoprotection', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glia Maturation Factor/metabolism', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2006/06/21 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209312 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209312 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 11;25(20):2909-19. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209312.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glia Maturation Factor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C lambda)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two formulations of SAHA (intravenous [IV] and oral) have been assessed in two consecutive phase I trials. In both trials, dose escalation was performed in parallel and independently in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Eligible patients were required to have adequate hepatic and renal function, an absolute neutrophil count > or = 500/microL and a platelet count more than 25,000/mL. All patients provided informed consent for study inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with hematologic malignancy were enrolled (14 on IV SAHA and 25 on oral SAHA), of whom 35 were treated. The spectrum of diseases included patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 12), Hodgkin's disease (HD; n = 12), multiple myeloma (n = 2), T-cell lymphoma (n = 3), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 2), small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 2), and myeloid leukemia (n = 2). Major adverse events with the oral formulation included fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia, and dehydration, whereas myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia were more prominent with the IV formulation. Typically, the hematologic toxicities resolved shortly after SAHA was stopped. There was no neutropenic fever or neutropenic sepsis. Reduction in measurable tumor was observed in five patients. One patient with transformed small lymphocytic lymphoma met criteria for complete response, whereas another met the criteria for partial response (PR). One patient with refractory HD had a PR, whereas three patients had stable disease for up to 9 months. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SAHA has activity in hematologic malignancies including HD and select subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","[""O'Connor, Owen A"", 'Heaney, Mark L', 'Schwartz, Lawrence', 'Richardson, Stacie', 'Willim, Robert', 'MacGregor-Cortelli, Barbara', 'Curly, Tracey', 'Moskowitz, Craig', 'Portlock, Carol', 'Horwitz, Steven', 'Zelenetz, Andrew D', 'Frankel, Stanley', 'Richon, Victoria', 'Marks, Paul', 'Kelly, William K']","[""O'Connor OA"", 'Heaney ML', 'Schwartz L', 'Richardson S', 'Willim R', 'MacGregor-Cortelli B', 'Curly T', 'Moskowitz C', 'Portlock C', 'Horwitz S', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Frankel S', 'Richon V', 'Marks P', 'Kelly WK']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY 10021, USA. oconnoro@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vorinostat']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.01.9679 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.01.9679 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 1;24(1):166-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.9679.

A considerable number of patients with this cytogenetic abnormality relapse and die of their disease. We evaluated the clinical significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in t(9;11)(p22;q23)-positive AML patients using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis. DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 34 newly diagnosed patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23)-positive AML treated within three multicenter trials of the AML Study Group. MRD could be investigated by RQ-PCR in 19 patients during and after therapy. Because of the relatively low sensitivity of the RQ-PCR (10(-3) to 10(-4) at the cellular level), samples from RQ-PCR-negative patients were also analyzed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR; sensitivity 10-4 to 10-5 at the cellular level). RESULTS: RQ-PCR monitoring revealed two groups of patients: group 1 (n=11) had negative RQ-PCR in all samples collected in hematologic complete remission whereas group 2 (n=8) had at least one positive RQ-PCR in samples collected in complete remission during therapy. Group 1 had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of relapse (p=0.004) and better overall survival (p=0.003) compared to group 2. nPCR did not add information to that gained from RQ-PCR. Molecular relapse was detected in two patients by RQ-PCR four and six weeks, respectively before hematologic relapse occurred. Quantitative MLL-AF9 levels at diagnosis or during and after therapy had no prognostic impact. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Early achievement of sustained RQ-PCR negativity appears to be a prerequisite for long-term hematologic complete remission in t(9;11)-positive AML. Furthermore, RQ-PCR might be useful for early detection of relapse. Additional patients need to be studied to corroborate these findings.","['Scholl, Claudia', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Eiwen, Karina', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Scholl C', 'Schlenk RF', 'Eiwen K', 'Dohner H', 'Frohling S', 'Dohner K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Robert-Koch-Str. 8, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*blood', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*blood', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Dec;90(12):1626-34.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4', 'MAC chemotherapy protocol']",['Haematologica. 2005 Dec;90(12):1586A.

Although new FLT3 mutations are being increasing by investigated, the role of FLT3 expression levels in wild type as well as in mutated FLT3 has only been infrequently addressed. DESIGN AND METHODS: To further evaluate the role of FLT3 in AML we investigated FLT3 expression levels in 207 adult AML patients and 8 healthy donors by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The expression levels were correlated with clinical parameters, FAB types, cytogenetics, flow cytometry, microarray analysis, FLT3 mutations, further molecular aberrations and prognosis. RESULTS: FLT3 expression levels were different in certain FAB types with increasing levels in the following order: M3<M3v<M6<M2<M4eo<M4<M0<M1<M5a<M5b. These results correlate with the FLT3 receptor surface expression (CD135) detected by flow cytometry (p<0.001), showing the highest CD135 expression in FAB M5. Independent analysis of FLT3 expression in cytogenetic AML subgroups showed the lowest levels in t(15;17) and the highest in the t(11q23) positive AML. In addition, FLT3 expression levels correlated with high percentages of bone marrow blasts (p<0.001) and high leukocyte counts (p<0.001). On the molecular level, no differences in FLT3 expression levels were detected between AML with and without any FLT3 mutation as well as for FAB M5 with or without MLL abnormalities (p=0.495). Furthermore, no significant difference could be found between the group of t(11q23) and MLL-PTD (p=0.180) or between MLL-PTD positive and MLL negative normal karyotypes (p=0.859). In patients with normal cytogenetics no impact or overall survival or event-free survival could be detected (p=0.128 and p=0.305, respectively) regardless of FLT3 muatation status, whereas investigating the group of patients with normal cytogenetics and wild-type FLT3, a clear tendency for a worse overall (p=0.059) and event free (p=0.087) survival was found.

Here, we investigate whether these two agents influence the in vitro differentiation-inducing effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on AML cells, an effective drug for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that is a unique subtype of AML with a specific fusion protein, PML-RARalpha. DESIGN AND METHODS: The APL cell line NB4 and non-APL promonocytic leukemic cell line U937 were treated with As2O3 (0.5 microM) combined with CoCl2 (50 microM) or DFO (10 microM). The U937/PR9 subclone, whose expression of PML-RARalpha protein can be induced by Zn2+, was also investigated. Cellular differentiation was evaluated by morphological criteria and myeloid differentiation-related antigens and marker gene expression. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) mRNA and protein were detected, respectively, by semi-quantitative/real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblots. PML-RARalpha protein was also analyzed. RESULTS: CoCl2 and DFO potentiated the growth-inhibiting and differentiation-inducing effects of low-dose As2O3, the latter enhancing CoCl2 and DFO-induced accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein in NB4 cells but not in U937 cells. These two hypoxia-mimetic agents also accelerated As2O3-induced modulation and degradation of PML-RARalpha protein in NB4 cells. Furthermore, inducible expression of the fusion gene restored the co-operative effects of As2O3 and CoCl2/DFO on U937/PR9 cells in terms of growth arrest, differentiation induction and HIF-1alpha protein accumulation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Mimicked hypoxia enhanced As2O3-induced differentiation, in which HIF-1alpha and PML/RARalpha proteins played an important role. These data provide new insights into the understanding of the mechanisms of the action of As2O3 in the treatment of patients with APL.","['Yan, Hua', 'Peng, Zhen-Gang', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Jiang, Yi', 'Yu, Yun', 'Huang, Ying', 'Zhu, Yuan-Shan', 'Zhao, Qian', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Yan H', 'Peng ZG', 'Wu YL', 'Jiang Y', 'Yu Y', 'Huang Y', 'Zhu YS', 'Zhao Q', 'Chen GQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University (SJU-SM, formerly named Shanghai Second Medical University), Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects', 'Cobalt/*pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/cytology/drug effects']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Dec;90(12):1607-16.,"['DK061004/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'S/C2P30 CA29502-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",['Haematologica. 2005 Dec;90(12):1585A.

In order to identify such factors, we have established sub-lines of STO feeder cells which exhibit variable ability in supporting ES cell self-renewal. Functional screening identifies WNT5A and WNT6 as STO cell-produced factors that potently inhibit ES cell differentiation in a serum-dependent manner. Furthermore, direct activation of beta-catenin without disturbing the upstream components of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway fully recapitulates the effect of WNTs on ES cells. Importantly, the WNT/beta-catenin pathway up-regulates the mRNA for Stat3, a known regulator of ES cell self-renewal in the mouse.

MPO is usually detected by cytochemistry. The demonstration of peroxidase in at least 3% of bone marrow blasts defines an acute leukaemia as acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). MPO is important in distinguishing acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). It is difficult to diagnose AML with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation (AML- M0) by conventional light microscopy. However, these AML-M0 blasts can be detected by monoclonal antibodies. Anti-MPO recognizes the enzymatically inactive precursor forms of MPO. There are a few commercially available monoclonal antibodies against MPO. In this study, we evaluated two monoclonal antibodies against MPO from different commercial sources. METHODS: Anti-MPO were purchased from Dako (Denmark) and Becton Dickinson, BD (California, USA). MPO detection was done using the permeabilisation-staining technique, followed by analysis with flow cytometer (FASCalibur, California, USA). RESULTS: 63 cases of acute leukaemias (38 ALL and 25 AML) were studied. Anti-MPO by Dako showed that 12/38 (31.6%) of ALL cases were positive, but all these cases were clear-cut negative for anti-MPO from BD. 24/38 (63.2%) of these ALL cases were associated with aberrant expression of myeloid antigens. However, only 8/24 (33.3%) cases with aberrant myeloid antigen expression showed positive reaction to anti-MPO (Dako). 23/25 (92%) of AML showed concordance results for both anti-MPO by Dako and BD. CONCLUSION: Anti-MPO is a useful and reliable marker for the diagnosis of AML. However, this study had demonstrated that results vary with the monoclonal antibody used in ALL cases. Anti-MPO (Dako) had shown false positive result in 31.6% of ALL cases whereas anti-MPO (BD) had shown consistent negative result in ALL cases.","['Leong, C F', 'Kalaichelvi, A V M', 'Cheong, S K', 'Hamidah, N H', 'Rahman, J', 'Sivagengei, K']","['Leong CF', 'Kalaichelvi AV', 'Cheong SK', 'Hamidah NH', 'Rahman J', 'Sivagengei K']","['Haematology Unit, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Yaakob Latif, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/*analysis/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/enzymology']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2004 Dec;26(2):111-6.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of PCR-based techniques have been developed to overcome the disadvantages of Southern blotting, the standard technique in detecting IgH gene rearrangement. Using an established seminested PCR technique with consensus primers to the V and J regions of the IgH gene, we analysed DNA prepared from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow specimens from 30 cases of known B cell malignancies (16 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 11 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 3 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma), 3 cases of T lymphoproliferative disease and 3 cases of reactive lymphocytosis diagnosed in Hospital UKM to detect rearranged IgH gene. We found that monoclonality as represented by the presence of rearranged IgH gene were demonstrated in all the 30 cases. The PCR findings showed 100% concordance with the Southern blot analysis results which also showed rearranged IgH bands in all the 30 cases. We also found that none of the cases of T lymphoproliferative diseases and reactive lymphocytosis showed presence of rearranged IgH band, suggesting that the amplification using the IgH primers is lineage-specific. In conclusion, we find the PCR a useful method to detect IgH gene rearrangement in peripheral blood and bone marrow specimen. Since the PCR results are comparable to that of the Southern blotting in demonstrating B cell monoclonality and owing to its many advantages we feel that it can replace the Southern blot technique for the diagnosis of B cell malignancies.","['Ainoon, O', 'Hamidah, A B', 'Cheong, S K', 'Hamidah, H N']","['Ainoon O', 'Hamidah AB', 'Cheong SK', 'Hamidah HN']","['Haematology Unit, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Hospital UKM, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,2005/12/07 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2000 Jun;22(1):5-11.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in the characterization of both B-CLL and normal B cell subpopulations by phenotypic analysis, global gene expression profiling, as well as extensive IgV gene repertoire analyses have shed new light on the phenotype and the cell derivation of B-CLL and provided novel hypotheses concerning its pathogenesis. Here we summarize recent work relevant to these issues and conclude that B-CLL may be derived from a cell that can be referred to as a marginal zone B cell. Moreover, we propose that the lack of chromosomal translocations in B-CLL may be related to their derivation from marginal zone B cells, since somatic hypermutation and Ig class switch, the processes that generate chromosome translocations in most germinal center (GC)-derived malignancies, are no longer active in marginal zone B cells. Also, we discuss similarities and differences between B-CLL and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and suggest that also HCL may be derived from a post-GC memory or marginal zone B cell.","['Klein, U', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Klein U', 'Dalla-Favera R']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/metabolism']",70,2005/12/07 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/12/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/3-540-29933-5_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2005;294:31-49. doi: 10.1007/3-540-29933-5_3.,['CA-37295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, induced monocytic differentiation was also enhanced by CD38 and not enhanced by higher expression levels, but without induced loss of viability.

The first is related to the inhibition of topoisomerase II and the second presumably reflects a covalent binding of drug metabolites to DNA. It is hypothesized that the replacement of the primary amino group (-NH(2)) at the C-3' position of the daunosamine moiety by a trisubstituted amidino group (-N=CH-NRR) may be a route to the synthesis of anthracycline derivatives with enhanced ability to form covalent adducts to DNA.","['Ciesielska, E', 'Studzian, K', 'Wasowska, M', 'Oszczapowicz, I', 'Szmigiero, L']","['Ciesielska E', 'Studzian K', 'Wasowska M', 'Oszczapowicz I', 'Szmigiero L']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azepines/*chemistry', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/*chemistry']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2004/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10565-005-0142-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2005 May-Jul;21(3-4):139-47. doi: 10.1007/s10565-005-0142-1.,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Morpholines)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunocytochemical methods (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (fluorescence) were used simultaneously on nucleated cell cytospins. The ratio of IGF-IR positive cells and apoptotic cells as well as the relationship between them were then analyzed separately. A quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was administrated for six MDS cases and two normal controls to validate IGF-IR expression detected by immunochemistry. In our assay, IGF-IR appeared to have higher to lower expression rate in turn from AML (86.8+/-13.8%) to MDS (56.8+/-14.3%) and then to normal controls (40.4+/-9.6%) (P<0.01 between each group). In MDS nucleated cells, IGF-IR showed stronger expression in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)/RAEB in transformation/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia subgroup when compared to RA/RA with ringed sideroblasts cases (64.1+/-3.2 vs 53.5+/-16.2%) (P>0.05).

For both AML and MDS cases, apoptotic signals presented mainly in individual IGF-IR negative cells (9.0+/-4.8%) and less so in IGF-IR positive cells (1.4+/-2.4%) (P<0.01). When analyzed by groups, cell number with IGF-IR expression showed a negative correlation to apoptotic cells amount (r=-0.852; P<0.01) but positive correlation to their blast count (r=0.677; P<0.01).

Questions remain, however, as to whether this observation can be explained by a gammadelta T cell-based immune response against primary leukemia. METHODS: We examined gammadelta T cell receptor (TCR) phenotype, cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity following culture with irradiated primary leukemia blasts from a haploidentical first-degree relative. Subsequently, we also studied the gammadelta TCR phenotype and complimentarity determining region 3 (CDR3) cDNA sequences from 17 newly diagnosed leukemia patients. RESULTS: In 17/28 (61%) of in vitro cultures, gammadelta T cells proliferated in culture with primary blasts. Vdelta1+ T cells were proportionally increased in all cultures and were the predominant cell population in 6/17. In the 7 cultures where cytotoxicity could be assessed, 6 (86%) showed some degree of cytotoxicity to the primary leukemia. Vdelta1+ T cells were also the predominant gammadelta T cell subtype in pre-treatment leukemia patients principally due to loss of Vdelta2+ T cells rather than expansion of Vdelta1+ cells. The Vdelta1 CDR3-region cDNA sequence from these patients revealed exclusive use of the Jdelta1 constant region and sequence conservation in 4/11 patients. CONCLUSIONS: gammadelta T cells exhibit an in vitro response to primary leukemia blasts that is manifested by proliferation, an increased proportion of Vdelta1+ T cells, and cytotoxicity to the primary leukemia blasts. The Vdelta1+ T cell population is also predominant in newly diagnosed leukemia patients likely due to a loss of circulating Vdelta2+ T cells. A small proportion of newly diagnosed patients showed Vdelta1 CDR3 region similarity. These findings suggest a role for gammadelta T cells in the immune response to leukemia.","['Meeh, Paul F', 'King, Michelle', ""O'Brien, Rebecca L"", 'Muga, Stephanie', 'Buckhalts, Philip', 'Neuberg, Ronnie', 'Lamb, Lawrence S Jr']","['Meeh PF', 'King M', ""O'Brien RL"", 'Muga S', 'Buckhalts P', 'Neuberg R', 'Lamb LS Jr']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, SC, 29203, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/08/22 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-005-0094-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Sep;55(9):1072-80. doi: 10.1007/s00262-005-0094-6.

Since binding of Hox 3 factors to target DNA is enhanced by the co-factor Pbx, we investigated whether Pbx1 is also required for angiogenesis. We observed that EC predominantly express the Pbx1b isoform. Nuclear extracts from angiogenic EC express higher levels of active Pbx1 and more effectively form complexes on Pbx1/Hox consensus DNA oligonucleotides as compared to nuclear extracts from quiescent EC. Introduction of anti-sense against Pbx1 impaired the formation of Pbx1/Hox complexes on target DNA consensus in nuclear extracts from angiogenic EC. Anti-sense against Pbx1 also impaired EC migration and blocked angiogenesis induced by bFGF in vivo. Furthermore, although the levels of Hox D3 were unchanged, expression of its target gene, beta3 integrin was reduced, consistent with impaired transcriptional activation by Hox D3.

Yet, little is known about the role of Mcl-1 in HCC. In this study, we analyzed the relevance of Mcl-1 expression for the apop-tosis resistance of human HCC. Mcl-1 protein expression was considerably enhanced in human HCC tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue. In addition, Mcl-1 was prominently expressed in various HCC cell lines. Mcl-1 basal expression is dependent on a functional phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway; treatment of the cells with a specific PI3 kinase inhibitor led to both decreased Mcl-1 expression and a sensitization towards chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor induced Mcl-1 expression in an Akt- and ERK-dependent manner. Finally, specific upregulation of Mcl-1 in HCC cells inhibited chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that Mcl-1 is an important factor for the apoptosis resistance of human HCC, and constitutes an interesting target for HCC therapy.","['Fleischer, Binje', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Schuchmann, Marcus', 'Weber, Achim', 'Biesterfeld, Stefan', 'Muller, Martina', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Galle, Peter R']","['Fleischer B', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Schuchmann M', 'Weber A', 'Biesterfeld S', 'Muller M', 'Krammer PH', 'Galle PR']","['I.

The remission intention (RI) rate for elderly patients, as reported to the Swedish Leukemia Registry, was known to be different when comparing the six health care regions, but the consequences of different management are unknown. The Leukemia Registry, containing 1672 AML patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2001, with 98% coverage and a median follow-up of 4 years, was completed with data from the compulsory cancer and population registries. Among 506 treated and untreated patients aged 70-79 years with AML (non-APL), there was a direct correlation between the RI rate in each health region (range 36-76%) and the two-year overall survival, with no censored observations (6-21%) (chi-squared for trend=11.3, P<0.001; r2=0.86, P<0.02, nonparametric). A 1-month landmark analysis showed significantly better survival in regions with higher RI rates (P=0.003). Differences could not be explained by demographics, and was found in both de novo and secondary leukemias. The 5-year survival of the overall population aged 70-79 years was similar between the regions. Survival of 70-79-year-old AML patients is better in regions where more elderly patients are judged eligible for remission induction.","['Juliusson, G', 'Billstrom, R', 'Gruber, A', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E', 'Hoglunds, M', 'Karlsson, K', 'Stockelberg, D', 'Wahlin, A', 'Astrom, M', 'Arnesson, C', 'Brunell-Abrahamsson, U', 'Carstensen, J', 'Fredriksson, E', 'Holmberg, E', 'Nordenskjold, K', 'Wiklund, F']","['Juliusson G', 'Billstrom R', 'Gruber A', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Hoglunds M', 'Karlsson K', 'Stockelberg D', 'Wahlin A', 'Astrom M', 'Arnesson C', 'Brunell-Abrahamsson U', 'Carstensen J', 'Fredriksson E', 'Holmberg E', 'Nordenskjold K', 'Wiklund F']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital and Regional Oncology Centre, Linkoping, Sweden.

We therefore explored a refined immunomagnetic separation strategy to effectively deplete alloreactive donor lymphocytes expressing the activation antigen CD69 upon stimulation, and examined the retainment of antiviral, antileukemic, and immunoregulatory T cells. In addition to the CD69high T cell fraction, our studies retrieved two T cell subsets based on residual CD69 expression. Whereas, truly CD69(neg) cells were devoid of detectable alloresponses to original stimulators, CD69-low (CD69low)-expressing T cells elicited significant residual alloreactivity upon restimulation. In interferon-gamma enzyme linked immunospot assays, anti-cytomegalovirus and anti-Epstein-Barr virus responses were preserved at significant numbers among CD69neg T lymphocytes. Accordingly, T cells recognizing the leukemia-associated Wilm's tumor-1 antigen were still detectable in the CD69neg subset. However, antiviral and antileukemic specificities were also consistently found within CD69low T cells, suggesting that memory-type donor T cells were partially captured due to residual CD69 expression. Finally, CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ immunoregulatory T cells did not upregulate CD69 upon allogeneic stimulation. Our data suggest that CD69-mediated removal of alloreactivity can result in efficient allodepletion, but may partially affect the persistence of antiviral and antileukemic donor memory specificities captured among CD69low-expressing lymphocytes.","['Hartwig, U F', 'Nonn, M', 'Khan, S', 'Meyer, R G', 'Huber, C', 'Herr, W']","['Hartwig UF', 'Nonn M', 'Khan S', 'Meyer RG', 'Huber C', 'Herr W']","['Department of Medicine III--Hematology and Oncology, Johannes Gutenberg-University School of Medicine, Mainz, Germany. uhartwig@mail.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/etiology/immunology', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/05/09 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705238 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705238 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Feb;37(3):297-305. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705238.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (WTAP protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether primary HIV-1 infected subjects with sustained virological control (< 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml plasma) post-cessation antiretroviral therapy (ART) had a higher initial LIF response during primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) as compared with those individuals who did not achieve a similar control (> 9000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml plasma) of HIV-1 replication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutively obtained HIV plasma samples were collected from primary HIV-1 infected subjects. A group of acutely Epstein-Barr virus-infected subjects and a group of HIV-1-seronegative healthy individuals served as controls. All samples were tested by ELISA for LIF and sgp130, the soluble form of LIF's signalling receptor. RESULTS: LIF and sgp130 plasma levels were significantly increased in primary HIV-1-infected subjects as compared with HIV-1-seronegative controls. Peak plasma levels of LIF occurred during the first week of PHI whereas sgp130 peaked between 2 and 4 weeks after the onset of PHI. Furthermore a positive correlation was found between viral load and plasma levels of LIF during PHI. Both LIF and sgp130 plasma concentrations were significantly lower during the viral rebound phase after treatment interruption as compared with the PHI phase. CONCLUSIONS: LIF induction occurred in the initial stages of viral dissemination during PHI. It may be a part of the virally induced generalized pro-inflammatory response. LIF levels at PHI did not predict low levels of HIV viraemia after discontinuation of ART. LIF was not increased following ART interruption in this early treated population.","['Tjernlund, Annelie', 'Barqasho, Babilonia', 'Nowak, Piotr', 'Kinloch, Sabine', 'Thorborn, Daren', 'Perrin, Luc', 'Sonnerborg, Anders', 'Walther-Jallow, Lilian', 'Andersson, Jan']","['Tjernlund A', 'Barqasho B', 'Nowak P', 'Kinloch S', 'Thorborn D', 'Perrin L', 'Sonnerborg A', 'Walther-Jallow L', 'Andersson J']","['Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

A total of 51 patients with hematologic disorders were treated with myeloablation and transplantation with either unrelated human leucocyte antigen (HLA) partially matched umbilical cord blood or HLA-matched unrelated donor grafts during 1997-2003. In evaluation of survival of these patients, the log rank and Wilcoxon tests lead to ambiguous results, which also happen in other applications. While the asymptotic properties of these tests are well understood, it is not clear how they behave in a small and specific sample. To resolve the ambiguity and to better understand our patient sample, we compare the power of the two tests by simulation in small samples with piecewise log-logistic and Weibull distributions and with different censoring distributions. Our simulation study confirms the well known fact that when the hazards of underlying survival distributions are non-proportional early on, say t < t(0), but proportional when t> or = t(0), the Wilcoxon test has more power than log rank test. But the importance of our simulation is to gain insight into the time point and impact of t(0) with respect to our transplantation study of leukemia cancer patients. We now conclude that overall survivals of patients with two graft sources are statistically significantly different, in part due to the delay of neutrophil recovery of one patient population immediately after transplantation. Thus, we recommend that Wilcoxon test should be used in future studies of similarly designed clinical trials.","['Fu, Pingfu', 'Laughlin, Mary J', 'Zhang, Heping']","['Fu P', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA. pxf16@case.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Contemp Clin Trials,Contemporary clinical trials,101242342,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', 'Hematologic Diseases/*mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', '*Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2004/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1551-7144(05)00146-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cct.2005.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Contemp Clin Trials. 2006 Apr;27(2):174-82. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2005.10.003.

Typically, CLL follows an indolent course, with most patients surviving for many years. However, 10-20% of CLL patients carry 11q23 chromosomal deletions and often exhibit a more severe disease course, with earlier onset of symptoms, shortened lymphocyte doubling time, poor response to therapy, and shortened survival. The molecular basis for 11q23 deletions resulting in a poor prognosis is currently poorly understood. The tumor suppressor gene, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM, 11q22.3-23.1), is considered a likely candidate gene whose loss could result in the poor prognosis associated with 11q23 deletion and is mutated in a significant percentage of CLL cases. Recently, recombinant ATM expression in ATM-deficient cells was found to decrease transferrin receptor (TfR) expression, suggesting that deletion of the chromosomal region carrying ATM results in increased TfR expression. TfR imports iron into cells, an event necessary for DNA synthesis and cell growth. Additionally, rapidly growing malignant cells, including lymphomas and CLL, often express high TfR levels. Based on this, we propose that one molecular mechanism by which 11q23 deletions confer a poor prognosis in CLL is via increased TfR expression secondary to ATM loss, resulting in the increased cellular iron import, and hence increased capacity for malignant growth. Our hypothesis may also partially explain why gallium, an atomically iron-like toxic metal that binds to transferrin and the TfR is incorporated into cells and was previously demonstrated to have anti-tumor activity in patients with lymphomas refractory to other chemotherapeutic treatments.","['Shackelford, Rodney E', 'Bhalodia, Ami R', 'Cotelingam, James D', 'Veillon, Diana M', 'Lowery-Nordberg, Mary']","['Shackelford RE', 'Bhalodia AR', 'Cotelingam JD', 'Veillon DM', 'Lowery-Nordberg M']","['Louisiana State University at Shreveport, Department of Pathology, 1501 Kings Hwy, P.O.

However, purified virus preparations obtained by this routine method usually contain considerable amounts of contaminating cell membrane vesicles. In addition, sucrose solutions are highly viscous and hyperosmotic which jeopardizes the integrity and functionality of the retrovirus particle. In order to overcome these limitations, an alternative purification technique using rate zonal ultracentrifugation and iodixanol as gradient medium was developed. Recombinant retrovirus particles were produced by 293-GPG packaging cells grown in suspension in the presence of 10% FBS. Concentrated supernatants were purified by rate zonal sedimentation on a 10-30% continuous iodixanol gradient. Virus particles were recovered intact and active from the central fractions of the gradient. By using this strategy, high levels of purification were achieved, with no evident contamination with cell membrane vesicles as indicated by subtilisin treatment studies.

We aimed to assess whether patients with the mutation are biologically distinct from those without, and why the same mutation is associated with different disease phenotypes. METHODS: Two sensitive PCR-based methods were used to assess the JAK2 mutation status of 806 patients with essential thrombocythaemia, including 776 from the Medical Research Council's Primary Thrombocythaemia trial (MRC PT-1) and two other prospective studies. Laboratory and clinical features, response to treatment, and clinical events were compared for V617F-positive and V617F-negative patients with essential thrombocythaemia. FINDINGS: Mutation-positive patients had multiple features resembling polycythaemia vera, with significantly increased haemoglobin (mean increase 9.6 g/L, 95% CI 7.6-11.6 g/L; p<0.0001), neutrophil counts (1.1x10(9)/L, 0.7-1.5x10(9)/L; p<0.0001), bone marrow erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis, more venous thromboses, and a higher rate of polycythaemic transformation than those without the mutation. Mutation-positive patients had lower serum erythropoietin (mean decrease 13.8 U/L; 95% CI, 10.8-16.9 U/L; p<0.0001) and ferritin (n=182; median 58 vs 91 mug/L; p=0.01) concentrations than did mutation-negative patients. Mutation-negative patients did, nonetheless, show many clinical and laboratory features that were characteristic of a myeloproliferative disorder. V617F-positive individuals were more sensitive to therapy with hydroxyurea, but not anagrelide, than those without the JAK2 mutation. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that JAK2 V617F-positive essential thrombocythaemia and polycythaemia vera form a biological continuum, with the degree of erythrocytosis determined by physiological or genetic modifiers.","['Campbell, Peter J', 'Scott, Linda M', 'Buck, Georgina', 'Wheatley, Keith', 'East, Clare L', 'Marsden, Joanne T', 'Duffy, Audrey', 'Boyd, Elaine M', 'Bench, Anthony J', 'Scott, Mike A', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Milligan, Donald W', 'Smith, Steve R', 'Erber, Wendy N', 'Bareford, David', 'Wilkins, Bridget S', 'Reilly, John T', 'Harrison, Claire N', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Campbell PJ', 'Scott LM', 'Buck G', 'Wheatley K', 'East CL', 'Marsden JT', 'Duffy A', 'Boyd EM', 'Bench AJ', 'Scott MA', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Milligan DW', 'Smith SR', 'Erber WN', 'Bareford D', 'Wilkins BS', 'Reilly JT', 'Harrison CN', 'Green AR']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Thrombocytopenia/classification/*genetics']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(05)67785-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67785-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2005 Dec 3;366(9501):1945-53. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67785-9.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,"['United Kingdom Myeloproliferative Disorders Study Group', 'Medical Research Council Adult Leukaemia Working Party', 'Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group']",,,,

Here we show that human granulocytic differentiation is controlled by a regulatory circuitry involving miR-223 and two transcriptional factors, NFI-A and C/EBPalpha. The two factors compete for binding to the miR-223 promoter: NFI-A maintains miR-223 at low levels, whereas its replacement by C/EBPalpha, following retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation, upregulates miR-223 expression. The competition by C/EBPalpha and the granulocytic differentiation are favored by a negative-feedback loop in which miR-223 represses NFI-A translation. In line with this, both RNAi against NFI-A and ectopic expression of miR-223 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells enhance differentiation, whereas miR-223 knockdown inhibits the differentiation response to RA. Altogether, our data indicate that miR-223 plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis and point to the NFI-A repression as an important molecular pathway mediating gene reprogramming in this cell lineage.","['Fazi, Francesco', 'Rosa, Alessandro', 'Fatica, Alessandro', 'Gelmetti, Vania', 'De Marchis, Maria Laura', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Bozzoni, Irene']","['Fazi F', 'Rosa A', 'Fatica A', 'Gelmetti V', 'De Marchis ML', 'Nervi C', 'Bozzoni I']","['Department of Histology and Medical Embryology, University of Rome La Sapienza and San Raffaele Biomedical Science Park of Rome, Via di Castel Romano 100, 00128, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelopoiesis/*physiology', 'NFI Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0092-8674(05)00977-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2005.09.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2005 Dec 2;123(5):819-31. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2005.09.023.,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, RUNX activity must be tightly regulated to prevent tumorigenesis and maintain normal cell differentiation. Recent work indicates that RUNX activity is controlled by various extracellular signaling pathways, and that phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination are important post-translational modifications of RUNX that affect its stability and activity.

We have become aware of four patients with low grade B-cell malignancies seen in our clinical practice at Mayo Clinic who began, on their own initiative, oral ingestion of EGCG containing products and subsequently appeared to have an objective clinical response. Three of these four patients met criteria for partial response (PR) by standard response criteria. Although spontaneous remission/regression is occasionally observed in individuals with low grade B-cell malignancies, such events are rare. Several patients presented here had documented steady clinical, laboratory, and/or radiographic evidence of progression immediately prior to initiation of over-the-counter green tea products and then developed objective responses shortly after self-initiating this therapy. Such anecdotes highlight the need for clinical trials of tea polyphenols to define the optimal dosing, schedule, toxicities, and clinical efficacy before widespread use can be recommended.

Many malignant disorders are associated with fever, which may either be of the hectic-septic variety resembling an infectious disease or prolonged and low-grade. Neoplasms with either kind of fever may present as an FUO. The malignancies usually associated with fever are lymphoreticular malignancies involving the blood, liver, spleen, or bone marrow. Most malignancies do not have fever, e.g., chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), as part of their clinical presentation. We present a case of long-standing CLL in an elderly woman who presented with an FUO. Initially, it was thought that her FUO was caused by CLL or a CLL-related opportunistic infection. The naprosyn test was used in this patient with CLL and FUO to differentiate a malignant from an infectious etiology. Her response to naprosyn indicated that the etiology of her FUO was neoplastic rather than infectious. The absence of tonsillar enlargement and peripheral adenopathy, as well as the presence of fever, argued against CLL as the cause of her fever. Computed axial tomography scans showed central adenopathy in addition to splenomegaly.

P-gp expression and/or activity has been associated with unfavourable outcome in paediatric ALL patients, whereas MRP1 and BCRP do not seem to play a major role. LRP might contribute to drug resistance in B-lineage ALL, but larger studies are needed to confirm these results. The present review summarises the current knowledge concerning multidrug resistance-related proteins and focuses on the clinical relevance and prognostic value of these efflux pumps in childhood ALL.","['Swerts, Katrien', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Dhooge, Catharina', 'Laureys, Genevieve', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Philippe, Jan']","['Swerts K', 'De Moerloose B', 'Dhooge C', 'Laureys G', 'Benoit Y', 'Philippe J']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. katrien.swerts@ugent.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/metabolism']",144,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(05)00894-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2005.09.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2006 Feb;42(3):295-309. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2005.09.017.

Data on time trends in childhood cancer incidence from the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Italy were analysed using two different approaches: standard Poisson regression and a Bayesian regression approach including an autoregressive component. Our focus was on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), since this is hypothesised to have an infectious aetiology, but for purposes of comparison we also conducted similar analyses for selected other childhood cancer sites (acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (AnLL), central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neuroblastoma (NB)). The two models fitted the data equally well, but led to different interpretations of the time trends. The first produced ever-increasing rates, while the latter produced non-monotonic patterns, particularly for ALL, which showed evidence of a cyclical pattern. The Bayesian analysis produced findings that are consistent with the hypothesis of an infectious aetiology for ALL, but not for AnLL or for solid tumours (CNS and NB). Although sudden changes in time trends should be interpreted with caution, the results of the Bayesian approach are consistent with current knowledge of the natural history of childhood ALL, including a short latency time and the postulated infectious aetiology of the disease.","['Maule, Milena Maria', 'Zuccolo, Luisa', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Pastore, Guido', 'Dalmasso, Paola', 'Pearce, Neil', 'Merletti, Franco', 'Gregori, Dario']","['Maule MM', 'Zuccolo L', 'Magnani C', 'Pastore G', 'Dalmasso P', 'Pearce N', 'Merletti F', 'Gregori D']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, CPO Piemonte, CeRMS, S.

Furthermore, flow cytometric analyses showed that HL-60 cells, human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, wherein TRAP220 was down-regulated, did not differentiate efficiently into monocytes and granulocytes by stimulation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and all-trans retinoic acid, correspondingly. The expression of direct target genes of VDR or RAR, as well as the differentiation marker genes, was low in the knockdown cells.

However, data on longitudinal treatment patterns and outcomes associated with AML and its relapse are sparse, particularly among the elderly. This study documents changes in treatment patterns and outcomes among elderly AML patients over the past decade. METHODS: Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, we retrospectively evaluated trends in mortality, treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilisation and Medicare payments associated with AML and its relapse among Medicare beneficiaries > or =65 years of age who were initially diagnosed with AML in a SEER registry between 1991 and 1999. Chemotherapy was ascertained from examination of inpatient and outpatient bills. AML relapse and retreatment were identified using a validated algorithm. Costs of care were based on total Medicare payments. RESULTS: A total of 3439 elderly patients with AML were identified. Median survival across all study patients was 2.4 months (mean +/- SD 5.6 +/- 6.8 months), with medians of 3.9, 2.2 and 1.4 months for patients 65-74 years of age, 75-84 years of age and > or =85 years of age, respectively. Fewer than 7% of patients were alive at 2 years, and there was very little variation during the decade of our analysis. Costs and overall healthcare utilisation patterns also changed very little, with the exception of those relating to hospice use and chemotherapy. Hospice use more than doubled during the decade (from 12% to 29% among patients diagnosed in 1991 and 1999, respectively; p < 0.0001), mostly among the oldest patients. Administration of chemotherapy also increased from 29% of patients diagnosed in 1991 to 38% of patients diagnosed in 1999 (p = 0.014), with the increase being seen mostly among younger patients and those treated in teaching hospitals. Average total costs (+/- SD) were US$51,888 +/- $54,825 and declined by age as a result of lower survival. A total of 192 patients (16% of treated patients) relapsed and received retreatment with chemotherapy. These patients survived a median 18 months, with a median duration of remission of 8 months, and average total costs three times higher than the overall sample. CONCLUSIONS: The high early mortality and costs associated with AML have not changed significantly over the past decade. However, treatment patterns appear to be changing, with increasing use of chemotherapy and hospice care. The ongoing introduction of new treatments for AML in the elderly is likely to further impact treatment patterns, and may change the economic burden of the disease. Our findings can be used as a baseline against which the benefits of new therapies can be compared.","['Lang, Kathleen', 'Earle, Craig C', 'Foster, Talia', 'Dixon, Deirdre', 'Van Gool, Renilt', 'Menzin, Joseph']","['Lang K', 'Earle CC', 'Foster T', 'Dixon D', 'Van Gool R', 'Menzin J']","['Boston Health Economics, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts 02451, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Therapy/economics/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Female', 'Health Expenditures', 'Hospice Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/economics/mortality', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/03/11 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['22114 [pii]', '10.2165/00002512-200522110-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2005;22(11):943-55. doi: 10.2165/00002512-200522110-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanistic basis and substrate specificity for this sequestration have not been rigorously evaluated; however, conditions are favorable for a pH-partitioning type accumulation. In some circumstances, this compartmentalization can be very extensive, which can impact the therapeutic efficacy of a drug. Despite the pharmaceutical importance, direct quantitative assessments of drug accumulation in lysosomes have not been previously described. We report here a novel magnetic capture technique that allows for quick and efficient isolation of lysosomes from cultured HL-60 cells that have been preincubated with model compounds. The amount of compound associated with the isolated fraction is determined by HPLC. Extensive biochemical and morphological characterizations of isolated lysosomes, together with HPLC data, allowed for estimates to be made regarding the concentration of model compounds in lysosomes. The corresponding theoretically determined concentration values, based on pH-partitioning theory, were also calculated for comparison purposes. Interestingly, experimentally determined values were approximately 3-15 times higher than theoretically predicted values. This finding suggests that mechanisms, in addition to pH-partitioning, may play a significant role in the accumulation of drugs in lysosomes.","['Duvvuri, Muralikrishna', 'Krise, Jeffrey P']","['Duvvuri M', 'Krise JP']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas 66047, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Quinacrine/*pharmacokinetics']",,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/mp050043s [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2005 Nov-Dec;2(6):440-8. doi: 10.1021/mp050043s.,['CA106655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic subgroups with distinct clinical features have been identified, such as the 11q deletion that is associated with marked lymphadenopathy and rapid disease progression, while the 17p deletion predicts treatment failure with alkylating agents as well as fludarabine and short survival times. On the other hand, there is the mutation status of the VH genes that allows the separation of patients into long (mutated VH) or short (unmutated VH) survival times. V-gene usage, VDJ structure, and gene expression differences in the two subgroups allow insights into differential pathogenic mechanisms and provide further prognostic information (V3-21 usage, ZAP-70 expression). Most importantly, the VH mutation status and genomic abnormalities have been shown to be of independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis, appear to allow outcome predication irrespective of the clinical stage, and may therefore allow a risk assessment of individual patients early in the course of the disease.","['Stilgenbauer, S', 'Dohner, H']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner H']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany. stephan.stilgenbauer@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects']",43,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/3-540-29933-5_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2005;294:147-64. doi: 10.1007/3-540-29933-5_9.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent studies have shown that 50%-70% of CLL harbour somatic mutations of VH genes, as if they had matured in a lymphoid follicle. Interestingly, the presence or absence of somatic hypermutation (SHM) process is associated with the use of particular VH genes. Particular alleles of the VH1-69 gene and the VH4-39 gene are preferentially expressed in an unmutated form, while VH4-34 or the majority of VH3 family genes frequently contain somatic mutations. The fact that some genes like VH1-69 and VH3-07 recombine this VH segment to particular JH segments and the restricted use of CDR3 sequences by CLLs expressing the VH4-39 gene suggest that the observed differences in BCR structure in B-CLL could result from selection by distinct antigenic epitopes. It is currently unclear whether this putative antigen-driven process could occur prior to leukaemic transformation and/or that the precursors were transformed into leukaemic cells at distinct maturational stages. The mutational profile of Ig genes has been shown to be associated with disease prognosis. These results could favour the idea that CLL could correspond to two different diseases that look alike in morphologic and phenotypic terms. In CLL with mutated Ig genes, the proliferating B cell may have transited through germinal centres, the physiologic site of hypermutation, whereas in CLL with unmutated Ig genes the malignant B cell may derive from a pre-germinal centre naive B cell. Despite these clinical and molecular differences, recent studies on gene expression profiling of B-CLL cells showed that CLL is characterized by a common gene expression signature that is irrespective of Ig mutational status and differs from other lymphoid cancers and normal lymphoid subpopulations, suggesting that CLL cases share a common mechanism of transformation and/or cell of origin. Activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) plays a key role in SHM and class switch recombination (CSR). However, the mechanisms accounting for AID action and control of its expression remain unclear. In a recent work we have shown that in contrast to normal circulating B-cells, AID transcripts are expressed constitutively in CLL patients undergoing active CSR, but interestingly this expression occurs predominately in unmutated CLL B-cells. These data favour the view that AID protein may act differentially on CSR and SHM pathways, but the role-played by AID in both processes remains to be elucidated. Recent work indicates that AID is expressed in a small fraction of tumoral cells, which could suggest that this small fraction of cells may correspond to B-CLL cells that would have recently experienced an AID-inducing stimulus occurring in a specific microenvironment.","['Oppezzo, P', 'Dighiero, G']","['Oppezzo P', 'Dighiero G']","[""Service d'Immuno-Hematologie, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Models, Biological', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin']",71,2005/12/06 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/12/06 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/3-540-29933-5_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2005;294:71-89. doi: 10.1007/3-540-29933-5_5.,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used VPA in 58 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were too old and/or medically unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy (32 AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], 22 de novo AML, 4 AML secondary to myeloproliferative syndrome). VPA serum concentrations were 50-100 mug/mL. Thirty-one patients received VPA monotherapy. ATRA was added later in 13 patients who did not respond or who relapsed. Another 27 patients received VPA plus ATRA from the start. Median treatment duration was 93 days for VPA and 88 days for ATRA. RESULTS: The response rate was only 5% according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria for AML but was 16% when IWG response criteria for MDS were used, which capture hematologic improvement and stabilization of the disease.

Here, we have used genetic linkage analysis to identify a novel mHAg, designated lymphoid-restricted histocompatibility antigen-1 (LRH-1), which is encoded by the P2X5 gene and elicited an allogeneic CTL response in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia after donor lymphocyte infusion. We demonstrate that immunogenicity for LRH-1 is due to differential protein expression in recipient and donor cells as a consequence of a homozygous frameshift polymorphism in the donor. Tetramer analysis showed that emergence of LRH-1-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow correlated with complete remission of chronic myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, the restricted expression of LRH-1 in hematopoietic cells including leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells provides evidence of a role for LRH-1-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in selective graft-versus-leukemia reactivity in the absence of severe graft-versus-host disease. These findings illustrate that the P2X5-encoded mHAg LRH-1 could be an attractive target for specific immunotherapy to treat hematological malignancies recurring after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['de Rijke, Bjorn', 'van Horssen-Zoetbrood, Agnes', 'Beekman, Jeffrey M', 'Otterud, Britt', 'Maas, Frans', 'Woestenenk, Rob', 'Kester, Michel', 'Leppert, Mark', 'Schattenberg, Anton V', 'de Witte, Theo', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade, Elly', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['de Rijke B', 'van Horssen-Zoetbrood A', 'Beekman JM', 'Otterud B', 'Maas F', 'Woestenenk R', 'Kester M', 'Leppert M', 'Schattenberg AV', 'de Witte T', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade E', 'Dolstra H']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Female', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'HLA-B Antigens/chemistry', 'HLA-B7 Antigen', 'Haplotypes', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/chemistry', 'Lod Score', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Pedigree', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Plasmids/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X5', 'Recurrence', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/02/07 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI24832 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2005 Dec;115(12):3506-16. doi: 10.1172/JCI24832.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B*07:02 antigen)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (P2RX5 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X5)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",['J Clin Invest. 2005 Dec;115(12):3397-400.

V3-21 cases showed characteristic expression differences compared to VH-MUT (up: ZAP70 [or ZAP-70]; down: CCND2, P27) and VH-UM (down: PI3K, CCND2, P27, CDK4, BAX) involving several BCR-related genes. Similarly, there was a marked difference between VH unmutated cases using the V1-69 gene and VH-UM (up: FOS; down: BLNK, SYK, CDK4, TP53).

We investigated the role of PARP-1 in the response to topo I poisons using PARP-1-/- and PARP-1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts and the potent PARP-1 inhibitor, AG14361 (Ki < 5 nmol/L). PARP-1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were 3-fold more sensitive to topotecan than PARP-1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (GI50, 21 and 65 nmol/L, respectively). AG14361 caused a >3-fold sensitization of PARP-1+/+ cells to topotecan compared with a <1.4-fold sensitization in PARP-1-/- cells. In human leukemia K562 cells, AG14361 caused a 2-fold sensitization to camptothecin-induced cytotoxicity. AG14361 did not affect the cellular activity of topo I as determined by measurement of cleavable complexes and topo I relaxation activity, showing that sensitization was not due to topo I activation. In contrast, repair of DNA following camptothecin removal, normally very rapid, was significantly retarded by AG14361, resulting in a 62% inhibition of repair 10 minutes after camptothecin removal. This led to a 20% increase in the net accumulation of camptothecin-induced DNA strand break levels in cells coexposed to AG14361 for 16 hours. We investigated the DNA repair mechanism involved using a panel of DNA repair-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. AG14361 significantly potentiated camptothecin-mediated cytotoxicity in all cells, except the base excision repair-deficient EM9 cells. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for the potentiation of topo I poison-mediated cytotoxicity by AG14361 is via PARP-1-dependent base excision repair.","['Smith, Lisa M', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Austin, Caroline A', 'Curtin, Nicola J']","['Smith LM', 'Willmore E', 'Austin CA', 'Curtin NJ']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research and Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Azulenes', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*toxicity', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topotecan/*toxicity', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/23/8449 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1224 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Dec 1;11(23):8449-57. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1224.,,"['0 (1-(4-dimethylaminomethylphenyl)-8,9-dihydro-7H-2,7,9a-benzo(cd)azulen-6-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Azulenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to preserve CD4 counts, we conducted a phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) added to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in patients with treatment-naive indolent lymphomas or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Subcutaneous IL-2 (days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) was combined with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2, day 8) and fludarabine (20 mg/m2, days 8-12) at four dose levels: 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 x 10(6) IU/m2/d. IL-2 dose was escalated in cohorts of four to six patients, with one patient per cohort receiving placebo. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients, median age 50, were enrolled, of whom 30% had chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and 52% had follicular lymphomas. The combination was generally well tolerated, with mainly hematologic toxicities. CD4 counts typically declined substantially during the early weeks of treatment and remained suppressed for months afterward. In the 18 evaluable patients who received IL-2, the mean absolute CD4 count was 999 cells/microL (range, 97-3,776) pretreatment, 379 cells/microL (range, 54-2,599) at day 14, and 98 cells/microL (range, 17-291) at end of treatment. In longitudinal linear models, the changes in CD4 counts were not significantly different across IL-2 dose levels. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of low-dose IL-2 to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide does not seem immunoprotective. New approaches are needed to reduce the cellular immunosuppression and infectious complications associated with purine analogues.","['Kasamon, Yvette L', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Diehl, Louis F', 'Garrett-Mayer, Elizabeth', 'Goodman, Steven N', 'Lucas, Margaret S', 'Byrd, John C']","['Kasamon YL', 'Flinn IW', 'Grever MR', 'Diehl LF', 'Garrett-Mayer E', 'Goodman SN', 'Lucas MS', 'Byrd JC']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA. ykasamo1@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/23/8413 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1612 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Dec 1;11(23):8413-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1612.,['P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",['J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan 1;28(1):e8.

We designed a phase I clinical trial using a timed sequential therapy approach where flavopiridol was given for the dual purpose of initial cytoreduction and enhancing cell cycle progression of the remaining leukemia cell cohort followed by cycle-dependent drugs 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and mitoxantrone. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Flavopiridol was given by 1-hour infusion daily for 3 days beginning day 1 followed by 2 g/m2/72 h ara-C beginning day 6 and 40 mg/m2 mitoxantrone beginning day 9. In vivo correlates included pharmacokinetics, modulation of blast cycle regulators, and serum and marrow supernatant vascular endothelial growth factor levels. RESULTS: Of 34 adults receiving induction therapy, 16 (47%) evinced direct leukemia cytotoxicity with > or =50% drop in peripheral blast counts and tumor lysis in 9 (26%). Four (12%) died during therapy (two fungal infections and two sudden death). Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 60 mg/m2/d with profound neutropenia >40 days duration, and maximal tolerated dose was 50 mg/m2/d. Overall response rate was 31% in 26 acute myelogenous leukemia and 12.5% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pharmacokinetics showed that a linear two-compartment model with first-order elimination provided the best fit of the observed concentration versus time data. Flavopiridol down-regulated one or more target proteins in marrow blasts in vivo. Vascular endothelial growth factor was detected in sera and marrow supernatant pretreatment, and sera obtained on day 3 inhibited bovine aortic endothelial cell proliferation by a mean of 32% (range, 10-80%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that flavopiridol is cytotoxic to leukemic cells and, when followed by ara-C and mitoxantrone, exerts biological and clinical effects in patients with relapsed and refractory acute leukemias. These findings warrant continuing development of flavopiridol at 50 mg/m2/d x 3 days in combination with cytotoxic and biological agents for acute leukemias.","['Karp, Judith E', 'Passaniti, Antonino', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Kaufmann, Scott', 'Bible, Keith', 'Garimella, Tushar S', 'Greer, Jacqueline', 'Briel, Janet', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Tidwell, Michael L', 'Ross, Douglas D', 'Wright, John J', 'Colevas, A Dimitrios', 'Bauer, Kenneth S']","['Karp JE', 'Passaniti A', 'Gojo I', 'Kaufmann S', 'Bible K', 'Garimella TS', 'Greer J', 'Briel J', 'Smith BD', 'Gore SD', 'Tidwell ML', 'Ross DD', 'Wright JJ', 'Colevas AD', 'Bauer KS']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Salvage Therapy', 'U937 Cells', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/23/8403 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1201 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Dec 1;11(23):8403-12. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1201.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about its genetic features. In this study, we examined the genes expressed by SNK-6 and SNT-8 cells, which were established from nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas, and found that interleukin (IL)-9 was specifically expressed in these two cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: cDNA array was used to examine the genes expressed by SNK-6 and SNT-8 cells. Expression of IL-9 and IL-9 receptor was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry. Cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Immunohistologic staining and ELISA were used to examine IL-9 expression in biopsies and sera from patients, respectively. RESULTS: In cDNA array, expression of IL-9 mRNA was much higher in SNK-6 and SNT-8 cells than in NK-92 cells from non-nasal NK-cell lymphoma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers. Furthermore, IL-9 was specifically expressed by SNK-6 and SNT-8 cells but not by other NK-cell, NK-like T-cell, and T-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines. IL-9 receptor was also expressed on the surfaces of SNK-6 and SNT-8 cells.

The mitochondrial permeability transition pore consists mainly of the mitochondrial outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and the mitochondrial inner membrane adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). These mitochondrial proteins are responsible for the permeability transition that leads to apoptosis. In the present study, the human leukemia cell line, Reh, was treated with PDT using hexaminolevulinate (HAL). More than 80% of apoptotic Reh cells were found after HAL-mediated PDT (HAL-PDT) with high-molecular-weight (50 kbp) DNA fragmentation. Addition of PK11195 or Ro5-4864, two ligands of PBR, during HAL-PDT significantly inhibited the apoptotic effect. Bongkrekic acid, a ligand for ANT, also reduced the PDT effect. Although the mitochondrial transmembrane potential collapsed, neither cytosolic translocation of mitochondrial cytochrome c nor activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were found. However, nuclear translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was shown by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Because AIF is the sole one among all proapoptotic factors involved in caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways that induces the high-molecular-weight DNA fragmentation, we conclude that HAL-PDT specifically targets PBR, leading to apoptosis of the Reh cells through nuclear translocation of mitochondrial AIF. This study suggests PBR as a possible novel therapeutic target for HAL-based PDT of cancer.","['Furre, Ingegerd Eggen', 'Shahzidi, Susan', 'Luksiene, Zivile', 'Moller, Michael T N', 'Borgen, Elin', 'Morgan, Janet', 'Tkacz-Stachowska, Kinga', 'Nesland, Jahn M', 'Peng, Qian']","['Furre IE', 'Shahzidi S', 'Luksiene Z', 'Moller MT', 'Borgen E', 'Morgan J', 'Tkacz-Stachowska K', 'Nesland JM', 'Peng Q']","['Department of Pathology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, GABA/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/01/26 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/23/11051 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0510 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Dec 1;65(23):11051-60. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0510.,,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Receptors, GABA)', '0 (TSPO protein, human)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'G7H20TKI67 (5-aminolevulinic acid hexyl ester)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML localizes predominantly to PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NB), nuclear macromolecular complexes regulating tumor suppressor protein p53 activity. Consistent with the function of PML in the cellular antiviral response, PML-NBs represent preferential targets in viral infections. In the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, important characteristics are nonresponsiveness to IFN therapy and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms which lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma are largely unknown. Here, we show that HCV core protein localizes to the cell nucleus in PML-NBs, where it colocalizes with p53. The HCV core interacts with endogenously expressed PML isoform IV (PML-IV), a key regulator of p53 activity. Importantly, we show that HCV core protein inhibits PML-IV-induced apoptosis and interferes with the coactivator function of PML-IV for proapoptotic p53 target genes including CD95 (Fas/APO-1). In particular, we found that the HCV core inhibits p53-mediated target gene expression by predominantly targeting the coactivator function of PML-IV because HCV core-mediated p53 target gene repression was absent in PML-ablated cells. HCV core expression abrogated both p53 serine 15 phosphorylation and lysine 382 acetylation, two p53-activating posttranslational modifications which were previously linked to an increased PML-NB formation. Taken together, our results suggest a potential mechanism for HCV-associated development of hepatocellular carcinoma through HCV core-mediated inactivation of the PML tumor suppressor pathway.","['Herzer, Kerstin', 'Weyer, Sandra', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Galle, Peter R', 'Hofmann, Thomas G']","['Herzer K', 'Weyer S', 'Krammer PH', 'Galle PR', 'Hofmann TG']","['I.

In combination with transgenic and knockout technologies, large-scale mouse mutagenesis is a powerful approach for the identification of new genes and associated signalling pathways controlling neuronal cell death and survival. Here we review the characterization of the robotic mouse, a novel model of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia isolated from an ENU-mutagenesis programme, which develops adult-onset region-specific Purkinje cell loss and cataracts, and displays defects in early T-cell maturation and general growth retardation. The mutated protein, Af4, is a member of the AF4/LAF4/FMR2 (ALF) family of putative transcription factors previously implicated in childhood leukaemia and FRAXE mental retardation. The mutation, which lies in a highly conserved region among the ALF family members, significantly reduces the binding affinity of Af4 to the E3 ubiquitin-ligase Siah-1a, isolated with Siah-2 as interacting proteins in the brain. This leads to a markedly slower turnover of mutant Af4 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and consequently to its abnormal accumulation in the robotic mouse. Importantly, the conservation of the Siah-binding domain of Af4 in all other family members reveals that Siah-mediated proteasomal degradation is a common regulatory mechanism that controls the levels, and thereby the function, of the ALF family. The robotic mouse represents a unique model in which to study the newly revealed role of Af4 in the maintenance of vital functions of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and further the understanding of its implication in lymphopoeisis.","['Bitoun, Emmanuelle', 'Davies, Kay Elizabeth']","['Bitoun E', 'Davies KE']","['MRC Functional Genetics Unit, Department of Human Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cerebellum,"Cerebellum (London, England)",101089443,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cerebellum/*metabolism/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/etiology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",110,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['LM4T2452552223RX [pii]', '10.1080/14734220500325897 [doi]']",ppublish,Cerebellum. 2005;4(4):250-60. doi: 10.1080/14734220500325897.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (DC) represents a potentially important development in the field of cancer vaccination. B-CLL is ideally suited for DC-based vaccination since tumor cells are readily available (peripheral blood) and both known (tumor idiotype) and unknown antigens can be exploited to stimulate immune responses. In the current study we have evaluated the ability to stimulate in vitro autologous immune reactivity against target B-CLL cells using autologous DCs pulsed with B-CLL tumor lysate. Enhanced specific T cell IFN-gamma expression was detected in 9 of 14 patients evaluated. These responses were specific with increased levels of IFN-gamma mRNA measurable in T-cells stimulated with NC-DCs and not unpulsed DCs or DCs pulsed with normal B cell lysate. CTLs demonstrating increased levels of IFN-gamma mRNA also lysed autologous B-CLL targets cells in an MHC class 1-restricted manner by (51)chromium release assay. Priming target leukemic cells with CD40 ligand and IL-4 enhanced CTL killing.

By contrast, B-CLL is rare in Asians, including Japanese. We applied comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to screen 26 newly diagnosed Japanese B-CLL patients for genomic aberrations. Chromosomal imbalances were detected in 12 of the 26 cases (46%). The most frequent changes observed were gains of chromosomes 3q in five cases (19%) and 17q in three cases (12%). Other recurrent imbalances included gains of chromosomes 8q, 18q and losses of chromosomes 13q and 17p. Samples obtained at different sites disclosed identical CGH findings in all of the three cases examined. Genomic imbalances as detected by CGH were associated with disease progression and shorter survival. Two patients, with chromosomal imbalances, including gains of both 3q and 18q, developed large cell transformation of the disease within 4 years. In conclusion, CGH abnormality was associated with poor prognosis in Japanese B-CLL, and features of Japanese B-CLL, compared to chromosomal abnormalities of Western B-CLL in the literature, include a lower incidence of any abnormality in particular regarding gain of 12q, with the exception of a higher incidence of gains at 3q.","['Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Lohr, Dirk', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Jauch, Anna']","['Tsukasaki K', 'Lohr D', 'Sugahara K', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Bartram CR', 'Jauch A']","['Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Nagasaki, Japan. tsukasak@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/06/21 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['W42R72N05RQ14MQ6 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500287828 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Feb;47(2):261-6. doi: 10.1080/10428190500287828.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to determine the prognostic significance of the immunohistochemical expression of ZAP-70 protein in CLL by means of the long-term follow-up of 108 patients. This study identified 3 patterns of ZAP-70 immunoreactivity: negative (58 patients, 54%), weakly positive (20 patients, 18%) and strongly positive (30 patients, 28%). Overall, ZAP-70 immunoreactivity correlated with an abnormal karyotype ( p = 0.017), a lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of <6 months ( p = 0.001) and <12 months ( p = 0.01), Rai II - IV and Binet B - C stage ( p = 0.013), the clinical need for chemotherapy ( p < 0.001) and the need for more than 1 chemotherapy line ( p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that ZAP-70 immunoreactivity closely correlated with a shorter LDT ( p < 0.0001) and time from diagnosis to initial therapy ( p = 0.0001). The same significance was retained when the patients were stratified into the ZAP-70 immunoreactivity groups ( p < 0.0001).

However, the molecular pathways that are relevant to tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, we screened for common chromosome abnormalities [13q14 del, 11q22.3 (ATM) del, 17p13 (p53) del and trisomy 12] by fluorescent in situ hybridization in 40 B-CLL patients. Each of the four chromosome abnormality groups was compared to several clinical factors related to lymphocyte behaviour in CLL. The 11q22.3 (ATM) deletion group was significantly associated with the presence of bulky abdominal/mediastinal lymphadenopathy (P = 0.014). We hypothesized that this phenotype would be associated with an altered transcription pattern of genes. Class comparison analysis by significance analysis of microarrays on a subset of CLL samples (n = 14) indicated that a number of cell surface receptor and adhesion related genes were under-expressed in the 11q22.3 deletion group (CD44, CD11a, PTPRC, CD79a, chemokine ligand 17 and chemokine receptor type 6). The presence of additional prognostic factors, such as CD38 and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutational status, may also influence the transcriptional pathways between the two groups. Therefore, we employed a novel analysis technique for the correlation of log(2) gene expression ratios with the percentage of each tumor that carried the 11q22.3 deletion. Using Spearman's correlation, ZAP-70, chemokine ligand 17, BSAP (PAX5), CD7, LAG3 and PTPR6 were significantly correlated with the percentage of cells with the 11q22.3 deletion. However, the down-regulation of cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules observed by class comparison could not be confirmed to be specific for the 11q22.3 deletion by this method.","['Dickinson, John D', 'Gilmore, Jamie', 'Iqbal, Javeed', 'Sanger, Warren', 'Lynch, James C', 'Chan, John', 'Bierman, Philip J', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Dickinson JD', 'Gilmore J', 'Iqbal J', 'Sanger W', 'Lynch JC', 'Chan J', 'Bierman PJ', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Genetics, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, 68198-6395, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphatic Diseases/complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Trisomy', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/06/21 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['T24H0283Q155L447 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500254141 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Feb;47(2):231-44. doi: 10.1080/10428190500254141.,,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the NOD/SCID mouse-repopulating leukemic stem cells usually co-express CD123 with CD34, but lack CD38. So far, however, little is known about expression of other markers and targets on these progenitors. In the present study, expression of target antigens on CD34+/CD38- cells was analysed by multi-color flow cytometry in patients with AML (n = 18), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, n = 6), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 8) and systemic mastocytosis (SM, n = 9). The IL-3Ralpha chain (CD123) was found to be expressed on CD34+/CD38- cells in a majority of the patients in all disease categories. Independent of the type of disease, the vast majority of these stem cells co-expressed aminopeptidase-N (CD13) and CD44 in all patients. By contrast, the CD34+/CD38- progenitor cells expressed variable amounts of the target receptor CD33, c-kit (CD117) and AC133 (CD133). In conclusion, neoplastic stem cells in various myeloid neoplasms appear to express a similar phenotype including target antigens such as CD13, CD33 and CD44. Since many of these targets are not expressed on all stem cells in all patients, the elimination of the entire clone may require combinations of targeted antibodies or use of additional drugs.","['Florian, Stefan', 'Sonneck, Karoline', 'Hauswirth, Alexander W', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Schernthaner, Gerit-Holger', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Florian S', 'Sonneck K', 'Hauswirth AW', 'Krauth MT', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*analysis/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis/genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Stem Cells/*immunology']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/06/21 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['G0W721H1N35Q7453 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500272507 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Feb;47(2):207-22. doi: 10.1080/10428190500272507.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until very recently, the only TK mutations widely observed in myeloid neoplasia were the BCR/ABL1 fusions characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia and some acute leukemias, and FLT3 activating mutations in a minority of acute myeloid leukemias. Several rare TK mutations are found in various atypical myeloproliferative disorders, but big pieces of the pathobiological puzzle were glaringly missing. In the first half of 2005, one gap was filled in: 7 studies identified the same acquired amino acid substitution (V617F) in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) TK in large numbers of patients with diverse clonal myeloid disorders. Most affected patients suffer from the classic BCR/ABL1-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), especially polycythemia vera (74% of n = 506), but a subset of people with essential thrombocythemia (36% of n = 339) or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (44% of n = 127) bear the identical mutation, as do a few individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or an atypical myeloid disorder (7% of n = 556). This long-sought common mutation in BCR/ABL1-negative MPD raises many provocative biological and clinical questions, and demands re-evaluation of prevailing diagnostic algorithms for erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis. JAK2 V617F may provide novel molecular targets for drug therapy, and suggests other places to seek cooperating mutations or mutations associated with similar phenotypes.

Little is known of the molecular pathogenesis of MDS or of the mechanism of its stage progression. DNA micro-array analysis, which allows simultaneous monitoring of the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes, has the potential to provide insight into the pathophysiology of MDS. Several studies have applied this new technology to compare gene expression profiles either between MDS and the healthy condition, among the different stages of MDS or between MDS-derived AML and de novo AML. Selection of an appropriate hematopoietic fraction is important for such studies, which to date have been performed with differentiated granulocytes, CD34+ progenitors and CD133+ immature cells. These studies have revealed that each stage of MDS has its own 'molecular signature', indicating the feasibility of differential diagnosis of MDS based on gene expression profile.

Such cures presumably result from the combined effects of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) of the conditioning regimen and the graft-vs.-leukemia (GvL) effect mediated by donor-derived T lymphocytes. The advent of imatinib has revolutionized the management of patients with CML, but much evidence suggests that it does not eradicate all LSCs, which theoretically remain a potential source of relapse to chronic phase or advanced phase disease. Moreover, sub-clones of Philadelphia-positive cells bearing mutations that code for amino-acid substitutions in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain can be identified in patients receiving treatment with imatinib and are associated with varying degrees of resistance to this agent. In the present review, we postulate that LSCs, similar to their normal counterparts, may alternate between cycling and quiescent modes. In the cycling mode, they may express Bcr-Abl protein and be susceptible to the acquisition of additional mutations, whereas, in the quiescent mode, they may express little or no Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, cannot acquire additional mutations and are unaffected by imatinib. Thus, a patient who starts treatment early in the natural history of CML, and who responds to imatinib clinically, may not have had the opportunity to acquire additional mutations in LSCs. In this case, the persistence long-term of quiescent 'non-mutated' LSCs despite imatinib treatment might be consistent with freedom from relapse to chronic or advanced phase disease, provided that they remain vulnerable to imatinib when they are recruited into cycle. Conversely, when imatinib resistant Philadelphia-positive sub-clones predominate, this is likely to be due to the recruitment to hematopoiesis of quiescent stem cells that had been in cycle before administration of imatinib and that had acquired additional mutations; in such cases, the best approach to eradication of residual LSCs might be to target expressed proteins thought to be targets for the GvL effect.","['Goldman, John', 'Gordon, Myrtle']","['Goldman J', 'Gordon M']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA. goldmanj2@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",61,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/04/07 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['H57841JV43U26245 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500407996 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jan;47(1):1-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190500407996.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of clinical records from consecutive patients having open or laparoscopic removal of the spleen in an academic centre in the private sector. Endpoints were survival, operating time, spleen size, histopathology, requirements for blood or related products complications and average costs. RESULTS: In the total group (n = 69) there were two deaths. Referrals were for immune thrombocytopaenia (41%), acquired haemolytic anaemia (10%), myeloproliferative syndrome (9%), acute or chronic leukaemia (19%), lymphoma (13%) and a miscellaneous group (8%), comprising cholelithiasis, aplasia or as a diagnostic procedure for otherwise unexplained splenomegaly. An open midline approach was predicated by spleens greater than twice normal size and a history of any bleeding disorder. Here the mean operating time was 83 min (range 40-295) whereas for laparoscopy this was 251 min (range 181-272). SUMMARY: Careful stratification between the two options facilitated optimum haemostasis and consequently reduced requirement for packed red cells and platelets.

In this work, the effects of endothelial coculture on acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blast survival is examined as are the effects of endothelial coculture on the impact of a cytotoxic agent such as cytarabine. Similar to marrow stromal cells, endothelial cells are able to increase survival and proliferation of AML blasts and to partially protect against cytarabine effects. The proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has inhibitory effects in multiple myeloma in part through effects on marrow stromal cells. Bortezomib has been found to inhibit AML blast survival. Such inhibition is less, however, in the presence of endothelial monolayers. Furthermore, AML blast transmigration through human umbilical vein endothelial cells is inhibited by bortezomib. These studies demonstrate that AML is subject to influence of endothelial cells and of agents such as bortezomib which have potential impact on AML interaction with the microenvironmental niche.","['Liesveld, Jane L', 'Rosell, Karen E', 'Lu, Chaohui', 'Bechelli, Jeremy', 'Phillips, Gordon', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Abboud, Camille N']","['Liesveld JL', 'Rosell KE', 'Lu C', 'Bechelli J', 'Phillips G', 'Lancet JE', 'Abboud CN']","['University of Rochester, University of Rochester Medical Center, Department of Medicine and the James P.

RESULTS: The frequency of GSTM1 null genotype in the AML patients was 62.3%, significantly higher than that in the normal controls (52.7%, P = 0.036), however, no significant difference was found in the incidence of GSTT1 null genotype. The frequencies of NQO1(C609T) C/T and T/T genotypes were 53.1% and 25.0% respectively among the total AML patients (53.1% and 25.0% respectively), 64.3% and 25.0% respectively among the AML patients with t (8; 21) (q22; q22)/AML-ETO fusion gene, and 57.1% and 26.0% respectively among the AML patient with t (15; 17) (q22; q11)/PML-RARalpha fusion gene, all significantly higher than those in the controls (49.4% and 13.7% respectively).

While QU mainly exerts its anticancer activity through scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), the anticancer activity of TSA was attributed to its inhibition on histone deacetylases (HDAC). In the present study it was investigated, whether the combination of QU and TSA could improve their anticancer activity against human leukemia cells (HL-60). The cytotoxicity of QU and TSA increased in a time and dose-dependent manner. QU (10, 20 and 40 microM) was able to diminish the ROS generation (indicated by the level of malondialdehyde, MDA) but showed no influence on the histone acetylation in HL-60 cells; on the contrary, TSA (20, 40, 80 and 160 nM) showed no inhibition on ROS generation but significantly increased the histone acetylation, indicating the possible role of both scavenging ROS and increasing histone acetylation in the induction of cell death in HL-60 cells. This conclusion was confirmed by the findings that the combinations of QU and TSA at different concentrations could not only diminish ROS generation, but also increase histone acetylation, and hence showed more significant cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells than either of its components. Collectively, the present data indicate that a combination of QU and TSA can cooperatively kill HL-60 cells through the combination of their activities of scavenging ROS and increasing histone acetylation.","['Chen, Jie', 'Kang, Jiu-Hong']","['Chen J', 'Kang JH']","['School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",,2005/12/03 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/12/03 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2005 Nov;60(11):856-60.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA)/IL-1-induced arthritis was elicited in wild-type, gene-knockout, and monoclonal antibody-treated mice. Synovial lining macrophages were selectively depleted by intraarticular injection of clodronate liposomes prior to disease induction. The severity of arthritis was assessed histologically. RESULTS: Mice deficient in IL-2 were almost completely protected from arthritis, and neutralization of IL-4 reduced the severity of disease. In contrast, arthritis severity and resolution appeared to be independent of IFNgamma. Synovial lining macrophage depletion markedly reduced arthritis severity. IL-6 or LIF deficiency was only modestly protective, although as previously reported, GM-CSF deficiency conferred profound disease resistance. IL-12 p40-deficient mice (which lack IL-12 and IL-23) and OSM receptor-deficient mice were susceptible to mBSA/IL-1-induced arthritis. CONCLUSION: Acute mBSA/IL-1-induced arthritis is dependent on IL-2 and IL-4, but not IFNgamma. In vivo, the Th1/Th2 paradigm may be distorted by the presence of macrophage-derived cytokines such as IL-1. Synovial lining macrophages are essential in mBSA/IL-1-induced arthritis. However, the requirement for macrophage-derived cytokines is selective; that is, IL-6, LIF, and especially GM-CSF are necessary, but IL-12, IL-23, and OSM are dispensable. IL-1 may therefore influence both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms in acute inflammatory arthritis.","['Lawlor, Kate E', 'Wong, Peter K K', 'Campbell, Ian K', 'van Rooijen, Nico', 'Wicks, Ian P']","['Lawlor KE', 'Wong PK', 'Campbell IK', 'van Rooijen N', 'Wicks IP']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Arthritis/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*genetics/*immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Interleukin-12/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-12 Subunit p40', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/immunology', 'Joints/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macrophages/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics/immunology']",,2005/12/02 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/12/02 09:00'],"['2005/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.21495 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2005 Dec;52(12):3749-54. doi: 10.1002/art.21495.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-12 Subunit p40)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '0 (methylated bovine serum albumin)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, we are not yet able to deal in complete generality with these complex data, which frequently consist of error-prone, sparse and intermittent values. In many cancer studies, they arise in the framework of clinical trials and thus their relationship with prognosis is a primary focus. In such a setting, the Cox model is regarded as the standard technique for analysis. The aim of this work is to illustrate an alternative approach to the analysis of studies in which the biomarker values are complicated by interval censoring and an event occurs when the biomarker itself passes a certain threshold. We propose a linear mixed model with a Gaussian stochastic process that allows for interval-censored data and can be used both to track the biomarker trajectory and to estimate the probability of event occurrence. It is developed within the classic approach to longitudinal data analysis that was previously adapted for left-censored data, only. We apply this method to a study on the minimal residual disease (MRD) in childhood leukaemia. MRD is an interval-censored measurement of residual leukaemic cells that was scheduled at 9 time-points during treatment. The aim is to investigate the relationship between MRD and the disease process. Relapse, the event of interest, may conveniently be represented as MRD over a pre-defined threshold.

We analyzed 656 AML patients for a recently described single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the third immunoglobulin-like domain of the extracellular region of FLT3. The FLT3 D324N variant was present in 42 cases (6.4%), but it was not associated with a specific AML subtype and did not show an elevated leukocyte count, as do other FLT3 mutations. In remission samples, a 50% ratio of the normal to the D324N variant was detectable. Stably expressed in IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 cells, the D324N variant did not confer receptor autophosphorylation, factor independent growth, or increased resistance to apoptotic cell death in response to varying doses of FLT3 ligand. In 400 healthy donors, the FLT3 D324N variant was detected in 6 cases (1.5%) and segregated in a family. Thus, it was shown to be a polymorphism with a lower frequency in healthy controls than in patients with AML (P < 0.001). In addition, 21 of 234 CML (9.0%) and 7 of 155 ALL (4.5%) cases carried the FLT3 D324N.

In this work, the effects of both diterpenes on the kinetic properties of the recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme were evaluated. RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase (RDDP) activity assays demonstrated that both diterpenes behave as non-competitive inhibitors with respect to dTTP and uncompetitive inhibitors with respect to poly(rA).oligo(dT) template primers. The K(i) values obtained for compounds 1 and 2 were 10 and 35 microM, respectively. Neither of these diterpenes affected the DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase (DDDP) activity of the HIV-1 RT. The RDDP activities of AMV-RT and MMLV-RT enzymes were also inhibited by compounds 1 and 2. In contrast to the HIV-1 enzyme, the DDDP activities of AMV-RT and MMLV-RT enzymes were significantly reduced by compound 1. Taken together, our results demonstrate that compound 1 is a more effective inhibitor of the viral reverse transcriptases from HIV-1, AMV and MMLV than compound 2.

Treatment with the compounds resulted in activation of caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-8. A broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases, Z-Asp-CH (2)-DCB, attenuated the cytotoxicity induced by these compounds, suggesting that JA, JB, JC and JD induced apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway.

Significant associations between CD117 and CD34 (P<0.001), CD13 (P=0.006), CD7 (P=0.034), and CD19 (P<0.001) were found in AML cases. The calculated specificity of CD117 for the diagnosis of AML was 0.97, which was higher than CD13 (0.78) and CD33 (0.75) but comparable to MPO (0.97). The positive predictive value (PPV) of CD117 for AML was 0.99, with the negative predictive value of 0.35. In conclusion, the majority of Thai adult AML cases expressed c-kit.

However, it is still not clear whether methylation in mononuclear cells is disease specific. In the present study, we investigated whether methylation of the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (INK) 4A/alternative reading frame (ARF) locus is present in a disease-specific manner in the blood mononuclear cell fraction of patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or leukemia. To increase the sensitivity of detection, a two-step methylation-specific PCR approach was used to analyze the methylation status of the promoter/exon 1 regions of both p14ARF and p16INK4A genes. Our findings indicate that although INK4A/ARF locus methylation is present in mononuclear cells, this event is not disease-specific since normal subjects also display methylated DNA in their mononuclear cells. In 85.1% of the patients and in 89% of the controls, p16INK4A gene was methylated, while the methylation rates for the p14ARF gene was 32.6 and 36.5%, respectively. The presence of methylated CpG sites in DNA in samples from normal subjects was confirmed by bisulfite genomic sequencing. The difference in the methylation rate between p16INK4A and p14ARF genes among the patients was highly significant (p<0.001).

Here we review the identification and characterization of the myeloid leukemia-specific antigens proteinase 3 and neutrophil elastase found in the primary (azurophil) granule proteins of granulocytes and their precursors. A peptide 'PR1' derived from these proteins induces powerful HLA-A0201-restricted CD8 T-cell proliferation. PR1-specific T cells are cytotoxic to leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome progenitors, and occur at low frequencies in normal individuals. Frequencies are higher in patients with myeloid leukemias, and highest in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia entering molecular remission after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: These observations, together with the known association of autoimmunity to proteinase 3 and neutrophil elastase in Wegener's granulomatosis, support the concept that there is a natural immunity to primary granule proteins which can be boosted to enhance immunity to leukemia. Preliminary reports indicate that PR1 peptide vaccination induces significant increases in PR1-specific cytotoxic T cells with rapid and durable remissions in some patients with advanced myeloid leukemias. SUMMARY: These promising developments in antileukemia vaccines have stimulated research to optimize vaccine delivery and modify regulation of natural T-cell immunity to primary granule proteins to improve treatment of otherwise refractory myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Barrett, John', 'Rezvani, Katayoun']","['Barrett J', 'Rezvani K']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. barrettjj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Active/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/pathology', 'Secretory Vesicles/*immunology/metabolism']",77,2005/12/02 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/12/02 09:00'],"['2005/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['00062752-200601000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/01.moh.0000190112.92908.3e [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2006 Jan;13(1):15-20. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000190112.92908.3e.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of C/EBPalpha function in myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo leads to a block to myeloid differentiation similar to that which is observed in malignant cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The finding of C/EBPalpha alterations in subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia patients suggests a direct link between critically decreased C/EBPalpha function and the development of the disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: Conditional mouse models provide direct evidence that loss of C/EBPalpha function leads to the accumulation of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow. Targeted disruption of the wild type C/EBPalpha protein, while conserving the dominant-negative 30 kDa isoform of C/EBPalpha, induces an AML-like disease in mice. In hematopoietic stem cells C/EBPalpha serves to limit cell self-renewal. Finally, C/EBPalpha function is disrupted at different levels in specific subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia patients. SUMMARY: There is evidence that impaired C/EBPalpha function contributes directly to the development of acute myeloid leukemia. Normal myeloid development and acute myeloid leukemia are now thought to reflect opposite sides of the same hematopoietic coin. Restoring C/EBPalpha function represents a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Myelopoiesis']",93,2005/12/02 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/12/02 09:00'],"['2005/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['00062752-200601000-00003 [pii]', '10.1097/01.moh.0000190110.08156.96 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2006 Jan;13(1):7-14. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000190110.08156.96.,,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Neutropenic enterocolitis, also referred to as typhlitis, is a life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy, most often associated with leukemia or lymphoma. Recently, a larger number of reports have been published of individuals presenting with this syndrome after being treated with newer chemotherapeutic agents for solid tumors such as non-small cell lung, ovarian, and peritoneal cancer, as well as following autologous stem cell transplantation. Recent studies have also better characterized computed tomographic and ultrasonographic features of this entity that can help differentiate neutropenic enterocolitis from other gastrointestinal complications. A newly published systematic analysis of the literature, which included 145 articles, defines appropriate diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations.

Mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL that impair drug binding have been identified as the major mechanism of resistance. It is not known when exactly these mutations arise, but in some patients retrospective analysis of pretherapeutic samples demonstrated identical mutations, suggesting selection in the presence of drug. In the present study we have used a highly sensitive PCR assay to screen for kinase domain mutations in pretherapeutic samples from CML patients, irrespective of their subsequent response to imatinib. We find that kinase domain mutations are demonstrable in approximately 1/3 of patients with accelerated phase or blast crisis and that the presence of two copies of the Philadelphia chromosome is strongly correlated with mutation detection. Unexpectedly, kinase domain mutant clones were not invariably selected in the presence of drug, suggesting that additional mechanisms must contribute to a fully drug resistant leukemia.","['Lange, Thoralf', 'Park, Byung', 'Willis, Stephanie G', 'Deininger, Michael W N']","['Lange T', 'Park B', 'Willis SG', 'Deininger MW']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2005/12/02 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2005/12/02 09:00'],"['2005/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['2261 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.12.2261 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Dec;4(12):1761-6. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.12.2261.

Residence and drinking water source histories and data from municipal water supplies were used to estimate individual chlorination disinfection by-product exposure according to water source, chlorination status, and chlorination disinfection by-product levels during the 40-year period before the interview. The analysis included 686 cases and 3,420 controls for whom water quality information was available for at least 30 of these years. Increased risk of chronic myeloid leukemia was associated with increasing years of exposure to different chlorination disinfection by-product indexes, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.72 (95% confidence interval: 1.01, 3.08) for the highest exposure duration to total trihalomethanes of more than 40 microg/liter. In contrast, the risk of the other studied leukemia subtypes was found to decrease with increasing years of exposure to chlorination disinfection by-products. A protective effect was noted for chronic lymphoid leukemia (odds ratio = 0.60, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.41, 0.87) associated with the highest exposure duration to total trihalomethanes of more than 40 microg/liter.

Here, we examine the effects of Sb(III) and pentavalent antimonial drugs (Sb(V)) on glutathione homeostasis, oxidative stress and apoptosis in the human leukaemia monocyte cell line, THP-1. Although growth of THP-1 macrophages is unaffected by Sb(V), macrophages are extremely sensitive to Sb(III). On exposure to Sb(III), intracellular free glutathione (GSH) levels in macrophages decrease linearly by 50% over 4h, associated with efflux of both GSH and accumulation of intracellular glutathione disulphide (GSSG). Together these effects increase the redox potential of the GSSG/GSH couple from -282 to -225mV. Sb(III)-induced GSH efflux from THP-1 macrophages is accompanied by the concomitant efflux of Sb(III) at a constant molar ratio of 3 (GSH) to 1 (Sb(III)), respectively. Sb(III) directly inhibits glutathione reductase activity in macrophages, significantly retarding the regeneration of GSH from GSSG, following diamide oxidation. Sb(III)-treated THP-1 macrophages go on to exhibit elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and show the early signs of apoptosis. The absence of these effects in Sb(V)-treated THP-1 cells suggests that macrophages do not efficiently reduce Sb(V) to Sb(III). Collectively, these findings suggest that Sb(III) seriously compromises thiol homeostasis in THP-1 macrophages and that this may be an early defining event in the mode of action of antimonials against leukaemia cells.","['Wyllie, Susan', 'Fairlamb, Alan H']","['Wyllie S', 'Fairlamb AH']","['Division of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Biology, Wellcome Trust Biocentre, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, DD1 5EH Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antimony Potassium Tartrate/*pharmacology', 'Antimony Sodium Gluconate/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,2005/12/02 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/12/02 09:00'],"['2005/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00715-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.10.043 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Jan 12;71(3):257-67. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.10.043.

He was admitted to our hospital because of the acute development of diplopia and weakness of his left upper extremity accompanying with the exacerbation of other symptoms of cGVHD. Neurological examinations revealed the right abducens nerve palsy and asymmetric muscular weakness of the extremities; the proximal part of the left upper extremity and the distal part of the right upper extremity were markedly involved. Neurophysiological studies including magnetic motor root stimulation revealed demyelinating neuropathy specifically involving the motor nerves. On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy associated with cGVHD was made. Nighteen reports are available on peripheral neuropathy in cGVHD patients, but to date little is known about the pathophysiology of this condition. Most of those patients have been diagnosed as having symmetric demyelinating polyneuropathy, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. In this study, contrary to previous reports, the asymmetric involvement of motor nerves is noteworthy.

The present study assessed the incidence of fractures, osteonecrosis (ON), and bone pain during ALL treatment and compared the fracture incidence with age- and sex-specific reference data from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). PROCEDURE: Medical records of 122 ALL patients diagnosed at our institution from 1992 to 2004 were reviewed for information on fractures, ON, bone pain, and their anatomical location, risk group, phase of antileukemic therapy, and time since diagnosis. Evaluation of skeletal complications was followed up until July 2005 or the patient's death. Thirteen children were excluded as they were transferred to other institutions shortly after diagnosis. RESULTS: Skeletal complications occurred at a 5-year incidence of 32.7%. The 5-year incidence of fractures, ON, and isolated bone pain was 13.5%, 12.1%, and 12.3%, respectively. The relative rate of fractures adjusted for age and sex was 2.03 (95% confidence interval 1.15-3.57) compared to the GPRD, with greatest rates in children <5 years. Thirty ON occurred in 10 patients with a 15 times greater incidence in children >10 years than in those <5 years. Nearly all skeletal complications occurred during maintenance therapy at a median of 14.92 months (range 0.0-53.8) after diagnosis and in weight-bearing bones. CONCLUSIONS: The doubled fracture rate and the high incidence of skeletal complications during the first years after diagnosis suggest the developing skeleton is very vulnerable in this period. Adolescents develop more ON whereas younger children may be more prone to fractures. Serious ""immediate effects"" of chemotherapy on bone appear of great concern and should entail preventative studies in this group of patients.","['Hogler, Wolfgang', 'Wehl, Gotz', 'van Staa, Tjeerd', 'Meister, Bernhard', 'Klein-Franke, Andreas', 'Kropshofer, Gabriele']","['Hogler W', 'Wehl G', 'van Staa T', 'Meister B', 'Klein-Franke A', 'Kropshofer G']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. wolfgang.hoegler@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fractures, Bone/*chemically induced/*mortality/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2005/12/01 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20701 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jan;48(1):21-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20701.,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

METHODS: We identified 11 patients (7 female) who had radiological and clinical features consistent with PRES and were treated for cancer at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between January 1995 and January 2005. Clinical and radiographic data were abstracted from their records. RESULTS: The average age at the time of PRES onset was 10.4 years. Primary diagnoses were acute leukemia (n = 8), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2), and Ewing sarcoma (n = 1). PRES occurred in 8 patients during the induction phase of treatment, and all 11 patients had hypertension (5 chronically). Seizure activity was proximate to cytarabine and tacrolimus administration in three patients and further seizures occurred with re-administration of these medications in two patients. Coagulation and chemistry studies were normal. Concurrent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated T2 signal abnormalities in all 11 patients, restricted diffusion in 4, and hemorrhage in 3. Follow-up MRI showed chronic changes consistent with a previous hemorrhage in three and evidence of prior parenchymal ischemia in one. Three patients developed epilepsy and remain on chronic anticonvulsant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: PRES is an increasingly recognized complication of pediatric cancer treatment. Risk factors for PRES in pediatric cancer patients include hypertension (not necessarily acute), remission induction chemotherapy, and administration of tacrolimus. MR images often show atypical findings, some of which are irreversible. A significant number of patients develop epilepsy despite clinical and radiographic evidence of recovery.","['Morris, E Brannon', 'Laningham, Fred H', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Khan, Raja B']","['Morris EB', 'Laningham FH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Khan RB']","[""Division of Neurology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. brannon.morris@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epilepsy/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/complications', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*complications', 'Seizures/etiology', 'Syndrome']",,2005/12/01 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20703 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Feb;48(2):152-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20703.,['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before the imatinib mesylate era, a prospective phase II trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerance of a combination of interferon-alpha 2b (IFN) and cytarabine in children with CML in first chronic phase without a suitable HLA-identical donor. PROCEDURE: Fourteen consecutive children were recruited from 12 pediatric centers. Children received daily IFN (5 million U/m2) and subcutaneous cytarabine (20 mg/m2) for 10 days every month. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up is 13 months (range 2-32 months). Seven children achieved a complete hematologic response after a median time of treatment of 3 months (range 1 week-4 months). Three children were not evaluable for the cytogenetic response. A major cytogenetic response was achieved in seven patients (including complete cytogenetic response in two patient) within 12 months. The median time to major cytogenetic response was 7 months (range 3-12 months). Thirteen patients discontinued the treatment protocol after a median time of 11 months. Probability of progression free survival at 11 months was 83% (95% CI, 61%-100%). Grade 3 and 4 toxicity was observed in eight patients. The most frequently reported drug-related events were fever, mucositis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

IL-6 can alter gene transcription via Janus kinases (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signal cascade. We examined this cascade in IL-6 regulation of Mcl-1 transcription in human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. STAT3 was constitutively activated (i.e., tyrosine-phosphorylated) in cholangiocarcinoma cells but not in nonmalignant cholangiocytes. Treatment with anti-IL-6 antisera or the JAK inhibitor AG490 or transfection with dominant negative STAT3 diminished Mcl-1 messenger RNA and protein levels. Likewise, these attempts to interrupt the STAT3 cascade also reduced Mcl-1 promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of a putative STAT3 consensus binding sequence decreased Mcl-1 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated a direct binding of STAT3 to the putative STAT3 binding sequences in the Mcl-1 promoter. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by AG490 sensitized the cells to apoptosis mediated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. In conclusion, we have directly demonstrated a STAT3 regulatory element in the Mcl-1 promoter.

Cytotoxicity in vitro was determined against several gemcitabine-sensitive parental and gemcitabine-resistant cancer cell lines using the sulforhodamine B assay. The in vivo toxicity was examined by changes in body weight and hematologic indices of conventional mice. Immunodeficient SCID mice bearing P388 and BxPC-3 tumor xenografts were used to evaluate the in-vivo therapeutic efficacy. Both NEO6002 and gemcitabine showed pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic effects against all gemcitabine-sensitive cell lines tested. Unlike gemcitabine, the cytotoxicity of NEO6002 was independent of nucleoside transporter (NT) inhibitors, indicating a different internalization route of NEO6002. The conjugate demonstrated a favorable activity not only in ARAC-8C, a NT-deficient gemcitabine-resistant human leukemia cell line, but also in several other gemcitabine-resistant cell lines. At the in-vivo level, a comparative toxicity study showed a significant body weight loss and a decrease in white blood cell counts in gemcitabine-treated mice, whereas the influence of NEO6002 was mild. Treatment of NEO6002 at 27 micromol/kg increased the median survival of CD2F1 mice bearing P388 cells by up to 73%, while at the same doses and schedule of gemcitabine resulted in toxic deaths of all treated mice. At a dose of 18 micromol/kg, NEO6002 inhibited the growth of BxPC-3 xenografts by 52%, while only 32% of tumor inhibition was achieved with gemcitabine. We conclude that NEO6002 may be an effective chemotherapeutic agent with improved tolerability and can potentially circumvent NT-deficient, gemcitabine-resistant tumors.","['Chen, Paul', 'Chien, Pei-Yu', 'Khan, Abdul R', 'Sheikh, Saifuddin', 'Ali, Shoukath M', 'Ahmad, Moghis U', 'Ahmad, Imran']","['Chen P', 'Chien PY', 'Khan AR', 'Sheikh S', 'Ali SM', 'Ahmad MU', 'Ahmad I']","['Research and Development, NeoPharm Inc., Waukegan, Illinois 60085, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cardiolipins/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2005/12/01 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200601000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/01.cad.0000185182.80227.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2006 Jan;17(1):53-61. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000185182.80227.48.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (NEO 6002)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",,['Anticancer Drugs. 2006 Feb;17(2):237'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional review of the results of a survey of long-term cancer survivors who had been treated at the authors' institution. RESULTS: Of 3936 respondents to the survey, 168 (4%) reported having had cataracts. Cataracts were most frequent in survivors of hematologic diseases (chronic leukemia, 17%; myeloma, 13%; acute leukemia, 9%; and lymphoma, 7%). There were no notable associations between cataracts and gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, education completed, or work status. Cancer survivors with cataracts were more likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health (56% vs 39%). There was a trend of association between cataracts and prior treatment with bone marrow transplantation, but not corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Cataracts affect a minority of long-term cancer survivors, but those who reported them were more likely to report that cancer had had a lasting effect on their overall health. Vision evaluation for all cancer survivors is recommended.","['Stava, Charles', 'Beck, Martha', 'Vassilopoulou-Sellin, Rena']","['Stava C', 'Beck M', 'Vassilopoulou-Sellin R']","['Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cataract/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Survivors', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,2005/12/01 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['00000421-200512000-00013 [pii]', '10.1097/01.coc.0000175291.51232.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec;28(6):603-8. doi: 10.1097/01.coc.0000175291.51232.48.,,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (C group), injected with 1 ml saline solution, the MEL group (M group) injected with 1 ml MEL (murine erythroleukemia cell line) and the MEL + VP16 group (V group) injected with 1 ml MEL and from the 8th day after injection, 20 microl VP16 (1 microg/microl) was injected intraperitoneally every five days. One week after MEL injection, erythroblastic cells increased in the bone marrow and proerythroblasts were found in the peripheral blood, suggesting that erythroleukemia was induced. Abnormalities were also found in spleens and livers later. At around twenty days after injection, the mice in M group died and about four weeks after injection, the mice in V group also died. Compared with C group, the hemorheological indexes [the deformation index DI, orientation index (DI(or)), and the small deformation index (DI(d))], electrophoretic mobility, membrane fluidity as well as osmotic fragility of red blood cells (RBC) in M and V groups changed significantly. But after VP16 administration, the changes of above parameters in V group were less significant than those of M group.

To investigate this further, we analyzed the VH and VL gene rearrangements in 90 VH3-21+ patients from Sweden, Germany, Italy, United States, Finland, and Australia and correlated these data with survival and other prognostic markers. Sixty-three percent exhibited mutated VH genes and 37% unmutated VH genes. Fifty (56%) patients displayed a short and homologous heavy-chain CDR3, many of these with the amino acid motif DANGMDV. Also, a highly biased Vlambda2-14 use was evident in 72% of patients with a restricted light-chain CDR3, QVWDS(S/G)SDHPWV. Combined restricted heavy- and light-chain CDR3s were found in patients from all included countries. Although VH3-21+ CLLs have a remarkably predominant lambda expression, analyses of kappa deleting element indicated a conserved light-chain rearrangement order. The overall survival was poor in the VH3-21+ cohort (median survival, 88 months), with no significant difference in relation to mutation status or CDR3 homology. High ZAP-70 and CD38 expression was found in both mutated and unmutated VH3-21+ cases as well as a slight increase of 11q-aberrations.

Adequate increases in serum TPO level in response to thrombocytopenia were seen in patients with ALL and with c-mpl-deficient (c-mpl-) AML. In contrast, in patients with c-mpl-proficient (c-mpl+) AML, TPO levels were found to be inappropriately low but increased to expected values during induction chemotherapy as blasts disappeared. In vitro significant TPO-associated blast cell proliferation or decreased apoptosis was observed only in patients with c-mpl+ AML compared with ALL or c-mpl- AML and was highly correlated with low in vivo TPO levels (P < .001). These data suggest that, in patients with AML, inadequate TPO levels are secondary to TPO clearing by functional c-mpl receptor myeloid blast cells and that TPO may serve as an in vivo myeloid leukemic growth factor in a significant number of patients.","['Corazza, Francis', 'Hermans, Christophe', ""D'Hondt, Stephanie"", 'Ferster, Alina', 'Kentos, Alain', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Sariban, Eric']","['Corazza F', 'Hermans C', ""D'Hondt S"", 'Ferster A', 'Kentos A', 'Benoit Y', 'Sariban E']","['Laboratory of Hematology, CHU-Brugmann, 4 Place Van Gehuchten, B-1020 Brussels, Belgium. francis.corazza@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/blood/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Growth Substances/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",,2005/12/01 09:00,2006/06/01 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65703-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2552 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Mar 15;107(6):2525-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2552.

We have investigated the effect of LIF on gametes in vitro, on the hypothesis that the ovulatory peak of LIF can exert an influence on gametes present within the oviduct. We also investigated the effect of LIF on in vitro fertilization and embryo development, in oocytes from adult sheep and from prepubertal lambs that lack the preovulatory hormone surge and that are unable to sustain early embryonic development. A higher rate of pronuclear-stage embryos derived from both, adult and prepubertal female, was obtained when in vitro fertilization was performed in the presence of LIF, and there was an improved cleavage of parthenogenetic embryos when incubated with LIF immediately following activation. In contrast, LIF was found to have no influence on the viability of ram semen. In vitro fertilized two-cell stage embryos from adult sheep and prepubertal lambs, cultured in defined medium enriched with LIF, both reached the blastocyst stage at similar rates to control embryos. However, LIF exerted a positive influence on the quality of the blastocysts as revealed by significantly higher number of ICM cells and total number of cells.

The analysis of membrane integrity and morphological modifications by flow cytometry in the presence of these two compounds indicated that treated cells undergo necrosis, while 1 and 2 trigger apoptosis.

More than 80% of newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase attain a complete cytogenetic response (CCR). Although remissions in patients with early disease are generally durable, acquired resistance after an initial response is common in advanced disease. Reactivation of Bcr-Abl signaling is almost invariably present at the time of relapse, consistent with re-establishment of the initial pathogenetic mechanism. Mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of Bcr-Abl that impair drug binding and increased expression of Bcr-Abl have been identified as major mechanism of acquired drug resistance. The fact that Bcr-Abl remains central to disease pathogenesis at the time of relapse implies that it also remains the optimal drug target. Alternative Abl kinase inhibitors with increased potency and activity against most Bcr-Abl KD mutants are currently undergoing phase I/II clinical testing, with encouraging early results. Despite the high rates of CCR, persistence of residual leukemia as assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the rule even in patients with chronic phase, suggesting that even these patients may remain at risk of relapse. Understanding the mechanisms underlying disease persistence will be crucial for developing strategies to eradicate residual leukemia.","['Deininger, Michael']",['Deininger M'],"['OHSU Cancer Institute, Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Portland, OR 97239, USA. deininge@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",75,2005/12/01 09:00,2006/02/07 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.6004/jnccn.2005.0045 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2005 Nov;3(6):757-68. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2005.0045.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we first investigated the effect of highly purified C-PC on growth and proliferation of HeLa cells in vitro. The results indicated that there was a significant decrease in the number of cells that survived for HeLa cells treated with C-PC compared with control cells untreated with C-PC. Further electron-microscopic studies revealed that C-PC could induce characteristic apoptotic features, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, microvilli loss, chromatin margination and condensation into dense granules or blocks. Agarose electrophoresis of genomic DNA of HeLa cells treated with C-PC showed fragmentation pattern (DNA ladder of oligomers of 180-200 bp) typical for apoptotic cells. Flow-cytometric analysis of HeLa cells treated with different concentrations of C-PC demonstrated an increasing percentage of cells in sub-G0/G1 phase. In addition, we found that C-PC could promote the expression of Fas and ICAM-1 (intercellular cell-adhesion molecule 1) protein, while it held back the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphocytic-leukaemia proto-oncogene 2) protein expression. This suggested that C-PC could induce the activation of pro-apoptotic gene and downregulation of anti-apoptotic gene expression and then facilitate the transduction of tumoural apoptosis signals that resulted in the apoptosis of HeLa cells in vitro. Caspases 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10 were activated in C-PC-treated HeLa cells, which suggested that C-PC-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent. C-PC treatment of HeLa cells also resulted in release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol that was related to apoptosis of C-PC-treated HeLa cells.","['Li, Bing', 'Gao, Mei-Hua', 'Zhang, Xue-Cheng', 'Chu, Xian-Ming']","['Li B', 'Gao MH', 'Zhang XC', 'Chu XM']","[""College of Marine Life Sciences, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyanobacteria/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Phycocyanin/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",,2005/12/01 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['BA20050142 [pii]', '10.1042/BA20050142 [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 2006 Mar;43(Pt 3):155-64. doi: 10.1042/BA20050142.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '11016-15-2 (Phycocyanin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally developed to capture the best qualities of cladribine and fludarabine, clofarabine contains halogenated carbons, rendering it resistant to inactivating enzymes and maintaining its stability in acidic environments. Like other adenosine nucleosides, clofarabine acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA replication and also resulting in premature DNA chain termination. Clofarabine has also been shown to induce apoptosis in transformed cell lines, indicating that clofarabine results in cell death in both cycling and non-cycling cells. Interest in the development of clofarabine was initially hampered by the availability of other active nucleoside analogues for the treatment of haematological malignancies. However, the results of several early-phase trials evaluating the use of clofarabine in acute leukaemias in adults and children have rekindled enthusiasm for further investigation into its use. This article describes the development, pharmacology, toxicity and clinical activity of clofarabine, as well as discuss its potential role in the treatment of acute leukaemia.","['Kline, Justin P', 'Larson, Richard A']","['Kline JP', 'Larson RA']","['Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. jkline@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clofarabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology/metabolism']",31,2005/12/01 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2005/12/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14656566.6.15.2711 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2005 Dec;6(15):2711-8. doi: 10.1517/14656566.6.15.2711.,,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then the small pieces would develop into blastocyte-like structures (BLS), which could be facilitated by an addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the primary culture and their diameter was nearly doubled from 12 to 24 h. The additional yolk had no positive effect on the development in the first 12 h but encouraged the BLSs attaching and inner cells differentiating instead in 24 h. The inner cells of the BLS showing a high alkaline-phosphatase activity similar to those in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and also expressing a large amount of the specific stage embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) on the surface, which was known to be the characteristic of non-differentiated mouse and avian ES cells, could finally differentiate into nerve-like cells, fibroblast cells and so on in the medium.

The V(H)1-69 gene was the first to be reported overrepresented in a large number of CLL patients, where the V(H)1-69(+) CLL rearrangements showed characteristic molecular features, such as unmutated V(H) genes, usage of specific diversity/joining gene segments, and a longer than average complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 with certain common amino acid motifs. Also, biased usage of the V(H)3-07 and V(H)4-34 genes with specific rearrangement characteristics was reported in CLL. These findings led to the speculation that antigens could be involved during CLL development by triggering proliferation of B-cells with specific B-cell receptors (BCRs) leading to an increased risk of transforming events. Recently, we characterized a subset of CLL utilizing the V(H)3-21 gene that also displayed peculiar Ig features, e.g. very short and homologous CDR3s, predominant lambda expression and preferential V(lambda)2-14 gene usage. This V(H)3-21(+) subgroup also had poor prognosis despite the fact that two-thirds of cases carried mutated V(H) genes. Moreover, we and others have thereafter described further CLL subsets with very similar heavy and light chain gene rearrangement features. These latter findings of subsets expressing restricted BCRs have emphasized the hypothesis that antigens could play a role during the pathogenesis of CLL. Interestingly, recombinant antibodies produced from these restricted subsets showed similar cytoplasmatic reactivity within each group, thus suggesting recognition of a limited number of autoantigens. Further characterization of antigens is now necessary in order to understand their nature and exact role in CLL development.","['Tobin, Gerard', 'Rosen, Anders', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Tobin G', 'Rosen A', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Sweden. richar.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",66,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.760 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2006 Mar;24(1):7-13. doi: 10.1002/hon.760.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

We analyzed the potential inactivation of the CIP/KIP family of the cyclin E/CDK/RB pathway by gene promoter hypermethylation in leukemias. The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) with primers for methylated (M-MSP) and unmethylated (U-MSP) alleles of the p21, p27, and p57 genes was used to study five leukemic cell lines, 50 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, and 25 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples. p21 was hemizygously methylated in Raji and Jurkat but remained unmethylated in U937, HL60, and NB4. p27 was hemizygously methylated in Raji but unmethylated in the other cell lines. p57 was completely methylated in Raji and NB4, hemizygously methylated in U937, and unmethylated in HL60 and Jurkat. At diagnosis, p21 methylation was not detected in any case of AML or ALL. p27 methylation occurred in 2 (4%) AML patients and in 1 (4%) ALL patient. p57 methylation occurred in 1 (2%) AML patient and in 1 (4%) ALL patient. Therefore, methylation inactivation of the INK4/CDK/RB pathway in leukemia is infrequent. A review of the literature showed a marked variation in the frequencies of methylation of these genes, which might be attributable to difference in methodologies used to detect gene methylation.","['Chim, C S', 'Wong, A S Y', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Chim CS', 'Wong AS', 'Kwong YL']","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Alleles', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20503 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Dec;80(4):282-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20503.,,"['0 (CIB1 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed 46 cases with confirmed LPD-associated PML published from 1958 to 2004. Patients were stratified according to two different time periods: group A included patients diagnosed before 1989, and group B included patients diagnosed since 1990, after introduction of purine analogues. Group A patients (n = 22) had received alkylating agents and/or radiotherapy, and the majority (63.6%) had advanced Hodgkin disease. At univariate analysis, uncontrolled Hodgkin disease was the only risk factor for PML. In group B patients (n = 24), the most frequent treatments received were purine analogues (58.3%) and high-dose therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (33.3%; HDT/HSCT). B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (45.8%) and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (24.9%) were the most frequent underlying LPDs. Patients treated with purine analogues were more likely to have active LPD, lower CD4 cell counts, and to be older and male than were HSCT recipients. The median interval from purine analogues or HDT/HSCT to PML was 11 months. In HDT/HSCT recipients, this interval was delayed for 10 months when peri-transplantation rituximab was used. Univariate analysis identified age >55 years, male sex, and CD4 cell counts <or=0.2 x 10(9)/L as risk factors for PML in patients treated with purine analogues. Mortality rates were 95.4% (group A patients), 90% (purine analogues), and 62.5% (HDT/HSCT recipients). At univariate analysis, the only factor that significantly correlated with recovery from infection was female sex. Our findings indicate (1) the possible reduction in reported cases associated with Hodgkin disease and the increasing number of published cases associated with the new antineoplastic therapies (purine analogues and HDT/HSCT); (2) among patients treated with purine analogues, PML is more common in male patients with CD4 cell counts <or=0.2 x 10(9)/L; (3) the use of rituximab after HDT/HSCT seems to delay the onset of PML; and (4) the prognosis is slightly better in transplant recipients.","['Garcia-Suarez, Julio', 'de Miguel, Dunia', 'Krsnik, Isabel', 'Banas, Helena', 'Arribas, Ignacio', 'Burgaleta, Carmen']","['Garcia-Suarez J', 'de Miguel D', 'Krsnik I', 'Banas H', 'Arribas I', 'Burgaleta C']","['Service of Hematology, Principe de Asturias University Hospital, Department of Medicine, University of Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain. jgarciasu.hupa@salud.madrid.org']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Combined Modality Therapy/history/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*HIV', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/complications/history/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/history/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Purines/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy/history/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab', 'Sex Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/history/methods']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20492 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Dec;80(4):271-81. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20492.,,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Abnormal ASPP1 expression was associated with normal function of the tumor-suppressor gene TP53 in ALL. The analyses of 180 patients with ALL at diagnosis showed that the ASPP1 promoter was hypermethylated in 25% of cases with decreased mRNA expression. Methylation was significantly higher in adult ALL vs childhood ALL (32 vs 17%, P = 0.03) and T-ALL vs B-ALL (50 vs 9%, P = 0.001).

The expression of thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2) is lost during the transition of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines. Here, we analysed the mechanism of loss of TBP-2 expression and the role of TBP-2 in IL-2-dependent growth in the in vitro model to investigate multistep transformation of HTLV-I. CpGs in the TBP-2 gene are methylated in IL-2-independent but not in IL-2-dependent cells. Sequential treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and a histone deacetylase inhibitor augmented histone acetylation and TBP-2 expression, suggesting that loss of TBP-2 expression is due to DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. In IL-2-dependent cells, a basal level of TBP-2 expression was maintained by IL-2 associated with cellular growth, whereas TBP-2 expression was upregulated on deprivation of IL-2 associated with growth suppression. Overexpression of TBP-2 in IL-2-independent cells suppressed the growth and partially restored responsiveness to IL-2. Knockdown of TBP-2 caused the IL-2-dependent cells to show partial growth without IL-2. These results suggested that epigenetic silencing of the TBP-2 gene results in a loss of responsiveness to IL-2, contributing to uncontrolled IL-2-independent growth in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines.","['Ahsan, M K', 'Masutani, H', 'Yamaguchi, Y', 'Kim, Y-C', 'Nosaka, K', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Nishinaka, Y', 'Maeda, M', 'Yodoi, J']","['Ahsan MK', 'Masutani H', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Kim YC', 'Nosaka K', 'Matsuoka M', 'Nishinaka Y', 'Maeda M', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Shogoin, Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Thioredoxins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vorinostat']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/05/10 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209256 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209256 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Apr 6;25(15):2181-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209256.,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that the ability of Sf-Stk to participate in the transformation of Friend virus-infected cells requires the kinase activity and Grb2-binding site of Sf-Stk. Here we show that Grb2 heterozygous mice exhibit decreased susceptibility to Friend erythroleukemia and that expansion of erythroid progenitors in response to infection requires the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. A fusion protein in which the Grb2-binding site in Sf-Stk is replaced by Gab2, supports the growth of progenitors from mice lacking Sf-Stk, whereas a Sf-Stk/Gab1 fusion protein does not. Gab2 is expressed in spleens from Friend virus-infected mice, co-immunoprecipitates with Sf-Stk and is tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of Sf-Stk. Mice with a targeted deletion in Gab2 are less susceptible to Friend erythroleukemia and the expansion of erythroid progenitor cells in response to infection can be rescued by expression of Gab2, but not Gab1. Taken together, these data indicate that a Sf-Stk/Grb2/Gab2 complex mediates the growth of primary erythroid progenitor cells in response to Friend virus.","['Teal, H E', 'Ni, S', 'Xu, J', 'Finkelstein, L D', 'Cheng, A M', 'Paulson, R F', 'Feng, G-S', 'Correll, P H']","['Teal HE', 'Ni S', 'Xu J', 'Finkelstein LD', 'Cheng AM', 'Paulson RF', 'Feng GS', 'Correll PH']","['Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Science, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802-3500, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'src Homology Domains']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209288 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209288 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Apr 20;25(17):2433-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209288.,"['R01 HL066471/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL66208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-L66471/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Gab1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RON protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the increased use of UCB in stem cell transplantation, the mechanisms underlying these favorable outcomes are not well delineated. METHODS: We analyzed antigen specific lymphocyte responses after transplant to determine whether the decreased allogeneic responsiveness of UCB lymphocytes is attributable to pan-unresponsiveness, lymphocyte repressive or recipient-specific tolerance. RESULTS: Circulating lymphocytes collected early (3 months) after UCB transplant demonstrate a less naive phenotype compared with that in the infused graft. Additionally, after transplant, circulating peripheral blood UCB-derived lymphocytes produced normal levels of interferon-gamma and proliferated normally when stimulated with mitogen or third party alloantigen. In contrast, when stimulated with recipient antigen, circulating lymphocytes emerging posttransplant did not proliferate nor produce interferon-gamma. Moreover, analysis of interleukin-4 production revealed a Th2 response to recipient antigens. These data indicate early induction of immune tolerance of naive UCB graft lymphocytes with skewing of transplant recipient-specific immune response towards Th2 cytokine profile. CONCLUSIONS: UCB graft lymphocyte immune naivety and observed early tolerance induction may contribute to the observed favorable GVHD incidence, despite infusion of HLA mismatch grafts in the unrelated allogeneic setting.","['Kleen, Thomas O', 'Kadereit, Suzanne', 'Fanning, Laura R', 'Jaroscak, Jennifer', 'Fu, Pingfu', 'Meyerson, Howard J', 'Kulchycki, Lara', 'Slivka, Laura F', 'Kozik, Margaret', 'Tary-Lehmann, Magdalena', 'Laughlin, Mary J']","['Kleen TO', 'Kadereit S', 'Fanning LR', 'Jaroscak J', 'Fu P', 'Meyerson HJ', 'Kulchycki L', 'Slivka LF', 'Kozik M', 'Tary-Lehmann M', 'Laughlin MJ']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-7284, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*immunology', '*Fetal Blood', 'HLA Antigens/blood', 'Humans', 'Interferons/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Transplantation Tolerance']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['00007890-200511150-00025 [pii]', '10.1097/01.tp.0000188172.26531.6f [doi]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2005 Nov 15;80(9):1316-22. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000188172.26531.6f.,"['R01-AI47289-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI47756/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (HLA Antigens)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NAT plays an initial role in the metabolism of these arylamine compounds. 2-Aminofluorene is one of the arylamine carcinogens which have been demonstrated to undergo N-acetylation in laboratory animals and humans. Our previous study showed that human cancer cell lines (colon cancer, colo 205; liver cancer, Hep G2; bladder cancer, T24; leukemia, HL-60; prostate cancer, LNCaP; osteogenic sarcoma, U-2 OS; malignant melanoma, A375.S2) displayed NAT activity, which was affected by aloe-emodin in human leukemia cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether aloe-emodin could affect the enzyme activity and gene expression of NAT at the mRNA and protein levels in malignant human melanoma A375.S2 cells. The results showed that aloe-emodin inhibited NAT1 activity (decreased N-acetylation of 2-aminofluorene) in intact cells in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of aloe-emodin on NAT1 at the protein level was determined by Western blotting and the mRNA levels were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cDNA microarray.

This has increased the proportion of patients with myeloid malignancies eligible for allogeneic transplantation. However, the capacity of RIC allografts to produce durable remissions in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) has not yet been defined, and consequently, the role of RIC allografts in the management of these diseases remains conjectural. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with high-risk AML or MDS received an allograft using a fludarabine/melphalan RIC regimen incorporating alemtuzumab. The median age of the cohort was 52 years (range, 18 to 71 years). RESULTS: The 100-day transplantation-related mortality rate was 9%, and no patient developed greater than grade 2 graft-versus-host disease. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 13 to 70 months), 27 patients were alive and in remission, with 3-year actuarial overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 41% and 37%, respectively. The 3-year OS and DFS rates of patients with AML in complete remission at the time of transplantation were 48% and 42%, respectively. Disease relapse was the most common cause of treatment failure and occurred at a median time of 6 months after transplantation. All but one patient destined to relapse did so within 24 months of transplantation. CONCLUSION: The extended follow-up in this series identifies a high risk of early disease relapse but provides evidence that RIC allografts can produce sustained DFS in a significant number of patients with AML who would be ineligible for allogeneic transplantation with myeloablative conditioning.","['Tauro, Sudhir', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Peggs, Karl', 'Begum, Gulnaz', 'Mahendra, Premini', 'Cook, Gordon', 'Marsh, Judith', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Goldstone, Anthony', 'Hunter, Ann', 'Khwaja, Asim', 'Chopra, Raj', 'Littlewood, Timothy', 'Peniket, Andrew', 'Parker, Anne', 'Jackson, Graham', 'Hale, Geoff', 'Cook, Mark', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Mackinnon, Stephen']","['Tauro S', 'Craddock C', 'Peggs K', 'Begum G', 'Mahendra P', 'Cook G', 'Marsh J', 'Milligan D', 'Goldstone A', 'Hunter A', 'Khwaja A', 'Chopra R', 'Littlewood T', 'Peniket A', 'Parker A', 'Jackson G', 'Hale G', 'Cook M', 'Russell N', 'Mackinnon S']","['Department of Hematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.02.0057 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.0057 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec 20;23(36):9387-93. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.0057.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred seven patients with advanced HL (stage III to IV, or earlier stage with systemic symptoms or bulky disease) were randomly assigned between ABVD and MDR specified before randomization as alternating chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisolone (ChlVPP) with prednisolone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and etoposide (PABIOE), or hybrid ChlVPP/etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin (EVA). Radiotherapy was planned for incomplete response or initial bulk disease. RESULTS: At 52 months median follow-up, 212 event-free survival (EFS) events (disease progression or any death) were reported. In the primary comparison, at 3 years EFS was 75% (95% CI, 71% to 79%) for ABVD and 75% (95% CI, 70% to 79%) for MDRs (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.37; HR more than 1.0 favors ABVD). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 90% (95% CI, 87% to 93%) in patients allocated ABVD and 88% (95% CI, 84% to 91%) in patients allocated MDRs (HR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.77). Patients receiving MDRs experienced more grade 3/4 infection, mucositis, and neuropathy. One occurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome was reported, but no acute leukemia was reported. When the two MDRs are compared separately with ABVD, neither the alternating nor the hybrid regimen showed a statistically significant difference from ABVD for EFS or OS. Subgroup analysis suggested that MDRs may be associated with poorer outcomes in older patients (heterogeneity test of OS older or younger than 45 years, P = .020). CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of significant difference in EFS or OS between ABVD and MDRs in the trial overall or if the two MDR versus ABVD comparisons are considered separately. ABVD remains the standard for treatment of advanced HL.","['Johnson, Peter W M', 'Radford, John A', 'Cullen, Michael H', 'Sydes, Matthew R', 'Walewski, Jan', 'Jack, Andrew S', 'MacLennan, Kenneth A', 'Stenning, Sally P', 'Clawson, Simon', 'Smith, Paul', 'Ryder, David', 'Hancock, Barry W']","['Johnson PW', 'Radford JA', 'Cullen MH', 'Sydes MR', 'Walewski J', 'Jack AS', 'MacLennan KA', 'Stenning SP', 'Clawson S', 'Smith P', 'Ryder D', 'Hancock BW']","['Cancer Research UK Clinical Centre, Somers Cancer Research Building, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom. johnsonp@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.03.2151 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.2151 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec 20;23(36):9208-18. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.2151.

Recent studies have revealed that septins are involved in not only diverse normal cellular processes but also the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer. SEPT6 is ubiquitously expressed in tissues and one of the fusion partner genes of MLL in the 11q23 translocations implicated in acute leukemia. However, the roles of this septin in vivo remain elusive. We have developed Sept6-deficient mice that exhibited neither gross abnormalities, changes in cytokinesis, nor spontaneous malignancy. Sept6 deficiency did not cause any quantitative changes in any of the septins evaluated in this study, nor did it cause any additional changes in the Sept4-deficient mice. Even the depletion of Sept11, a close homolog of Sept6, did not affect the Sept6-null cells in vitro, thus implying a high degree of redundancy in the septin system. Furthermore, a loss of Sept6 did not alter the phenotype of myeloproliferative disease induced by MLL-SEPT6, thus suggesting that Sept6 does not function as a tumor suppressor. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that a disruption of the translocation partner gene of MLL in 11q23 translocation does not contribute to leukemogenesis by the MLL fusion gene.","['Ono, Ryoichi', 'Ihara, Masafumi', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Ozaki, Katsutoshi', 'Kataoka-Fujiwara, Yuki', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Nagata, Koh-Ichi', 'Inagaki, Masaki', 'Yoshida, Nobuaki', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Kinoshita, Makoto', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya']","['Ono R', 'Ihara M', 'Nakajima H', 'Ozaki K', 'Kataoka-Fujiwara Y', 'Taki T', 'Nagata K', 'Inagaki M', 'Yoshida N', 'Kitamura T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Kinoshita M', 'Nosaka T']","['Division of Hematopoietic Factors, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/deficiency/genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Septins', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/24/10965 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.24.10965-10978.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Dec;25(24):10965-78. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.24.10965-10978.2005.,,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (MLL-SEPT6 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Sept4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Sept6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",,,PMC1316963,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of cultured embryonic subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells with LIF generates GFAP(+) cells that have a bipolar/tripolar morphology, remain in cell cycle, contain progenitor cell markers and demonstrate self-renewal with enhanced neurogenesis - characteristics that are typical of adult SVZ and subgranular zone (SGZ) stem cells/astrocytes. By contrast, BMP-induced GFAP(+) cells are stellate, exit the cell cycle, and lack progenitor traits and self-renewal--characteristics that are typical of astrocytes in the non-neurogenic adult cortex. In vivo, transgenic overexpression of BMP4 increases the number of GFAP(+) astrocytes but depletes the GFAP(+) progenitor cell pool, whereas transgenic inhibition of BMP signaling increases the size of the GFAP(+) progenitor cell pool but reduces the overall numbers of astrocytes.

Although the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated myositis is primarily unknown, a direct effect of cytokines or viral proteins in myocytotoxicity is suspected. We have developed an in vitro cell culture model to study the interactions between primary human muscle cells and HTLV-1 chronically infected cells. When HTLV-1-infected cell lines were added to differentiated muscle cultures, cytopathic changes such as fiber shrinking were observed as early as 1 day after contact. This was accompanied by alterations in desmin and vimentin organization, occurring in the absence of muscle cell infection but with Tax-1 present in myotubes. Cytopathic changes were also observed when infected culture supernatants were added to the muscle cells. Fiber atrophy and cytoskeletal disorganization were confirmed in muscle biopsies from two HTLV-1-infected patients with myositis. Transduction of cultured muscle cells with a lentiviral vector containing the HTLV-1 Tax gene reproduced such effects in vitro. The present data indicate that the myocytotoxicity that is observed in HTLV-1-associated myopathies can be due to a direct effect of the Tax-1 protein expressed in infected inflammatory cells, in the absence of muscle cell infection.","['Ozden, Simona', 'Mouly, Vincent', 'Prevost, Marie-Christine', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Butler-Browne, Gillian', 'Ceccaldi, Pierre-Emmanuel']","['Ozden S', 'Mouly V', 'Prevost MC', 'Gessain A', 'Butler-Browne G', 'Ceccaldi PE']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement Ecosystemes et Epidemiologie des Maladies Infectieuses, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inflammation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/pathology/virology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*pathology/ultrastructure/virology', 'Myositis/virology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Wasting Syndrome/*virology']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/03/09 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)61245-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61245-X [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2005 Dec;167(6):1609-19. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61245-X.,,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TAX1BP1 protein, human)']",,,PMC1613204,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because B chronic lymphoid leukemia (B-CLL) cells exhibit a defective apoptotic response, we analyzed CD19(+) B lymphocytes purified from the peripheral blood of B-CLL patients. Microarray analysis showed a variable (up to 38-fold) increase in the steady-state mRNA levels of COX-2 in B-CLL lymphocytes compared with normal CD19(+) B lymphocytes. The up-regulation of COX-2 in B-CLL cells was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis of B-CLL bone marrow infiltrates confirmed clear expression of COX-2 in leukemic cells. Ex vivo treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 significantly decreased the survival of leukemic cells by increasing the rate of spontaneous apoptosis in 13 of 16 B-CLL samples examined, but it did not affect the survival of normal lymphocytes. Pretreatment with NS-398 significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity induced by chlorambucil in 8 of 16 B-CLL samples examined. Moreover, although recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)/Apo2L showed little cytotoxic effect in most B-CLL samples examined, pretreatment with NS-398 sensitized 8 of 16 B-CLL samples to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate that COX-2 overexpression likely represents an additional mechanism of resistance to apoptosis in B-CLL and that pharmacological suppression of COX-2 might enhance chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis.","['Secchiero, Paola', 'Barbarotto, Elisa', 'Gonelli, Arianna', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Zerbinati, Carlotta', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Pileri, Stefano A', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Secchiero P', 'Barbarotto E', 'Gonelli A', 'Tiribelli M', 'Zerbinati C', 'Celeghini C', 'Agostinelli C', 'Pileri SA', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, University of Ferrara, Italy. secchier@mail.umbi.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/03/09 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)61244-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61244-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2005 Dec;167(6):1599-607. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61244-8.,,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)']",,,PMC1613188,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurements by 3D microscopy were compared to results obtained after standard FISH using commercially available abl/bcr BAC probes. The relative radial fluorescence distributions in lymphocyte cell nuclei of healthy donors in comparison to cell nuclei of blood cells of CML patients showed a strong correlation in the location of abl and bcr for both labelling techniques. The absolute distances of the homologous bcr domains and the abl domain-nuclear center-abl domain angles in cell nuclei of CML donors differed significantly from those of healthy donors only when COMBO-FISH was applied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects in this prospective study comprised 10 children with ALL (mean age, 6 years; range, 0-16 years). In addition to conventional MRI, magnetization transfer images were obtained before and after intrathecal and intravenous MTX therapy. MTR values were calculated and plotted as a histogram, and peak height and location were calculated. Differences in peak height and location between pre- and post-MTX therapy scans were statistically analyzed. Conventional MRI was evaluated for abnormal signal area in white matter. RESULTS: MTR peak height was significantly lower on post-MTX therapy scans than on pre-MTX therapy scans (p = 0.002). No significant differences in peak location were identified between pre- and post-chemotherapy imaging. No abnormal signals were noted in white matter on either pre- or post-MTX therapy conventional MRI.

The mechanism by which EVI1 operates in the transformation of hematopoietic cells is not known, but it is clear that EVI1 upregulates cell proliferation, impairs cell differentiation, and induces cell transformation. In this review, we summarize the biochemical properties of EVI1 and the effects of EVI1 in biological models.","['Nucifora, Giuseppina', 'Laricchia-Robbio, Leopoldo', 'Senyuk, Vitalyi']","['Nucifora G', 'Laricchia-Robbio L', 'Senyuk V']","['Department of Pathology, University of Illinois at Chicago, 60607, United States. nucifora@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/history/physiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*metabolism/pathology', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phylogeny', '*Proto-Oncogenes/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors/history/physiology']",71,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(05)00593-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2005.09.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2006 Mar 1;368:1-11. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2005.09.020.

METHODS: Bone marrow was extracted from the anterior superior iliac spines of 21 patients with CML. MSCs were isolated and cultured. Single colony derived MSCs were harvested by limiting dilution. The cell cycle and immunophenotype of the expanded clonal MSCs were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Different agents were used to induce the MSCs to differentiate into osteocyte, adipocyte and neural cells. Von Kossa staining, oil-red staining, and Western blotting was used to examine the ability of differentiation. PCR was used to detect the expression of BCR/ABL gene. The ultrastructure of the CML derived MSCs was observed with electron microscopy. Sixteen BALB/c nude mice were randomly divided into 2 equal groups to be inoculated with HL60 cancer cells and CML derived MSCs to observe the tumorigenicity. MSCs were cultured in soft agar for 2 weeks to observe the clone growth. RESULTS: Fibroblast-like, positive in CD29, CD44, and CD105, and negative in CD116, CD34, CD48, and HLA-DR, the CML derived MSCs could differentiate into osteocyte, adipocyte and neural cells. CML derived MSCs showed normal karyotype and ultrastructure, they did not express BCR/ABL gene. After 2 weeks' culture no clone was formed from the MSCs. Four weeks after tumors were shown in 6 of the 8 mice inoculated with HL60 cells, and no tumor was seen in the mice inoculated with MSCs. CONCLUSION: Able to differentiate into different types of cell and without tumorigenicity, MSCs from the bone marrow of CML patients have the potentiality in clinical application.","['Zhao, Zhi-gang', 'Tang, Xiao-qiong', 'Li, Jing', 'Shi, Ming-xia', 'Zou, Ping']","['Zhao ZG', 'Tang XQ', 'Li J', 'Shi MX', 'Zou P']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/surgery', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Random Allocation']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2007/05/30 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Aug 3;85(29):2054-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In several studies, rasburicase, given at a dose of 0.15-0.2 mg/kg for up to 7 d, proved to be highly effective in lowering urate levels. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) who experienced tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with acute renal failure after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and after bendamustine treatment. During the first episode of TLS, after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (creatinine 3.3 mg/dL, urate 24.6 mg/dL), the patient received rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg for 3 d. Urate levels decreased below the lower limit of normal and renal function recovered. After bendamustine therapy, given for disease progression 8 months later, TLS with acute oliguric renal failure re-occurred (creatinine 3.1 mg/dL, urate 20.8 mg/dL). The patient was treated with hyperhydration and two doses of rasburicase (0.056 mg/kg), resulting in a prompt decrease of the urate level and recovery of renal function. Both episodes of TLS were successfully treated with rasburicase in a lower dose than recommended by the manufacturer. During a second bendamustine course, TLS was successfully treated by low doses of rasburicase (0.056 mg/kg for 2 d). CONCLUSION: This is the first report of TLS in CLL after bendamustine chemotherapy reported in the literature. Treatment and prevention of TLS by low doses of rasburicase is possible and cost-effective.","['Hummel, Margit', 'Buchheidt, Dieter', 'Reiter, Sebastian', 'Bergmann, Jorg', 'Adam, Katja', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger']","['Hummel M', 'Buchheidt D', 'Reiter S', 'Bergmann J', 'Adam K', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

The level of CEC in peripheral blood (PB) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients has not been investigated prior to this study. We evaluated the count of resting (rCEC), activated (aCEC) and endothelial progenitor cells (CEPC) in the PB of AML and healthy subjects. In addition we correlated the levels of CEC with disease status, known prognostic factors and response to treatment. METHODS: CEC were quantified by utilizing four-color flow cytometry procedures in 48 AML patients at the time of diagnosis and 29 healthy controls. Additionally, measurements were again taken after the first course of induction treatment in 12 of the patients. RESULTS: The numbers of aCEC, rCEC and CEPC were significantly higher in the AML patients than in the controls (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The CEC count was significantly higher in the AML patients with white blood cell count (WBC) >15 G/L, elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and a higher (over median) absolute blasts count (ABC) in PB than in the group with WBC <15 G/L (P < 0.03), a normal LDH level (P < 0.03) and a lower (<median) ABC (P < 0.05). The levels of aCEC, rCEC and CEPC determined after the first course of chemotherapy were significantly lower than at diagnosis in the patients who achieved complete remission (P < 0.02), and do not differ in patients refractory to treatment. CONCLUSION: CEC levels are higher in AML and correlate with disease status and response to treatment. Further investigation should be undertaken to better determine their prognostic value.","['Wierzbowska, Agnieszka', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Krawczynska, Anna', 'Wrzesien-Kus, Agata', 'Pluta, Agnieszka', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Wierzbowska A', 'Robak T', 'Krawczynska A', 'Wrzesien-Kus A', 'Pluta A', 'Cebula B', 'Smolewski P']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Endothelial Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydro-Lyases/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*blood/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Remission Induction']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH549 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00549.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Dec;75(6):492-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00549.x.,,"['EC 4.2.1.- (Hydro-Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.1.54 (lactate dehydratase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced bone marrow (BM) angiogenesis is regarded as an essential cofactor in the progression of MDS to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and microvessel formation may be induced by TNF-alpha as well. To investigate TNF-alpha signaling and neoangiogenesis as potential molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention in MDS with respect to the various MDS subtypes, we performed a morphological and clinico-pathological study on a large series of paraffin-embedded trephine BM biopsies. METHODS: TNF-alpha expression and BM vessels were immunohistochemically analyzed on 89 paraffin-embedded BM biopsies from patients with MDS and secondary AML, including 12 control samples. Data were correlated with clinico-pathological and laboratory parameters and analyzed for their prognostic significance considering overall survival. RESULTS: TNF-alpha was over-expressed in MDS patients, especially in those with refractory anemia and its expression correlated with BM cellularity and with magnitude of anemia as well as with microvessel density (MVD). TNF-alpha over-expression was associated with premature deaths. MVD was increased in MDS and secondary AML and correlated with marrow cellularity and expression of TNF-alpha, but was not of prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha expression and MVD are elevated in MDS and secondary AML. TNF-alpha expression in BM progenitor cells appears to negatively impact erythropoiesis and overall survival in MDS, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in patients with hypercellular MDS with marked anemia.","['Stifter, Gerald', 'Heiss, Simone', 'Gastl, Gunther', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Stauder, Reinhard']","['Stifter G', 'Heiss S', 'Gastl G', 'Tzankov A', 'Stauder R']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH551 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00551.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Dec;75(6):485-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00551.x.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is evidence to suggest, that those receptors could have a role in leukemia. We have studied the expression of PRR molecules PRR1 and PRR2 on mononuclear bone marrow (BM) cells of 55 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at first diagnosis by FACS-analysis using directly Phycoerythrin-labeled markers (PRR1 clone R1.302.12; PRR2 clone R2.477.1) in combination with other Fluorescein conjugated antibodies to evaluate the blast phenotype in AML. The leukemic gate included blasts and residual monocytes and lymphocytes. A case was defined as positive, if more than 20% of the gated cells expressed the regarding receptor. We could demonstrate, that on average 35% PRR1(+) or 45% PRR2(+) cells in AML were found. Within FAB-types we observed a high PRR1 expression in cases with M3 and M4 and lowest expressions in M0 and M5; a high PRR2 expression was found in cases with M3, M4, M5 and M1 and lowest expressions in M0 and M2. Separating our patients' cohorts in cytogenetic risk groups we could detect a significant higher proportion of PRR1(+) cases (73% vs. 25% of cases, P = 0.009) or PRR1(+) cells (57% vs. 18% of cases, P = 0.001) in the cytogenetic favorable risk vs. poor risk group (75% vs. 32% PRR2(+) cases). Moreover cut-off-values with a maximum probability for a significant differentiation between cases with higher or lower levels of these markers could be found: cases with >78% PRR1(+) and cases with >77% PRR2(+) cells were characterized by a tendency for longer relapse free survival times. Qui-square analyses showed, that 3 of 4 cases with FAB-type M3 (P = 0.03) or a favorable karyotype (P = 0.04) were found in the group with >7% PRR1(+) cells, due to only few cases available a similar correlation, however, could not be found in cases with >78% PRR2(+) cells. We can conclude, that blasts in AML regularly express PRR1 and PRR2. Cases with a high expression of PRR1 or PRR2 are characterized by a more favorable prognosis. With respect to the individual PRR-status the benefit of biological response modifiers as priming agents, differentiation mediators or factors influencing cellular metabolisms inducing factors can be discussed under a new point of view.","['Graf, M', 'Reif, S', 'Hecht, K', 'Kroell, T', 'Nuessler, V', 'Schmetzer, H']","['Graf M', 'Reif S', 'Hecht K', 'Kroell T', 'Nuessler V', 'Schmetzer H']","['Medical Department 3, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', '*Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Nectins', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH539 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00539.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Dec;75(6):477-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00539.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nectins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the possible involvement of CD4(+)CD25(high) T-reg in the immune impairment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The frequencies and phenotypes of CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells in the peripheral blood of AML patients were determined by flow cytometry. To assess the functional activity of CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells, CD4(+)CD25(high), and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells were sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with FACS Vantage. The immunoregulatory properties of CD4(+)CD25(high) and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells were characterized by proliferation assays and cytokine production assays. In addition, the frequency of apoptotic and proliferating cells in CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells were respectively evaluated by 7AAD and ki67 binding cells using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, AML patients had a higher proportion of CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells in peripheral blood. These cells were CD45-RA(-), CD69(-), CD45-RO(+), CD95(+), and intercellular CTLA-4(+), and secreted low levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10, but no IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma. They inhibited the proliferation and cytokine production (IL-2, IFN-gamma) of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, but improved IL-10 production under the co-culture of both subsets with stimulation, thus behaving as T-reg. Notably, CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells in AML patients presented significantly higher apoptosis and proliferation than that of healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CD4(+)CD25(high) T-reg in peripheral blood in AML patients is significantly higher when compared with healthy individuals, likely due to the increasing proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells.","['Wang, Xingbing', 'Zheng, Jine', 'Liu, Jun', 'Yao, Junxia', 'He, Yanli', 'Li, Xiaoqing', 'Yu, Jingming', 'Yang, Jing', 'Liu, Zhongping', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Wang X', 'Zheng J', 'Liu J', 'Yao J', 'He Y', 'Li X', 'Yu J', 'Yang J', 'Liu Z', 'Huang S']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count/methods', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/blood/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood/*immunology']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH537 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00537.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Dec;75(6):468-76. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00537.x.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The literature dealing with AL-related electrolyte abnormalities and their interactions in leukemic patients was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE. The search strategy was based on the combination of 'acute leukemia', 'electrolyte abnormalities', 'acid-base disorders', 'potassium', 'sodium', 'magnesium', 'calcium', and 'phosphorus'. References of retrieved articles were also screened. A decrease in serum potassium, mainly owing to lysozyme-induced tubular damage, appears to be one of the most frequent and potentially hazardous abnormalities. Other clinically significant metabolic perturbations include hyponatremia and hypercalcemia. CONCLUSION: A broad spectrum of electrolyte abnormalities is encountered in the clinical setting of AL, which are related to the disease process per se and/or to the therapeutic interventions. Clinicians should be vigilant for early detection and appropriate management of these disorders before the initiation of chemotherapy regimens as well as during treatment.","['Filippatos, Theodosios D', 'Milionis, Haralampos J', 'Elisaf, Moses S']","['Filippatos TD', 'Milionis HJ', 'Elisaf MS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['*Acid-Base Imbalance/etiology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/metabolism', 'MEDLINE', '*Water-Electrolyte Imbalance/etiology/metabolism']",128,2005/11/30 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH547 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00547.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Dec;75(6):449-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00547.x.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we have comparatively evaluated the concentrations of the anticancer agent daunorubicin (DNR) in intracellular compartments of drug-sensitive and MDR HL-60 cell lines, both of which do not express common efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein at the plasma membrane. Our results suggest that lysosomal sequestration plays a significant role in the emergence of MDR since it effectively limits the drug's ability to interact with target molecules located in the nucleus. Using a series of weakly basic structural isomers with variable basicity, we illustrate that the magnitude of the pKa value correlates with the degree of lysosomal sequestration. Accordingly, a series of structurally modified forms of DNR with reduced basicity were synthesized, and their intracellular distribution was evaluated. Consistent with model compounds, derivatives of DNR with lowered pKa values showed visibly reduced lysosomal sequestration in two separate MDR cell lines. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of understanding the intracellular localization of drugs and proposes a rational strategy to manipulate it.","['Duvvuri, Muralikrishna', 'Konkar, Samidha', 'Funk, Ryan S', 'Krise, Joanna M', 'Krise, Jeffrey P']","['Duvvuri M', 'Konkar S', 'Funk RS', 'Krise JM', 'Krise JP']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas 66047, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Cell Compartmentation/physiology', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi051759w [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2005 Dec 6;44(48):15743-9. doi: 10.1021/bi051759w.,['CA106655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-four children with acute leukemia in complete remission stage were divided into two groups. Twenty patients in the Astragalus (90 g daily) group were treated with large dose of Astragalus (90 g daily) based on conventional chemotherapy for one month, while 24 patients in the control group received chemotherapy alone. MNC were extracted from peripheral blood by wall-sticking method and cultured with such cell factors as interleukin-4, gramulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 7-8 days. Phenotype of DC was assayed by flow cytometry and antigen presenting ability of them was assayed by mixed lymphocyte reaction. RESULTS: There was no morphological difference in MNC induced DC between the two groups. The average number of DC in Astragalus group and control group was 4.4 x 10(6) / 2.5 x 10(6) MNC and 2.6 x 10(6) / 2.5 x 10(6) MNC, respectively, showing significant difference (P < 0.001). DC in Astragalus group could stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes strongly, showing significant difference when compared with that in the control group (P < 0.001). Conclusion Large dose of Astragalus could increase the DC induction of MNC and enhance the antigen presenting ability of DC in acute leukemia patients.","['Dong, Jing', 'Gu, Hua-li', 'Ma, Cheng-tai', 'Zhang, Furong', 'Chen, Zhihong', 'Zhang, Yuanchao']","['Dong J', 'Gu HL', 'Ma CT', 'Zhang F', 'Chen Z', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Rheumatology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan. dongjing218@tom.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology', 'Astragalus propinquus/*chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;25(10):872-5.,,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The study subjects were 45,394 people that had died of cancers in 2002, were registered by the Korea Central Cancer Registry and received National Health Insurance benefit in the last year (360 days) of life. Personal identification data, general characteristics, dates of death and cancer incidence, and site of cancer were collected from the National Statistical Office and the Korea Central Cancer Registry, and merged with the data of the individual medical expenses of the Health Insurance Review Agency. RESULTS: Average monthly cost curves were U-shaped with high costs near the time of diagnosis and death, and lower costs in between. Medical expenses in the last year of life were around 30.3, 16.7, 13.0, and 12.1 million won among leukemia, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer patients, respectively. Digestive organ cancers including stomach, esophagus, liver, pancreas, and colorectal cancers had relatively low medical expenses. Medical expenses in the last year of life were inverse Ushaped with high expenses near one year of survival. Average monthly cost in the 12 months before death among the patients who had survived 10-15 years were more than two-fold greater than the cost before diagnosis among those who had survived for less than one year. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemia was the most expensive cancer. It is possible that once diagnosed as cancer, medical expenses do not return to the level before diagnosis. Further research will be needed to understand the magnitude and change of the medical expenses among cancer patients with long term follow up data.","['Yi, Jee-Jeon', 'Yoo, Won-Kon', 'Kim, So-Yoon', 'Kim, Kwang-Ki', 'Yi, Sang-Wook']","['Yi JJ', 'Yoo WK', 'Kim SY', 'Kim KK', 'Yi SW']","['Graduate School of Public Health, Yonsei University. flyhigh@kwandong.ac.kr']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),J Prev Med Public Health,Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,101242972,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Korea', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*economics/physiopathology', '*Survival']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Prev Med Public Health. 2005 Feb;38(1):9-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Milk, serum, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-blood samples were collected from 524 adult Holstein cows originating from 6 dairy herds in Central Argentina. The M108 and S108 were compared with agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), polymerase chain reaction and a commercial ELISA. Because there is currently no reference test capable of serving as a gold standard, the test sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) were evaluated by the use of a latent class model. Statistical inference was performed by classical maximum likelihood and by Bayesian techniques. The maximum-likelihood analysis was performed assuming conditional independence of tests, whereas the Bayesian approach allowed for conditional dependence. No clear conclusion could be drawn about conditional dependence of tests. Results with maximum likelihood (under conditional independence) and posterior Bayes (under conditional dependence) were practically the same. Conservative estimates of SE and SP (with 95% confidence intervals) for M108 were 98.6 (96.7; 99.6) and 96.7 (92.9; 98.8) and for S108 99.5 (98.2; 99.9) and 95.4 (90.9; 98.1), respectively. The ELISA 108 using either milk or serum to detect BLV-infected animals had comparable SE and SP with the official AGID and a commercial ELISA test, which are currently the most widely accepted tests for the serological diagnosis of BLV infection. Therefore, ELISA 108 can be used as an alternative test in monitoring and control programs.","['Monti, Gustavo E', 'Frankena, Klaas', 'Engel, Bas', 'Buist, Willem', 'Tarabla, Hector D', 'de Jong, Mart C M']","['Monti GE', 'Frankena K', 'Engel B', 'Buist W', 'Tarabla HD', 'de Jong MC']","['Universidad Austral de Chile, Instituto de Medicina Preventiva, Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, Valdiva, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",9011490,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Blocking', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Argentina', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Immunodiffusion/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Milk/microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2005/11/30 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/11/30 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/104063870501700507 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Diagn Invest. 2005 Sep;17(5):451-7. doi: 10.1177/104063870501700507.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies of up to seven HCL patients, many of the 22 established T-cell receptor (TCR) beta variable region (TRBV) families showed mono- or oligoclonal restriction. To determine whether percentages of CTLs are correlated with TRBV clonal excess, we studied 20 HCL patients with flow cytometry, PCR of TCR gamma and TRBV regions, and fractional gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified TRBV CDR3 domains (CDR3 spectratyping). Increased percentages of CD3+/CD8+/CD57+ CTLs correlated with more mono/oligoclonal and fewer polyclonal TRBV families (r=0.53; P=0.016). Age correlated with number of mono/oligoclonal TRBV families (r=0.51; P=0.022). Time since last purine analog therapy correlated with number of polyclonal TRBV families (r=0.46; P=0.040), but treatment with the anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22 was not related to clonal excess. We conclude that abnormalities in the T-cell repertoire in HCL patients may represent deficient immunity, and may be exacerbated by purine analogs. Increased CD3+/CD57+ T-cells may be a useful marker of abnormal TRBV repertoire in HCL patients, and might prove useful in deciding whether patients should receive biologic antibody-based treatment rather than repeated courses of purine analog for relapsed disease.","['Arons, Evgeny', 'Sorbara, Lynn', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Liewehr, David J', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Kreitman, Robert J']","['Arons E', 'Sorbara L', 'Raffeld M', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Steinberg SM', 'Liewehr DJ', 'Pastan I', 'Kreitman RJ']","['Laboratories of Molecular Biology and Pathology, and Biostatistics and Data Management Section, Centers for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Enterotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*classification/drug effects']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2006/08/22 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-005-0099-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Sep;55(9):1100-10. doi: 10.1007/s00262-005-0099-1.

We previously reported that mice with a deletion of an upstream regulatory element (URE) of the gene encoding PU.1 (Sfpi1) developed acute myeloid leukemia. Here we show that the URE has an essential role in orchestrating the dynamic PU.1 expression pattern required for lymphoid development and tumor suppression. URE deletion ablated B2 cells but stimulated growth of B1 cells in mice. The URE was a PU.1 enhancer in B cells but a repressor in T cell precursors. TCF transcription factors coordinated this repressor function and linked PU.1 to Wnt signaling. Failure of appropriate PU.1 repression in T cell progenitors with URE deletion disrupted differentiation and induced thymic transformation. Genome-wide DNA methylation assessment showed that epigenetic silencing of selective tumor suppressor genes completed PU.1-initiated transformation of lymphoid progenitors with URE deletion. These results elucidate how a single transcription factor, PU.1, through the cell context-specific activity of a key cis-regulatory element, affects the development of multiple cell lineages and can induce cancer.","['Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Owens, Bronwyn M', 'Yu, Li', 'Tumang, Joseph R', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Clayton, Linda K', 'Wagner, Katharina', 'Scheller, Marina', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Liu, Chunhui', 'Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Leutz, Achim', 'Rothstein, Thomas L', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Rosenbauer F', 'Owens BM', 'Yu L', 'Tumang JR', 'Steidl U', 'Kutok JL', 'Clayton LK', 'Wagner K', 'Scheller M', 'Iwasaki H', 'Liu C', 'Hackanson B', 'Akashi K', 'Leutz A', 'Rothstein TL', 'Plass C', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Institutes of Medicine and Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. f.rosenbauer@mdc-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'TCF Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Thy-1 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/growth & development/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['ng1679 [pii]', '10.1038/ng1679 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2006 Jan;38(1):27-37. doi: 10.1038/ng1679.

To further understand the mechanism of action of this compound, we have identified its specific targets by microarray studies. We report on the global expression profiles of genes expressed at 3 days upon LIF withdrawal (d3) compared to pluripotent cells and of genes whose expression is modulated at d3 under anti-apoptotic conditions. We showed that at d3 without LIF cells express, earlier than anticipated, specialized cell markers and that when the apoptotic process was impaired, expression of differentiation markers was altered.

The purpose of the study was to characterize the long-term effects of ET on male germ cells using sperm fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. METHODS: Chromosomal aberrations (partial duplications and deletions) and whole chromosomal aneuploidies were detected in sperm of mice treated with a clinical dose of ET. Semen samples were collected at 25 and 49 days after dosing to investigate the effects of ET on meiotic pachytene cells and spermatogonial stem-cells, respectively. RESULTS: ET treatment resulted in major increases in the frequencies of sperm-carrying chromosomal aberrations in both meiotic pachytene (27- to 578-fold) and spermatogonial stem-cells (8- to 16-fold), but aneuploid sperm were induced only after treatment of meiotic cells (27-fold) with no persistent effects in stem cells. CONCLUSION: These results show that ET may have long-lasting effects on the frequencies of sperm with structural aberrations. This has important implications for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with ET because they may remain at higher risk for abnormal reproductive outcomes long after the end of chemotherapy.","['Marchetti, Francesco', 'Pearson, Francesca S', 'Bishop, Jack B', 'Wyrobek, Andrew J']","['Marchetti F', 'Pearson FS', 'Bishop JB', 'Wyrobek AJ']","['Biosciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94550, USA. marchetti2@llnl.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mice', 'Spermatocytes/*drug effects', 'Spermatogonia/*drug effects', 'Stem Cells/drug effects']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2006/06/06 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['dei416 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/dei416 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2006 Apr;21(4):888-95. doi: 10.1093/humrep/dei416.

DESIGN: Institutional, retrospective study. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibody against BCL10 on two tissue microarray blocks that were constructed with paraffin-embedded tissues from the same cohort of 48 patients with ocular adnexal lymphomas. The main outcomes that were measured include extraorbital involvement, recurrence rate, and time to recurrence. The median length of the follow-up period was 40 months. RESULTS: Aberrant BCL10 expression (nuclear [moderate intensity] and cytoplasmic [weak to moderate intensity] staining) was observed in 10 of 33 cases (30.3%) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, in 4 of 10 cases (40%) of follicular lymphoma (grade 1, 9 cases; grade 2, 1 case), in 0 of 2 cases of diffused large B-cell lymphoma, in 0 of 1 case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and in 1 of 1 case (100%) of mantle cell lymphoma. There were no differences in clinical parameters at examination (ie, average age, gender, site of occurrence, laterality, extraorbital involvement at diagnosis), recurrence rate, and time to recurrence for patients (MALT lymphoma or follicular lymphoma) with or without aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression. CONCLUSION: Aberrant BCL10 expression can occur in other types of ocular adnexal lymphomas besides MALT lymphoma. Ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma may have slightly lower frequency of aberrant BCL10 expression than gastric/pulmonary MALT lymphomas that have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, aberrant BCL10 nuclear expression in ocular adnexal lymphoma does not seem to correlate with clinical outcome. Further studies that include a larger number of cases and longer follow-up period are needed to confirm our observation.","['Vejabhuti, Choladda', 'Harris, Gerald J', 'Erickson, Beth A', 'Nishino, Ha', 'Chevez-Barrios, Patricia', 'Chang, Chung-Che']","['Vejabhuti C', 'Harris GJ', 'Erickson BA', 'Nishino H', 'Chevez-Barrios P', 'Chang CC']","['Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Eye Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lacrimal Apparatus Diseases/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9394(05)00617-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajo.2005.05.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 2005 Nov;140(5):836-843. doi: 10.1016/j.ajo.2005.05.038.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Noncomparative, retrospective, interventional case series. METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive patients (84 eyes) underwent pars plana vitrectomy for diagnostic purposes. Vitrectomy with cytologic, cytofluorographic, or microbiologic analysis of vitreous samples was performed. The main outcome measures were the efficiency of diagnostic procedure and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). RESULTS: There were 28 patients (33 eyes) with suspected intraocular lymphoma and 50 patients (51 eyes) with suspected infection, which was subdivided into chronic endogenous endophthalmitis, atypical chorioretinitis, or chronic postoperative inflammation. Vitreous testing led to a diagnosis in 48 of 78 patients (61.5%); 14 patients with a final diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia, and 34 patients with a final diagnosis of infection. When preoperative indication was compared with final clinical diagnosis, the efficiency of the diagnostic procedure of cytologic evaluation, flow cytometry, and bacterial/fungal culture was 67%, 79%, and 96%, respectively. For lymphoma, the PPV of cytologic evaluation was 100% and the NPV 60.9%. For infection, the PPV of bacterial/fungal culture was 100% and the NPV 94.9%. CD22+ B lymphocytes >or=20% of total cells on cytofluorographic analysis had a PPV of 88% for lymphoma. A cytofluorographic CD4:CD8 T-lymphocyte ratio >or=4 had a PPV of 70% for immunologically mediated uveitis. Surgical complications were rare and manageable. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic vitrectomy in selected patients with carefully planned testing is an effective means of supporting diagnoses in intraocular lymphoma, chronic intraocular infections, and atypical chorioretinitis. Flow cytometry quantitates the percentages and ratios of various cell types and is helpful in contrasting intraocular lymphoma with immunologically mediated uveitis.","['Davis, Janet L', 'Miller, Daniel M', 'Ruiz, Phillip']","['Davis JL', 'Miller DM', 'Ruiz P']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida 33136, USA. jdavis@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Bacteriological Techniques', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological', 'Endophthalmitis/diagnosis/microbiology', 'Eye Infections, Bacterial/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Eye Infections, Fungal/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Eye Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Vitrectomy', 'Vitreous Body/*microbiology/*pathology']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9394(05)00611-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajo.2005.05.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 2005 Nov;140(5):822-829. doi: 10.1016/j.ajo.2005.05.032.,,,['Am J Ophthalmol. 2006 May;141(5):982; author reply 982-3.

In a luminol enhanced chemilumimetric assay the responsiveness of differentiated HL-60 cells is tested towards Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The results show a poor sensitivity to S. typhimurium but displays good sensitivity towards B. subtilis, LTA and LPS. Furthermore, the sensitivity towards the yeasts C. albicans and S. cerevisiae is considerably better than obtained in other in vitro cell systems. Overall these results indicate that the HL-60 cell assay possibly could be evolved to a supplementary assay for the known pyrogenic detection assays. Furthermore, the utilization of the assay for pyrogenic examination of recombinant drugs derived from yeast expression systems would be relevant to examine.","['Timm, Michael', 'Hansen, Erik W', 'Moesby, Lise', 'Christensen, Jens D']","['Timm M', 'Hansen EW', 'Moesby L', 'Christensen JD']","['Department of Pharmacology, The Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universitetsparken 2, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,IM,"['Bacillus subtilis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Biological Assay/*methods', 'Candida albicans/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Contamination', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Luminescence', 'Luminol', 'Pyrogens/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Teichoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0928-0987(05)00307-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2005.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2006 Feb;27(2-3):252-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2005.10.006.

Such free-floating spheres have been hypothesized to contain undifferentiated multipotent progenitor cells. Our goal was to isolate and characterize such free-floating spheres from HTM cell primary cultures. For this purpose, HTM cells were incubated in serum-free media and on a nonadhesive substrate. Individual free-floating spheres generated in these conditions were isolated in 96-well plates, and their proliferative capacity was evaluated by monitoring their size increase over time. The expression of the TM markers, MGP and CHI3L1, was examined using recombinant adenoviruses containing the respective promoters. Morphology of the free-floating spheres was analysed in semithin sections, and the gene expression profile was obtained using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix microarrays. HTM cells incubated in serum-free media and on nonadhesive substrate generated free-floating spheres that could be grown for more than 3 months. Addition of serum to the culture media promoted the attachment of the spheres to the substrate, migration of cells from the spheres, and differentiation into cells phenotypically similar to normal TM cells. Gene profiling analysis demonstrated strong similarities between the gene expression profiles of the spheres and HTM cell monolayers. Both infection with the recombinant adenoviruses and gene array analysis demonstrated the expression of CHI3L1 and MGP, indicating that free-floating spheres likely originate from HTM cells. Gene array analysis also showed expression of the marker for neural precursor cells nestin, as well as leukemia inhibitory factor, a gene involved in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of progenitor cells. Analysis of semithin sections indicated that these TM free-floating spheres were highly dynamic structures demonstrating a distinct radial gradient of cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Extensive up- and down-regulation of gene expression was associated with the processes of sphere attachment and cell migration after the addition of serum. These results suggest that HTM primary cultures might contain relatively undifferentiated or progenitor cells. The availability of TM progenitor cell cultures could constitute a useful tool to investigate cell therapy approaches targeting the TM in glaucoma.","['Gonzalez, P', 'Epstein, D L', 'Luna, C', 'Liton, P B']","['Gonzalez P', 'Epstein DL', 'Luna C', 'Liton PB']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University, Erwin Road, Box 3802, Durham NC 27710, USA. pedro.gonzalez@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Eye Res,Experimental eye research,0370707,IM,"['Adipokines', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics', 'Eye Proteins/analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Growth Substances/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/analysis', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/analysis', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis', 'Nestin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Trabecular Meshwork/*cytology']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2006/08/05 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4835(05)00334-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exer.2005.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Eye Res. 2006 Jun;82(6):959-67. doi: 10.1016/j.exer.2005.10.006.

It serves as an antiinflammatory agent and nutrient for normal colon cells. Butyric acid has also been shown to induce apoptosis in colon and many other cancer cells. Artemisinin is a compound extracted from the wormwood Artemisia annua L. It has been shown to selectively kill cancer cells in vitro and to be effective in treating animal and human cancer. We and others have found that the artemisinin analog, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), kills cancer cells by apoptosis. In the present study, the efficacy of a combined treatment of DHA and butyric acid at low doses in killing cancer cells was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molt-4 cells (a human lymphoblastoid leukemia cell line) and freshly isolated human lymphocytes, cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium, were first incubated with 12 microM of human holotransferrin at 37 degrees C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 for one hour to enhance the iron concentration in the cells. Cells from each cell type were then divided into 20 flasks. These flasks were grouped into four sets of five cultures each. Zero, 5, 10 or 20 microM of DHA was added, respectively, to these sets and the cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for one hour. Zero, 1, 5, 10, or 20 mM of sodium butyrate was then added to the five cultures of each set, respectively. Thus, the treatments involved a combination of 4 doses of DHA and 5 doses of sodium butyrate. The cells were counted immediately before the addition of DHA, and at 24 and 48 hours after the addition of sodium butyrate. RESULTS: DHA alone at the 24-hour time-point and 20 microM concentration significantly reduced the number of Molt-4 cells in the culture by approximately 40% (p < 0.001, compared to non-treated control), whereas it did not significantly affect the number of normal human lymphocytes. Similarly, 1 mM sodium butyrate alone at 24 hours reduced the number of Molt-4 cells by approximately 32% (p < 0.001, compared to non-treated control), without significantly affecting normal human lymphocytes. The combination of 20 microM DHA and 1 mM sodium butyrate killed all Molt-4 cells at the 24-hour time-point and did not significantly affect lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: DHA in combination with butyric acid acts synergistically at low doses. The combination may provide a less toxic, inexpensive and effective cancer chemotherapy.","['Singh, Narendra P', 'Lai, Henry C']","['Singh NP', 'Lai HC']","['Department of Bioengineering, Box 357962, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7962, USA.

Only a few reports are available about the effects of retinoids on B lymphoma cells. In our study, non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells (HT58) were treated with ATRA and 4HPR. Both agents induced cell death time- and dose-dependently. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was elevated in 4HPR-treated cells, but not in ATRA-treated cells. The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane occured earlier after ATRA than after 4HPR treament. Z-VAD-fmk, the general caspase inhibitor, decreased the DNA fragmentation in ATRA-treated cells, but simultaneously increased necrosis. However, z-VAD-fmk did not influence the DNA fragmentation in 4HPR-treated cells. Endonuclease G was released from the mitochondria during 4HPR treatment, which could be an inducer for caspase-independent DNA fragmentation.

These data suggest that codeinone has possible antitumor potential, in addition to its action as a narcotic analgesic, even though it induces incomplete apoptosis-associated characteristics.","['Takeuchi, Risa', 'Hoshijima, Hiroshi', 'Onuki, Noriko', 'Nagasaka, Hiroshi', 'Chowdhury, Shahead Ali', 'Kawase, Masami', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi']","['Takeuchi R', 'Hoshijima H', 'Onuki N', 'Nagasaka H', 'Chowdhury SA', 'Kawase M', 'Sakagami H']","['Division of Anesthesiology, Department of Comprehensive Medical Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan. rtakeuch@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Codeine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Nov-Dec;25(6B):4037-41.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '22B5AW0ANN (6-codeinone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'UX6OWY2V7J (Codeine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity of curcumin and a-diisoeugenol against human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells) and human submandibular cancer cells (HSG cells) was similar (CC50 1-3 microM). However, curcumin induced much more apoptosis, particularly in HL-60 cells compared with HSG cells, as revealed by measurement of the sub-G1/G0 DNA fraction in flow cytometric histograms. Treatment with 15 microM curcumin increased the number of cells with a sub-G1/G0 DNA fraction from control levels of <5% to 55% in HL-60 cells and 30% in HSG cells. Flow cytometry, after staining with annexin V-FITC/PI (the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of apoptotic cells), showed a dose-dependent induction of early apoptosis by curcumin, which reached about 65% in HL-60 cells and about 20% in HSG cells after treatment with 10 microM curcumin. In contrast, alpha-diisoeugenol failed to induce apoptosis in either cell type. For both cell types, the proportion of late apoptotic/necrotic cells increased rapidly at concentrations of curcumin and a-diisoeugenol greater than 10 microM. The generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in curcumin-treated HL-60 cells was greater than that in HSG cells, as judged by CDFH-DA staining. In both cell types, ROS generation by a-diisoeugenol was at control levels. ROS generation by curcumin was suppressed by antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) and by scavengers of hydroxy radicals such as mannitol, but, conversely, was promoted by prooxidants such as the transition metal ions Cu(II) and Zn(II). ROS generation may play a part in the exposure of PS. Curcumin, but not a-diisoeugenol, at 10 microM inhibited LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced COX-2 gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Semiempirical PM 3 calculations suggested that this activity of curcumin, in which it behaves as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-like compound, is dependent on its phenolic function, which is more pronounced than that of alpha-diisoeugenol. Taken together, our results suggest that the bioactivity of curcumin is a result of its ability to act as both a prooxidant and an antioxidant.","['Atsumi, Toshiko', 'Murakami, Yukio', 'Shibuya, Kazutoshi', 'Tonosaki, Keiichi', 'Fujisawa, Seiichiro']","['Atsumi T', 'Murakami Y', 'Shibuya K', 'Tonosaki K', 'Fujisawa S']","['Department of Human Development and Fostering, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Eugenol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/drug effects/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Submandibular Gland Neoplasms/drug therapy']",,2005/11/29 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/11/29 09:00'],"['2005/11/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Nov-Dec;25(6B):4029-36.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '3T8H1794QW (Eugenol)', '522-09-8 (diisoeugenol)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the currently largest series of patients treated with caspofungin outside clinical trials. METHODS: Centres in Germany that were known to treat patients with invasive fungal infections were asked to fill out detailed questionnaires for all patients treated with caspofungin. No effort was made to influence the decision to use caspofungin. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were evaluable (median age 48 years, interquartile range 38-58), out of which 41 (35%) suffered from acute leukaemia, 31 (26%) had allogeneic stem cell transplants, 16 (14%) lymphoma or myeloma, 8 (7%) autologous stem cell transplants and 22 (19%) other causes for immunosuppression. One hundred and six patients were evaluable for efficacy out of which 68 (64%) patients achieved a complete or partial remission. A total of 81 out of 115 (70%) patients were alive 30 days after the end of caspofungin therapy. Response rates were similar in proven (20/32, 63%) and probable (27/46, 59%) infections, in neutropenic patients (41/55, 75%) and in patients who were (44/70, 63%) or were not (24/36, 67%) refractory to antifungal pre-treatment. The response rate in mechanically ventilated patients was 29% (7/24). Caspofungin was well tolerated, even in 14 patients, who were concomitantly treated with ciclosporin A, no drug-related elevations of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase or creatinine were found.

Some recent studies exhibit associations in the opposite direction. METHODS: We reviewed journal literature through August 2002 for associations between childhood leukaemia and socioeconomic measures. We determined the direction of each association and its P-value. We described the results with regard to study design, calendar period, geographic locale, and level of the socioeconomic measures (individual or ecological). For measures with sufficient number of results, we computed summary P-values across studies. RESULTS: Case-control studies conducted in North America since 1980 have involved subject interviews or self-administered questionnaires and have consistently reported inverse (negative) associations of childhood leukaemia with individual-level measures of family income, mother's education, and father's education. In contrast, associations have been consistently positive with father's occupational class in record-based case-control studies and with average occupational class in ecological studies. CONCLUSIONS: Connections of SES measures to childhood leukaemia are likely to vary with place and time. Validation studies are needed to estimate SES-related selection and participation in case-control studies. Because different socioeconomic measures (such as income and education) and individual-level and ecological-level measures may represent different risk factors, we advise researchers to report these measures separately rather than in summary indices of social class.","['Poole, Charles', 'Greenland, Sander', 'Luetters, Crystal', 'Kelsey, Jennifer L', 'Mezei, Gabor']","['Poole C', 'Greenland S', 'Luetters C', 'Kelsey JL', 'Mezei G']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina School of Public Health, Chapel Hill, 27599-7435, USA. cpoole@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'Humans', 'Income/statistics & numerical data', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Class']",142,2005/11/26 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2005/11/26 09:00'],"['2005/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyi248 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyi248 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2006 Apr;35(2):370-84. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyi248.

Although the leukemogenic mechanism of HTLV-1 is not fully understood yet, the viral Tax protein is widely regarded as a key factor in this mechanism. Tax can modulate the synthesis or function of many regulatory factors which control a wide range of normal and oncogenic cellular processes and therefore, it acts as a potent oncoprotein. In the last few years, special attention has been attracted to Tax interference with the transactivation function of p53, a tumor-suppressor protein that is involved in regulation of the cell-cycle and apoptosis and in maintaining the cellular genome integrity. p53 is mutated in approximately 60% of all human tumors. In contrast, mutant p53 is found in only small percentage of ATL patients. Nevertheless, p53 is inactive in the leukemic cells of most ATL patients and in most HTLV-1 transformed cells. By inactivating p53, Tax can immortalize the HTLV-1-infected cells and destabilize their genome. Consequently, such cells can progress toward the ultimate leukemic state by a stepwise accumulation of oncogenic mutations and other types of chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, since p53 exists in most ATL patients in its wild-type form, its reactivation by therapeutic drugs might be an effective approach for ATL therapy. Several mechanisms have been proposed so far for Tax-induced p53 inactivation. Understanding the exact mechanism of this Tax effect is essential for designing effective means for this therapeutic approach. In this review article, we discuss the various mechanisms proposed for Tax interference with p53 functions and their clinical and therapeutic implications.","['Tabakin-Fix, Yulia', 'Azran, Inbal', 'Schavinky-Khrapunsky, Yana', 'Levy, Oren', 'Aboud, Mordechai']","['Tabakin-Fix Y', 'Azran I', 'Schavinky-Khrapunsky Y', 'Levy O', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cancer Research Center, Faculty of Health Sciences and Department of Life Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/physiology']",155,2005/11/26 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2005/11/26 09:00'],"['2005/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgi274 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgi274 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2006 Apr;27(4):673-81. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgi274.

We found that increased levels of PML protein, such as through interferon treatment, were able to suppress Z-mediated PML body dispersion. We also studied the consequences of PML dispersion by Z, by examining p21 transactivation, A20 transactivation, and MHC Class I presentation levels in Z-expressing cells. We found that, while Z-mediated dispersion of PML did not affect MHC Class I presentation, it did alter p21 and A20 expression. In addition, we found that increased levels of PML were able to prevent Z protein binding to mitotic chromosomes. Our work implies that the balance of PML and Z levels in cells may affect how each protein functions.","['Bowling, Brandy L', 'Adamson, Amy L']","['Bowling BL', 'Adamson AL']","['Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27402, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomes/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Luciferases/analysis/genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",,2005/11/26 09:00,2006/09/22 09:00,['2005/11/26 09:00'],"['2005/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-1702(05)00332-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2005.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2006 May;117(2):244-53. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2005.10.018.

Efficient loading of an anti-cancer drug, daunorubicin (DNR), was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Its release was quantified by fluorometry. The results indicated that loading, and subsequent release, could be tuned by factors such as feeding concentrations, temperature, and salt concentrations. The intrinsic mechanism of loading and release was discussed taking into account the interaction between the drugs and the poly(styrene sulfonate)/MF complex existing in the hollow capsules.

Adoptive cellular immunotherapy by transfusion of polyclonal donor lymphocytes is not always effective and is limited by cellular cross-reactivity with normal tissues, leading to development of clinical graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). METHOD: To develop an immunotherapeutic strategy for targeted elimination of residual leukemic blasts, human T cells were gene-modified to express CD19-specific chimeric receptors. RESULTS: Gene-modified T cells specifically lyse CD19-expressing lymphatic blast cells, however, they show a limited proliferative response to stimulation with CD19. Integration of the signal transduction domain of the costimulatory molecule CD28 enhances the proliferative properties of the gene-modified T cells.

For a possible benefit of post transplant treatment with NK cells after haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) we developed a clinical scale procedure for NK cell processing observing Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). METHODS: Allogeneic donor NK cells were selected from 15 unstimulated leukaphereses using two rounds of immunomagnetic T cell depletion, followed by an NK cell enrichment step. CD56 (+)CD3 (-) NK cells were stimulated and expanded in vitro according to GMP. Quality control of NK cell purity, residual T cells and cytotoxic activity was done by multi-coloured flow cytometric analyses. RESULTS: Purification led to an absolute number of 234-1 237 x 10 (6) CD56 (+)CD3 (-) NK cells from leukapheresis harvests with a median purity of 95 % and a 4 to 6(1/2) log depletion of T cells. After two weeks stimulation with IL-2 a five-fold expansion of NK cells with a T cell contamination below 0.1 % was reached. Median cell viability was 95 % after purification and 99 % after expansion.

Survival post SCT is primarily determined by relapse, infections and far less by GvHD or other transplant related mortality. During the immune reconstitution the host is at significant risk for severe viral infections. HAdV infection is especially in children an important complication post SCT, with significant morbidity and mortality despite new antiviral treatment strategies. Although control of infection seems to require T-cells, the characterization of HAdV-specific T-cells post SCT has not been introduced in surveillance and treatment decisions. METHODS: Therefore we evaluated the impact of HAdV-infections on the survival between 1995 and 2004 (n = 63) and studied the occurrence of adenovirus-specific T-cells in children with (n = 9) and without (n = 9) HAdV-infection post allogeneic SCT and in healthy donors (n = 53). After stimulation ex-vivo with HAdV-antigen IFN-gamma secreting T-cells were analyzed by flowcytometry and defined as HAdV-specific T-cells. RESULTS: Until day 180 post SCT the cumulative incidence of all lethal viral infections (HAdV n = 5, cytomegalovirus n = 3, herpes simplex virus n = 1) was 16 % for the whole cohort of patients. Cumulative incidence of HAdV-associated mortality was 8.5 %. Cumulative incidence of all lethal viral infections could be now reduced from 16 % to 8 % in conjunction with new surveillance- and therapeutic-strategies. Children with HAdV-associated mortality all had no specific T-cells, although reconstitution of absolute lymphocyte counts exceeded 300/microl within 30 days post transplant. Patients who cleared HAdV infection had normal frequencies of HAdV-specific T-cells until day 200 post SCT. CONCLUSION: In summary adenovirus specific T-cell reconstitution should be monitored in patients after SCT to limit the use of anti viral chemotherapy and help to identify those patients that would benefit from new therapeutic strategies like adoptive transfer of virus specific T-cells.","['Feuchtinger, T', 'Richard, C', 'Pfeiffer, M', 'Neuhauser, F', 'Lucke, J', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Greil, J', 'Bader, P', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Schlegel, P-G', 'Jahn, G', 'Niethammer, D', 'Lang, P']","['Feuchtinger T', 'Richard C', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Neuhauser F', 'Lucke J', 'Handgretinger R', 'Greil J', 'Bader P', 'Klingebiel T', 'Schlegel PG', 'Jahn G', 'Niethammer D', 'Lang P']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['Adenovirus Infections, Human/*immunology/mortality', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Haploidy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*immunology/mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-872530 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2005 Nov-Dec;217(6):339-44. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-872530.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we compare three different graft manipulation methods in patients with leukemias and lymphomas: positive selection of stem cells with either CD34 (n = 39) or CD133-coated magnetic microbeads (n = 14) and a new strategy which depletes T- and B-cells through the use of CD3- and CD19-coated microbeads (n = 11). Median purity of stem cells was comparable after CD34 (+)-selection and CD133 (+)-selection, whereas stem cells were only slightly enriched after CD3 (+)/CD19 (+)-depletion (97.5 %, 93.4 % and 1.02 %). Indirect depletion of T-cells by positive selection resulted in 1 x 10 (4) (median) residual CD3 (+)-cells/kg (0.7-3 x 10 (4)). Patients with CD3/CD19-depleted grafts received 3.2 x 10 (4) (median) (0.7-16 x 10 (4)) residual T-cells/kg. Those grafts also comprised NK-cells (median number: 86 x 10 (6)/kg), dendritic cells and monocytes/granulocytes. Primary engraftment of the stem cell products was comparable after CD34- and CD133-selection (85 and 72 %). In the CD3/CD19 group, 91 % had a primary engraftment. After reconditioning, all patients (64/64) were finally engrafted. Patients with CD34-selected or CD133-selected grafts had similar incidences of a GvHD II-IV (3 and 7 %), whereas a GvHD was slightly increased in patients receiving CD3/CD19-depleted cells (27 %). Reconstitution of CD3 (+) T-cells was faster in the CD3/CD19 group than in the CD34 or CD133 group. These preliminary results indicate, that CD3/CD19-selected grafts may be advantageous regarding engraftment and immunoreconstitution. Since effector cell with potential antileukemic activity are cotransfused, such grafts may be suited in particular for patients with insufficient remission.","['Lang, P', 'Schumm, M', 'Greil, J', 'Bader, P', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Muller, I', 'Feuchtinger, T', 'Pfeiffer, M', 'Schlegel, P-G', 'Niethammer, D', 'Handgretinger, R']","['Lang P', 'Schumm M', 'Greil J', 'Bader P', 'Klingebiel T', 'Muller I', 'Feuchtinger T', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Schlegel PG', 'Niethammer D', 'Handgretinger R']","[""Children's University Hospital Tubingen, Germany. prlang@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', '*Haploidy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microspheres', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Survival Rate']",,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-872529 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2005 Nov-Dec;217(6):334-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-872529.,,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We measured asparagine (asn) levels in plasma after a single dose of 2,500 IU/m(2) i.v. PEG-ASNase (Oncaspar) in consolidation treatment of ALL and compared those with data from the previous protocol COALL-05-92. This protocol was similar to COALL-06-97, except that children had been given 45,000 IU/m(2) C-ASNase instead of PEG-ASNase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2000 and December 2001 seventy-one children (38 boys, 33 girls) with newly diagnosed ALL treated according to the multicenter protocol COALL-06-97 were investigated in this study. Four hundred and seventy-four plasma samples (71 patients) were analysed by ion exchange chromatography after column derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. For comparison data (350 plasma samples) from 51 patients treated according to the protocol COALL-05-92 were available. The same method for detection of asn in plasma was used. RESULTS: The median asparagine level in plasma after 2,500 IU/m(2) PEG-ASNase i.v. was below the limit of detection for at least 5 weeks in 81 % of the patients. When divided into high risk (HR) and low risk (LR) group, HR patients who had previously received one dose more of C-ASNase showed a markedly shorter depletion than the LR patients compatible with a higher risk of antibody formation and consequent silent inactivation after a higher number of exposures to ASNase. In the previous protocol COALL-05-92 median asn levels in plasma after 45,000 IU/m(2) native C-ASNase i.v. were below the limit of detection for at least 5 weeks in 65 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: 2,500 IU/m(2) PEG-ASNase led to an equally long depletion of asn in plasma as did 45,000 IU/m(2) native C-ASNase i.v. used in COALL-05-92.","['Wenner, K A', 'Vieira Pinheiro, J P', 'Escherich, G', 'Wessalowski, R', 'Jorch, N', 'Wolff, J', 'Stehn, M', 'Kohlschutter, A', 'Boos, J', 'Janka-Schaub, G E']","['Wenner KA', 'Vieira Pinheiro JP', 'Escherich G', 'Wessalowski R', 'Jorch N', 'Wolff J', 'Stehn M', 'Kohlschutter A', 'Boos J', 'Janka-Schaub GE']","[""University Children's Hospital, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Hamburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Asparagine/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/immunology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-872516 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2005 Nov-Dec;217(6):321-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-872516.,,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty percent of the patients can be cured, but clinical subgroups with a dismal outcome can still be identified. In this study, we investigated the association of age with prognosis in 5 181 patients with ALL under 18 years (y) of age enrolled in the three consecutive treatment trials ALL-BFM 86, 90 and 95 in more than 80 centers. Event-free survival (pEFS) of the total group was significantly associated with age. The most unfavorable outcome was found in infancy and the best results were achieved at toddler and pre-school age. Beyond 5 y of age, survival probability decreased (pEFS at 8 y: < 1 y = 0.45; 1-5 y = 0.82; 6-9 y = 0.75; 10-14 y = 0.63; > or = 15 y = 0.59). The proportion of T-ALL as compared to precursor B-cell ALL (pB-ALL) was lower in younger children, due to an incidence peak of pB-ALL in toddlers and at pre-school age compared to a constant incidence of T-ALL. Within the T-ALL group, no correlation of age with sex, initial white blood cell count, CNS disease, or early treatment response was found. Children under 10 y of age had a slightly lower relapse rate compared to older patients. Within pB-ALL patients, the proportion as well as the absolute incidence of TEL/AML1 rearrangement and DNA index of > or = 1.16 was higher in the younger children. A lower proportion of BCR/ABL-positive ALL was observed in the age group of < 6 y when compared to patients aged > or = 6 y, but the absolute incidence was constant across the age groups after the first year of life. More than half of the infants had a CD10-negative pB-ALL. The incidence was constant after a peak in the first year of life, yet the percentage of CD10 negativity increased with rising age in this subgroup. Adolescents with pB-ALL had a significantly higher proportion of prednisone poor-responders. Accordingly, outcome was worse in older patients. This pattern was also evident in the biologically heterogeneous group of patients with a DNA index of > or = 1.16. In contrast, no significant age-related outcome differences could be shown within TEL/AML1- or BCR/ABL-positive patients, as well as within CD10-negative pB-ALL beyond infant age. Analysis of the pB-ALL group in a Cox's regression model including age and the above-listed biological factors revealed age < 1 year and > or = 10 years as independent risk factors. This is in line with the poorer prognosis of these age groups in the pB-ALL subgroup without specific biological characteristics. This subgroup also had an incidence peak at toddler age, presumably containing other favorable biological subsets. An independent prognostic impact of age in pediatric ALL cannot be excluded by this study. However, our analyses show that the age-associated different prognosis in childhood ALL is at least partly related to the different distribution of relevant prognostic subgroups between the age groups.","['Moricke, A', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Gadner, H', 'Odenwald, E', 'Harbott, J', 'Ludwig, W-D', 'Riehm, H', 'Schrappe, M']","['Moricke A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reiter A', 'Gadner H', 'Odenwald E', 'Harbott J', 'Ludwig WD', 'Riehm H', 'Schrappe M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. a.moericke@pediatrics.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-872515 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2005 Nov-Dec;217(6):310-20. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-872515.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol', 'ALL-BFM-95 protocol', 'BFM-86 protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine relapses involved the central nervous system (CNS) and one the skin, of which two were isolated EM relapse. In patients with EM disease, median WBC count was 26950/mm3 (7700-162000). The 3-year cumulative incidence of EM disease at first relapse was 5.0%.

However, the effect of DAC in changing the differentiation and proliferation behavior of normal human myeloid progenitors has rarely been investigated. Therefore, we established an in vitro model of normal hematopoietic differentiation, using CD34+ cells from mobilized peripheral blood, to study proliferation and colony formation, expression of several myeloid maturation markers and of the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases p15/INK4b. Upon DAC treatment, cell growth was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, without an increase in cytotoxicity. DAC treatment also resulted in a substantial increase of lysozyme-positive cells, which could be enhanced by G-CSF, a modest increase of myeloperoxidase+ and CD15+ cells, as well as an increase of colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) compared to control cells. p15/INK4b protein expression was strongly upregulated upon myeloid maturation, and additional DAC treatment did not change p15 expression or the methylation status of the p15 promoter at the noncytotoxic concentrations used. Taken together, these data indicate a role of DAC in changing myeloid progenitor cell expansion and differentiation. This model appears suitable also for global analyses of multiple differentially methylated genes.","['Guo, Y', 'Engelhardt, M', 'Wider, D', 'Abdelkarim, M', 'Lubbert, M']","['Guo Y', 'Engelhardt M', 'Wider D', 'Abdelkarim M', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Muramidase/biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism']",,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404019 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404019 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jan;20(1):115-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404019.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this material, similar allele and genotype frequencies of the Bax polymorphism were demonstrated in CLL patients and controls (n=207), where 19 and 21% carried this polymorphism, respectively, and no skewed distribution of the polymorphism was evident between different Binet stages and VH mutated and unmutated CLLs. Furthermore, no difference in overall survival was shown between patients displaying the G(-248)A polymorphism or not (median survival 85 and 102 months, respectively, P=0.21), and the polymorphism did not influence outcome specifically in treated CLL.

However, the relative merits of each may differ in different settings. To define the role of dose intensity, we analyzed SCT outcomes of 112 consecutive patients with AML/MDS. A total of 45 patients met eligibility criteria for standard myeloablative conditioning and were given intravenous-busulfan (12.8 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (ivBuCy). A total of 67 noneligible patients were given RIC with fludarabine and intravenous-busulfan (6.4 mg/kg, FB2, n=41) or a modified myeloablative regimen with fludarabine and myeloablative doses of intravenous-busulfan (12.8 mg/kg, FB4, n=26).

Active disease at SCT was the most significant predictor of reduced survival in multivariable analysis (HR 4.5, P=0.0001). Myeloablative and RIC regimens had similar outcomes when leukemia was in remission at SCT; however, patients with active disease could only be salvaged by myeloablative conditioning.

When compared with the general population, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 17.5, 95% confidence interval: 10.3-31.4). At multivariate analysis, the initial variables associated with an increased risk of thrombosis were thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, P=0.001), presence of one cardiovascular risk factor (arterial hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes, P=0.003), cellular phase of myelofibrosis (P=0.005), and Hb >11 g/dl (P=0.02). Considering post-diagnosis events, the 5-year thrombosis-free survival probability was 90.4% in the series, 80.6% for patients with platelets >450 x 10(9)/l, 82.6% for patients with one cardiovascular risk factor, and 85.1% for those in cellular phase.

Sanchez, A. K. McElroy, J. Yen, S. Tamrakar, C. L. Clark, R. A. Schwartz, and D. H. Spector, J. Virol. 78:11219-11232, 2004). To determine if this was associated with specific phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) large subunit by cdk7/cyclin H and cdk9/cyclin T1, we examined the expression and localization of these kinases and the various phosphorylated forms of RNAP II. Infection resulted in increased RNAP II CTD phosphorylated on serines 2 and 5 and increased levels of activity of cdk7 and cdk9. At early times, cdk9 localizes with input viral DNA, and aggregates of cdk9 and cdk7 and a subset of Ser2-phosphorylated RNAP II colocalize with IE1/IE2 proteins adjacent to promyelocytic leukemia protein oncogenic domains. Later, cdk9 and Ser2-phosphorylated RNAP II form a nuclear punctate pattern; cdk7 resides in replication centers, and Ser5-phosphorylated RNAP II clusters at the peripheries of replication centers. Roscovitine treatment leads to decreased levels of hyperphosphorylated RNAP II (RNAP IIo) in infected cells and of hypophosphorylated RNAP II in mock-infected and infected cells. The RNAP IIo decrease does not occur if roscovitine is added 8 h postinfection, as was previously observed for processing of IE transcripts. These results suggest that accurate IE gene expression requires specific phosphorylation of the RNAP II CTD early in infection.","['Tamrakar, Sama', 'Kapasi, Anokhi J', 'Spector, Deborah H']","['Tamrakar S', 'Kapasi AJ', 'Spector DH']","['Cellular and Molecular Medicine East, Room 2059, Mail Code 0712, 9500 Gilman Drive, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/24/15477 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.24.15477-15493.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Dec;79(24):15477-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.24.15477-15493.2005.,"['R01 CA034729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",,,PMC1316045,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) to other restricted (human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [HIV-1], equine infectious anemia virus [EIAV]) and unrestricted (NB-tropic murine leukemia virus [NB-MLV]) retroviruses across wide ranges of viral inputs in cells from multiple primate and nonprimate species. We also characterized restrictions conferred to permissive feline and canine cells engineered to express rhesus and human TRIM5alpha proteins and performed RNA interference (RNAi) against endogenous TRIM5alpha. We find that expression of rhesus or human TRIM5alpha proteins in feline cells restricts FIV, impairing pseudotyped vector transduction and viral replication, but rhesus TRIM5alpha is more restricting than human TRIM5alpha. Notably, however, canine cells did not support restriction by human TRIM5alpha and supported minimal restriction by rhesus TRIM5alpha, suggesting that these proteins may not function autonomously or that a canine factor interferes. Stable RNAi knockdown of endogenous rhesus TRIM5alpha resulted in marked increases in FIV and HIV-1 infectivities while having no effect on NB-MLV. A panel of nonprimate cell lines varied widely in susceptibility to lentiviral vector transduction, but normalized FIV and HIV-1 vectors varied concordantly. In contrast, in human and monkey cells, relative restriction of FIV compared to HIV-1 varied from none to substantial, with the greatest relative infectivity deficit for FIV vectors observed in human T-cell lines. Endogenous and introduced TRIM5alpha restrictions of FIV could be titrated by coinfections with FIV, HIV-1, or EIAV virus-like particles. Arsenic trioxide had complex and TRIM5alpha-independent enhancing effects on lentiviral but not NB-MLV infection.

The olfactory epithelium was normal until postnatal 3 weeks but was not maintained later than 4 weeks in HSF1-null mice. The olfactory epithelium was atrophied with increased cell death of olfactory sensory neurons. Analysis of the epithelium revealed that induction of HSP expression and reduction of LIF expression are lacking in adult HSF1-null mice. We found that DNA binding activity of HSF1 is induced in the olfactory epithelium later than 4 weeks and that HSF1 binds directly to Lif gene and inhibits its expression. HSF4 has opposing effects on LIF expression and olfactory neurogenesis.

RNA 5'-end-directed cleavages represent a form of RNase H activity that is carried out on RNA/DNA hybrids that contain a recessed RNA 5'-end. Previously, the distance from the RNA 5'-end has been considered the primary determinant for the location of these cleavages. Employing model hybrid substrates and the HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptases, we demonstrate that cleavage sites correlate with specific sequences and that the distance from the RNA 5'-end determines the extent of cleavage. An alignment of sequences flanking multiple RNA 5'-end-directed cleavage sites reveals that both enzymes strongly prefer A or U at the +1 position and C or G at the -2 position, and additionally for HIV-1, A is disfavored at the -4 position. For both enzymes, 5'-end-directed cleavages occurred when sites were positioned between the 13th and 20th nucleotides from the RNA 5'-end, a distance termed the cleavage window. In examining the importance of accessibility to the RNA 5'-end, it was found that the extent of 5'-end-directed cleavages observed in substrates containing a free recessed RNA 5'-end was most comparable to substrates with a gap of two or three bases between the upstream and downstream RNAs. Together these finding demonstrate that the selection of 5'-end-directed cleavage sites by retroviral RNases H results from a combination of nucleotide sequence, permissible distance, and accessibility to the RNA 5'-end.","['Schultz, Sharon J', 'Zhang, Miaohua', 'Champoux, James J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Zhang M', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA/chemistry/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology/genetics', 'Ribonuclease H/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)70743-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M510504200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Jan 27;281(4):1943-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M510504200.

These modifications include, among several, acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation of several histone amino acid residues and are associated with different states of chromatin configuration and gene expression. In particular, acetylation of specific residues in histones H3 and H4 has been associated with an open chromatin configuration and a permissive gene transcription state. This particular modification is regulated by several enzymatic activities with the capacity to either transfer acetyl groups or to induce histone deacetylation. This last activity is associated with gene silencing. Several agents have been shown to have histone deacetylase inhibitory activity (HDACI). In vitro, experiments in multiple neoplastic cancer cell lines have demonstrated that treatment with HDACIs results in increased global and gene specific histone acetylation, and reactivation of aberrantly silenced genes. This phenomenon has been associated with cell differentiation and induction of apoptosis. Based on these observations, several of these agents are now in clinical development both for solid tumor and hematological malignancies. In this article, we provide a brief introduction to the field of histone deacetylation inhibition in cancer and review the most relevant clinical data so far published.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans']",70,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['R24T542302520343 [pii]', '10.1080/07357900500283119 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2005;23(7):635-42. doi: 10.1080/07357900500283119.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1957 and 1965, numerous reports of bone marrow transplants, many of which were successful, were published for patients with irradiation injury, aplastic anemia, leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. Sources of marrow were autologous, isologous, and homologous (often unrelated, including cadaveric) donors. Bone marrow infusion was shown to be safe. It was also demonstrated that an aliquot of marrow, removed (harvested) from the ileum, had sufficient hematopoietic stem cells (SC) to repopulate the marrow and restore blood counts after myeloablation. For about 20 yr, bone marrow was the only source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for transplantation. The first reported autologous peripheral blood HSC transplant was recorded in 1981 using chemotherapy 'mobilized' SC collected by leukapheresis. Mobilization is defined for these purposes to be any treatment that enhances the number of HSC in the blood such that the collection contains sufficient HSC to repopulate the marrow and restore blood counts after myeloablation. Since the early 1990s, SCT using blood-derived stem cells has become very popular and very common. The principal reason is that mobilized (whether by H growth factor or during recovery after chemotherapy) blood-derived stem cells engraft more rapidly than do marrow-derived stem cells. On the one hand, bone marrow was always harvested in the resting, unperturbed state (steady state). On the other hand, blood stem cells (BSC) were virtually always collected after mobilization, usually with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). There is one report of collection of steady state BSC used for transplantation, and slow engraftment was documented. Bone marrow was never harvested after either chemotherapy or growth factor (priming). It is the mobilization (most often with G-CSF alone or after chemotherapy) of BSC that produces more rapid engraftment than for steady state marrow stem cells (MSC). This contribution shows the data that changes the old paradigm to a new paradigm which states bone MSC and BSC engraft identically if collected after the same pretreatment of the donor with growth factor.","['Elfenbein, Gerald J']",['Elfenbein GJ'],"['Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02038, USA. gelfenbe@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",29,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTR444 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00444.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2005 Dec;9 Suppl 7:37-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00444.x.,,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate binds to the inactive conformation of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase suppressing the Philadelphia chromosome positive clone in CML. Clinical studies have yielded impressive results in all phases of CML. With higher rates of complete cytogenetic response with imatinib, molecular monitoring of disease is now advisable in assessing response and determining prognosis. Emergence of resistance to imatinib may be manifest at the hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular levels in patients who remain in chronic phase, or may be evidenced by the development of more advanced CML phases. Resistance and eventual clinical failure of imatinib occurs in most patients with blastic phase disease. Resistance may occur at the level of Bcr-Abl, with reduction or loss of imatinib effectiveness as a kinase inhibitor, or, despite retention of its inhibitory ability, with changes in the ability to deliver an effective dose at the cellular level, and/or, the leukemia becoming less dependent on Bcr-Abl. The various mechanisms underlying these differing, non-mutually exclusive, mechanisms of resistance must be understood to develop corresponding therapeutic remedies.

The removal of plutonium by chelating agents is of great importance because plutonium is extremely dangerous and induces cancer due to radiation toxicity. Similarly, uranium is a radionuclide, which causes severe renal dysfunction within a short time period due to chemical toxicity. It may also induce cancers such as leukemia and osteosarcoma in cases of long-term internal radiation exposure. Investigations on chelating agents for the removal of plutonium were initiated in the 1960's and 1970's. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) is recognized as a chelating agent that accelerates the excretion of plutonium in early treatment after an accident. Thereafter, there has long been an interest in finding new chelating agents with radionuclide removal properties for use in therapy, and many chelating agents such as 3,4,3-LIHOPO and CBMIDA have been studied for their ability to remove plutonium and uranium. Recently, the focus has turned to drugs that have been used successfully in the treatment of a variety of other diseases, for example the iron chelating drug deferiprone or 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one (L1), which is used in thalassaemia and ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-bisphosphonate (EHBP), which is used in osteoporosis. Within this context, it is important to examine the clinical use of these two drugs as well as the properties of the experimental chelators 3,4,3-LIHOPO and CBMIDA in order to identify possible uses in the treatment of radiation workers contaminated with plutonium and uranium.","['Fukuda, Satoshi']",['Fukuda S'],"['Research Center for Radiation Emergency Medicine, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Anagawa 4-9-1, Inage-ku, Chiba 263-8555 Japan. s_fukuda@nirs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,IM,"['Animals', 'Aza Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Catechols/therapeutic use', 'Chelating Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Deferiprone', 'Diphosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Pentetic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Plutonium/*toxicity', 'Pyridones/therapeutic use', 'Radiation Injuries/*drug therapy', 'Uranium/*toxicity']",71,2005/11/25 09:00,2006/02/09 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/092986705774463012 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2005;12(23):2765-70. doi: 10.2174/092986705774463012.,,"['0 (Aza Compounds)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-bisphosphonate)', '144674-91-9', ""(N,N',N'',N'''-tetra(1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2-oxopyridine-6-carbonyl)-1,5,10,14-te"", 'traazatetradecane)', '2BTY8KH53L (Deferiprone)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', '82773-07-7 (catechol-3,6-bis(methyleneiminodiacetic acid))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in the four decades since this discovery, the majority of cancers still cannot be cured by chemotherapy. Clinical evidence supports the hypothesis of Goldie and Coldman that treating cancers with all the available effective agents simultaneously provides the greatest chance of eliciting a cure. Unfortunately, for traditional cytotoxic agents with narrow therapeutic indices, life-threatening toxicity precludes combination chemotherapy regimens employing multiple agents. This review discusses the concept of fixed dose combination chemotherapy with emphasis on capturing therapeutic efficacy described as synergistic as a basis for improving the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy. The use of lipid-based nanotechnologies, focusing on liposomes, as an enabling technology to facilitate the delivery of cytotoxic agents to the tumour site at concentrations and/or drug ratios judged to be synergistic will be discussed. It is envisaged that the development of this model system will be supported by cell-based screening technologies, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and mathematical models describing therapeutic drug:drug interactions (the Median Effect Principle of Chou and Talalay). Experiments using preclinical models are presented to support the benefits of drug delivery systems as a foundation for fixed dose anticancer drug combinations. The ultimate goal of this research is to prepare a 'single vial' fixed dose combination product that encompasses both traditional cytotoxic agents and new molecularly targeted modalities with optimum therapeutic effects and acceptable toxicity.","['Ramsay, Euan C', 'Dos Santos, Nancy', 'Dragowska, Wieslawa H', 'Laskin, Janessa J', 'Bally, Marcel B']","['Ramsay EC', 'Dos Santos N', 'Dragowska WH', 'Laskin JJ', 'Bally MB']","['Advanced Therapeutics, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada. eramsay@bccrc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Deliv,Current drug delivery,101208455,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', '*Nanotechnology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",104,2005/11/25 09:00,2005/12/16 09:00,['2005/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156720105774370294 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Drug Deliv. 2005 Oct;2(4):341-51. doi: 10.2174/156720105774370294.,,['0 (Liposomes)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-two patients with CML underwent allogeneic SCT from HLA matched siblings. Patients were divided into standard (n=14) and high-risk (n=8) groups. Patients were subjected to conditioning regimens consisting of Busulphan and Cyclophosphamide. Cyclosporin, Prednisolone and Methotrexate were given for GvHD prophylaxis. All donors were subjected to PBSC harvest after G-CSF therapy for five days. All received G-CSF from Day+5 until ANC >0.5 x 10(9)/l. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 29 years (range 7-53 years) with a male to female ratio of 6.3:1. Engraftment was achieved in all patients. Median time to achieve neutrophil (ANC 0.5 x 10(9)/l) and platelet (20 x 10(9)/l) recovery was 13 days and 12 days respectively. Median stay in hospital was 18 days. Acute GvHD (Grade-II-IV) was observed in eleven patients (50%) while chronic GvHD was seen in four patients (18%). One patient relapsed 8 months post transplant. Two patients (9%) developed Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) liver. One patient had haemorrhagic cystitis. Four patients (18%) had post transplant infectious complications, which included pseudomonas septicemia, aspergillosis, tuberculous pleural effusion and herpes zoster. Overall mortality was 22.7% (n=5). The major causes of mortality were VOD liver, GvHD grade IV, Pseudomonas septicaemia and aspergillosis. Overall survival was 77.2% (n=17) and disease free survival was (n=16) 72.7%. Follow up ranges were from 23 to 828 days (median 212 days). CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of SCT in this small series of patients with CML are very encouraging. To improve the long-term survival it is imperative that patients are transplanted early after diagnosis and conditioning regimens are selected carefully.","['Hashmi, KhalilUllah', 'Khan, Badshah', 'Ahmed, Parvez', 'Hussain, Iftikhar', 'Raza, Shahid', 'Iqbal, Hamid', 'Malik, Hamid Saeed', 'Kamal, Muhammad Khalid', 'Anwar, Masood']","['Hashmi K', 'Khan B', 'Ahmed P', 'Hussain I', 'Raza S', 'Iqbal H', 'Malik HS', 'Kamal MK', 'Anwar M']","['Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

The data of the peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) was matched with databases of proteomics available on the Internet. Results showed that 16 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed between HL-60/DOX and HL-60 cells.

We have previously reported that signaling via the collagen type I (Coll I) receptor, alpha2beta1 integrin, inhibited FasL expression and protected Jurkat T cells from activation-induced cell death (AICD). In this study, we examined whether Coll I signaling in T cells also modulates the expression of the human receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), a recently identified TNF family member which has important functions in osteoclastogenesis, cell survival and apoptosis. Our results show that in both Jurkat T cells and human primary T cells, Coll I signaling significantly reduces activation-induced RANKL expression by 50-60%. We also found that RANKL is not involved in AICD but participates in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of leukemia T cell lines including Jurkat, CEM and HSB-2. In this respect, Coll I protected leukemia T cell lines from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting doxorubicin-induced RANKL expression. Together, our results suggest that by limiting the production of RANKL, Coll I signaling may contribute to the resistance of leukemia T cells to chemotherapy. Our study also emphasizes the importance Coll I signaling may have in the control of RANKL-associated T cell functions.","['Gendron, Steve', 'Couture, Julie', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi']","['Gendron S', 'Couture J', 'Aoudjit F']","['Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie/Immunologie CHUQ, Pavillon CHUL, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'RANK Ligand', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', '*Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism']",,2005/11/24 09:00,2006/07/26 09:00,['2005/11/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200535065 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2005 Dec;35(12):3673-82. doi: 10.1002/eji.200535065.,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (TNFRSF11A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now have investigated CDD (over-)expression in the human hematopoietic system. Retroviral gene transfer significantly increased the resistance of CDD-transduced cord blood and peripheral blood-derived progenitor cells for doses ranging from 20-100 nM cytarabine and 8-10 nM gemcitabine. Protection was observed for progenitors of erythroid as well as myeloid differentiation, though the degree of protection varied for individual drugs. In addition, significant selection of CDD-transduced cells was obtained after a 4-day culture in 30-100 nM cytarabine. Thus, our data demonstrate that overexpression of CDD cDNA results in significant protection of human progenitors from cytarabine- as well as gemcitabine-induced toxicity, and allows in vitro selection of transduced cells. This strongly argues for a potential therapeutic role of CDD gene transfer in conjunction with dose-intensive cytarabine- or gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen.","['Bardenheuer, W', 'Lehmberg, K', 'Rattmann, I', 'Brueckner, A', 'Schneider, A', 'Sorg, U R', 'Seeber, S', 'Moritz, T', 'Flasshove, M']","['Bardenheuer W', 'Lehmberg K', 'Rattmann I', 'Brueckner A', 'Schneider A', 'Sorg UR', 'Seeber S', 'Moritz T', 'Flasshove M']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center, University of Duisburg-Essen Medical School, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2005/11/24 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/11/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403977 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403977 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2281-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403977.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consecutive analyses of blood samples taken up to 2 years following HCT, demonstrated that CD8+ T-cell clonality was highly dynamic in the early phases after HCT, but became more stable after 4-5 months. Moreover, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) given for disease progression in one of the patients led to establishment of recurrent as well as new T-cell clonotypes. This coincided with disease remission, strongly suggesting that these T cells were engaged with anti-CLL cytotoxicity. To examine the functional capacity of stable clonally expanded T cells after HCT, CD8+ T cells isolated post-transplant from the recipients were stimulated ex vivo with CLL cells and subsequently analyzed by FACS for surface expression of the marker for cytotoxic activity, CD107a. Stimulation with CLL cells indeed led to surface expression of CD107a, and clonotype analyses of sorted cells demonstrated that CD107a positive T cells were stably expanded following HCT.

MRC AML 10 tested the role of bone marrow transplantation following four blocks of intensive chemotherapy and found that while both allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo-BMT) and autologous bone marrow transplant (A-BMT) significantly reduced the relapse risk (RR), this did not translate into a significant improvement in overall survival (OS). A risk group stratification based on cytogenetics and response to the first course of chemotherapy derived from MRC AML 10 was used to deliver risk-directed therapy in MRC AML 12. Allo-BMT was limited to standard and poor risk patients and A-BMT was not employed. Instead, the benefit of an additional block of treatment was tested by randomising children to receive either four or five blocks of treatment in total. While the results of MRC AML 12 remain immature, there appears to be no survival advantage for a fifth course of treatment. The 5 year OS, disease-free survival (DFS), event-free survival (EFS) and RR in MRC AML 12 are 66, 61, 56 and 35%, respectively; at present superior to MRC AML 10, which had a 5-year OS, DFS, EFS and RR of 58, 53, 49 and 42%, respectively. MRC AML trials employ a short course of triple intrathecal chemotherapy alone for CNS-directed treatment and CNS relapse is uncommon. Improvements in supportive care have contributed to improved outcomes and the number of deaths in remission fell between trials. Anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity remains a concern and the current MRC AML 15 trial tests the feasibility of reducing anthracycline dosage without compromising outcome by comparing standard MRC anthracycline-based consolidation with high-dose ara-C. MRC studies suggest that the role of allo-BMT is limited in 1st CR and that there may be a ceiling of benefit from current or conventional chemotherapy.","['Gibson, B E S', 'Wheatley, K', 'Hann, I M', 'Stevens, R F', 'Webb, D', 'Hills, R K', 'De Graaf, S S N', 'Harrison, C J']","['Gibson BE', 'Wheatley K', 'Hann IM', 'Stevens RF', 'Webb D', 'Hills RK', 'De Graaf SS', 'Harrison CJ']","['Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK. brenda.gibson@yorkhill.scot.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Protocols/*standards', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/11/24 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/11/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403924 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403924 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2130-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403924.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of haemorrhage, especially in children with hyperleukocytosis, proved the high relevance of supportive care. In AML-BFM 87, the benefit of CNS irradiation in preventing CNS/systemic relapses was demonstrated.

Unfortunately, the science of bone regeneration is still in its infancy, with all current or emerging therapies having serious limitations. Unlike current regenerative therapies that use single regenerative factors, the natural processes of bone formation and repair require the coordinated expression of many molecules, including growth factors, bone morphogenetic proteins, and specific transcription factors. As will be developed in this article, future advances in bone regeneration will likely incorporate therapies that mimic critical aspects of these natural biological processes, using the tools of gene therapy and tissue engineering. This review will summarize current knowledge related to normal bone development and fracture repair, and will describe how gene therapy, in combination with tissue engineering, may mimic critical aspects of these natural processes. Current gene therapy approaches for bone regeneration will then be summarized, including recent work where combinatorial gene therapy was used to express groups of molecules that synergistically interacted to stimulate bone regeneration. Last, proposed future directions for this field will be discussed, where regulated gene expression systems will be combined with cells seeded in precise three-dimensional configurations on synthetic scaffolds to control both temporal and spatial distribution of regenerative factors. It is the premise of this article that such approaches will eventually allow us to achieve the ultimate goal of bone tissue engineering: to reconstruct entire bones with associated joints, ligaments, or sutures.

Hodgkin disease, myeloma, and low-grade lymphoid malignancies have been the diseases most impacted by RIC regimens. RIC regimens have also been shown to be safe and effective in older patients as well as patients with co-morbidities, although patients with chemorefractory disease still have high relapse rates and poor outcomes. Patients with chemosensitive disease have outcomes similar to those obtained with conventional ablative therapies, and thus comparative trials are warranted.

They are characterized by increased blood cell production related to cytokine hypersensitivity and virtually normal cell maturation. The molecular pathogenesis of the MPDs has been poorly understood, except for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where the Bcr-Abl fusion protein exhibits constitutive kinase activity. Since some rare MPDs are also related to a dysregulated kinase activity, a similar mechanism was thought to be likely responsible for the more frequent MPDs. We investigated the mechanisms of endogenous erythroid colony formation (EEC) by polycythemia vera (PV) erythroid progenitor cells and found that EEC formation was abolished by a pharmacological inhibitor of JAK2 as well as an siRNA against JAK2. JAK2 sequencing revealed a unique mutation in the JH2 domain leading to a V617F substitution in more than 80% of the PV samples. This mutation in the pseudokinase autoinhibitory domain results in constitutive kinase activity and induces cytokine hypersensitivity or independence of factor-dependent cell lines. Retroviral transduction of the mutant JAK2 into murine HSC leads to the development of an MPD with polycythemia. The same mutation was found in about 50% of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) and 30% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Using different approaches, four other teams have obtained similar results. The identification of the JAK2 mutation represents a major advance in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MPDs that will likely permit a new classification of these diseases and the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","['Vainchenker, William', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N']","['Vainchenker W', 'Constantinescu SN']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U 362, IFR 54, PR1, Villejuif 94800, France. verpre@igr.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Although imatinib is highly effective initially and generally well-tolerated, relapse is increasingly encountered clinically. Until recently, for the majority of CML patients with disease no longer responsive to imatinib, as well as for patients with imatinib intolerance, few effective therapeutic options existed. Our understanding of the major mechanisms of imatinib resistance has led to the clinical development of two novel BCR-ABL inhibitors that harbor significant therapeutic promise in early clinical trial experience. These agents, dasatinib (BMS-354825) and AMN107, are more potent inhibitors of BCR-ABL than imatinib, and moreover, harbor activity against nearly all imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain mutant forms tested in vitro. Notably, neither of these compounds is effective against the imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL/T315I mutation. The potential availability of highly effective medications for the treatment of imatinib-resistant and intolerant cases of CML is expected to further complicate the timing of other effective therapies, such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Additionally, periodic genotyping of the BCR-ABL kinase domain to screen for drug-resistant mutations may play an increasingly important role in the future management of CML cases.","['Shah, Neil P']",['Shah NP'],"['University of California - Los Angeles, 11-934 Louis Factor Building, Box 951678, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. nshah@ucla.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The probability of progression free survival is tightly correlated with the level of response, approaching 100% in those patients who achieve a reduction of BCR-ABL mRNA by at least 3-log at 12 months. High Sokal risk predicts poorer outcome, but on-treatment response parameters generally override pretherapeutic prognostic variables. Standard disease monitoring includes full blood counts, cytogenetics and quantitative RT-PCR for BCR-ABL mRNA but must be tailored to the level of response attained by a given patient. Conservative therapeutic milestones include a complete hematologic response at 3 months, a minor cytogenetic response at 6, a major cytogenetic response at 12 and CCR at 18, but a more aggressive approach may be justified in specific circumstances. Failure to achieve any of these milestones should trigger a re-assessment of the therapeutic strategy. Most patients with CCR remain positive by RT-PCR, and discontinuation of drug is usually followed by relapse, suggesting that imatinib fails to eradicate leukemic stem cells. The mechanisms underlying disease persistence are not well understood. Evidence is accumulating that early therapy intensification using high doses of imatinib (800 mg daily) or imatinib in combination with cytarabine or interferon-alpha may induce higher rates of RT-PCR negativity.

However, there has been little progress in the treatment of older adults. This disappointing observation is important because the median age of patients with AML is about 70 years. Approximately 60%-80% of younger adults with AML achieve complete remission (CR) with the cytotoxic agents cytarabine and an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin or the anthracenedione mitoxantrone. However, only 30%-40% of such patients are alive and disease-free at 5 years. Among older adults, CR is achieved in 40%-55%, but there are very few long-term survivors. Many studies have evaluated the impact of alternative doses and schedules, as well as additional cytotoxic drugs, on the prognosis for this group of patients. The outcome has not improved substantially beyond that achieved with conventional doses of an anthracycline and cytarabine followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation.Several factors identified at diagnosis can predict outcome. The most important of these is the karyotype of the leukemic cells. Another critical factor is the presence of transmembrane transporter proteins, which confer multidrug resistance and mutations in or overexpression of specific genes such as WT1, C/EBPalpha, BAX, and BCL-2/BAX ratio, BAALC, EVI1, KIT and FLT3. The development of specific agents directed at gene mutations, signal transduction pathways and unique cell surface antigens provide the foundation for new therapeutic strategies. Such agents include the immunoconjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin, multidrug resistance inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase and proteosome inhibitors, antiangiogenesis agents, FLT3 inhibitors, apoptosis inhibitors, and nucleoside analogs. All of these agents can potentially address the heterogeneous abnormalities in AML and significantly improve the outcome for patients.","['Tallman, Martin S']",['Tallman MS'],"['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Robert H.

VAN serum concentration data (n = 1,004) from therapeutic drug monitoring were collected retrospectively from 215 patients. A one-compartment PK model was selected. VAN pharmacokinetics population parameters were generated using the NONMEM program. A graphic approach and stepwise generalized additive modeling were used to elucidate the preliminary relationships between PK parameters and clinical covariates analyzed. Covariate selection revealed that total body weight (TBW) affected V, whereas renal function, estimated by creatinine clearance, and a diagnosis of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) influenced VAN clearance. We propose one general and two AML-specific models. The former was defined by CL (liters/h) = 1.08 x CL(CR(Cockcroft and Gault)) (liters/h); CV(CL) = 28.16% and V (liters) = 0.98 x TBW; CV(V) =37.15%. AML models confirmed this structure but with a higher clearance coefficient (1.17). The a priori performance of the models was evaluated in another 59 patients, and clinical suitability was confirmed. The models were fairly accurate, with more than 33% of the measured concentrations being within +/-20% of the predicted value. This therapeutic precision is twofold higher than that of a non-customized population model (16.1%).

We here show that BCR/ABL-, but not FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-transformed 32D cells or primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts undergo apoptosis after treatment with the HDI valproic acid (VPA) plus all-trans retinoic acid (VPA/ATRA). A particular VPA/ATRA responsiveness of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) was confirmed in a therapy-refractory patient in vivo. HDI-stimulated apoptosis in Ph+ cells was caspase dependent, but independent from Akt pathway inhibition. Conversely, separate blockage of the Akt/mTor-signaling pathway was a prerequisite for overcoming apoptosis resistance to VPA/ATRA in FLT3-ITD cells, and primary AML blasts (n = 9). In conclusion, constitutive Akt activation causes apoptosis resistance to VPA/ATRA in AML, but not in Ph+ leukemia. This warrants the application of HDI-based therapies in poor-risk Ph+ ALL, and the use of Akt/mTor inhibitors to overcome HDI resistance in AML.","['Cai, Dali', 'Wang, Ying', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Barth, Peter J', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Burchert, Andreas']","['Cai D', 'Wang Y', 'Ottmann OG', 'Barth PJ', 'Neubauer A', 'Burchert A']","['Universitatsklinikum Marburg und Giessen, Standort Marburg, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, und Immunologie, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,2005/11/24 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2005/11/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63911-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3317 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Mar 1;107(5):2094-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3317.

Since clear supportive laboratory evidence is lacking and biophysical plausibility of carcinogenicity of MFs is questioned, a causal relationship between childhood leukaemia and magnetic field exposure is not established. Among the alternative explanations, selection bias in epidemiological studies of MFs seems to be the most plausible hypothesis. In reviewing the epidemiological literature on ELF-MF exposure and childhood leukaemia, we found evidence both for and against the existence of selection bias. To evaluate the potential for selection bias, we examined the relationship of socioeconomic status to subject participation and exposure to MFs. We find that, often, reporting of selection processes in itself is biased and incomplete, making the interpretation and evaluation of a potential for bias difficult. However, if present, such a bias would have wide implications for case-control studies in general. We call for better reporting and for evaluation of the potential for selection bias in all case-control studies, as well as, for the development of novel methods in control selection and recruitment.","['Mezei, Gabor', 'Kheifets, Leeka']","['Mezei G', 'Kheifets L']","['Environment Department, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA. gmezei@epri.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Patient Selection', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Class']",41,2005/11/24 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2005/11/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyi245 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyi245 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2006 Apr;35(2):397-406. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyi245.

We evaluated 24 experimentally FeLV-infected cats for these parameters using real-time RT-PCR and PCR, cell culture assay and sandwich ELISA. We observed that shedding of viral RNA in saliva was a consistent feature in viremic cats. Latently FeLV-infected cats, displaying a very low proviral load, did not shed infectious virus in saliva, but occasionally shed viral RNA. Consequently, salivary shedding of FeLV RNA may not necessarily indicate a transmission potential for susceptible cats. This study also confirmed previous results from our laboratory, showing that a negative result for p27 in plasma, or for viral RNA in plasma or saliva does not exclude FeLV infection, considering that blood cells from those cats contained provirus. We also showed that FeLV RNA and DNA were stable for more than 64 days in saliva samples stored at room temperature. We conclude that the detection of FeLV RNA in saliva may be a useful indicator of viremia, and that the detection of salivary viral RNA by RT-PCR could become a reliable tool for the diagnosis of FeLV infection, which is facilitated by the low invasive method of collection of the samples.","['Gomes-Keller, M A', 'Tandon, R', 'Gonczi, E', 'Meli, M L', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, R', 'Lutz, H']","['Gomes-Keller MA', 'Tandon R', 'Gonczi E', 'Meli ML', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Lutz H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland. mgomes@vetclinics.unizh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/*diagnosis/virology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/*isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Saliva/*virology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Load/veterinary', 'Virus Latency', 'Virus Shedding']",,2005/11/24 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2005/11/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1135(05)00357-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.10.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2006 Jan 10;112(1):11-21. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.10.027.

As minimal residual disease (MRD) can accurately measure extremely low levels of lymphoblasts, it is a sensitive reflection of leukemia cell kill. We utilized MRD to compare the efficacy of Erwinia-asparaginase (Erwinia-asp) and E. coli-asparaginase (E. coli-asp) during induction therapy for childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Of 116 precursor-B ALL patients, 22 were treated with Erwinia-asp, 90 with E. coli-asp, and 4 were switched from E. coli-asp to Erwinia-asp. MRD levels at the end of induction were analyzed for 90 patients (Erwinia-asp = 16; E. coli-asp = 74). Patients were stratified into MRD > or =10(-2), between 10(-2)-10(-4) and < or =10(-4). Toxicity information during induction was available for 110 patients. RESULTS: MRD was the only significant prognosticator compared to conventional criteria. Patients treated with Erwinia-asp were 6.7 times more likely to have MRD levels > or =10(-2) (P = 0.031), reflecting slower lymphoblast clearance. While non-asparaginase related toxicities were similar in both groups, more E. coli-asp patients experienced severe asparaginase-related toxicity. CONCLUSION: E. coli-asp is superior to Erwinia-asp in childhood ALL induction. Although E. coli-asp is more toxic, this is balanced by better response to therapy. Early response to treatment as measured by MRD is a direct reflection of leukemic cell kill and is a significant prognosticator of eventual outcome, making it a good surrogate marker to evaluate the efficacy of induction drugs in childhood ALL.","['Kwok, Cecilia Sze', 'Kham, Shirley Kow', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Lin, Hai Peng', 'Quah, Thuan Chong', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng']","['Kwok CS', 'Kham SK', 'Ariffin H', 'Lin HP', 'Quah TC', 'Yeoh AE']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Erwinia/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/11/23 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2005/11/23 09:00'],"['2005/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20684 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Sep;47(3):299-304. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20684.,,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primitive forms are relatively rare, but the secondary forms--particularly in long-term corticosteroid therapy--are a relevant problem given the much longer survival in chronic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic renal insufficiency, leukaemia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Controlled, prospective studies to evaluate the results of prevention and therapy in children are still lacking. The basis of therapy is the correct daily intake of calcium and the use of vitamin D (or active metabolites). This helps the growing skeleton to restore its equilibrium in many cases. Restraining the long-term use of corticosteroids to the minimum effective dose and shorter duration is essential. In severe cases, particularly in the presence of fractures, bisphosphonates can be remarkably effective. In some cases, such as idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, the rule is spontaneous resolution, and the advisability of an aggressive drug therapy is discussed.","['Bianchi, Maria Luisa']",['Bianchi ML'],"['Bone Metabolism Unit, Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Via L.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An alternative method to remove erythrocytes by dextran differential sedimentation was employed. Respiratory burst (RB) was assessed in a flow cytometer by the oxidation of a fluorescent probe (dichlorodihydrofluorescein). Stimuli were phorbol ester (PMA) and zymosan. RESULTS: Granulocytes obtained with dextran sedimentation mounted a normal RB for the two stimuli but cells obtained by erythrocyte lysis were ineffective to respond to zymosan (P < 0.05). EGTA did not affect PMA-induced, but inhibited zymosan-induced RB (P < 0.05). PMA-induced RB was blocked by a protein kinase C inhibitor (P < 0.05), whereas zymosan was not. Microfilament integrity was essential for zymosan but not for PMA, whereas microtubule depolymerization does not seem to be essential for both stimuli. Granulocytes obtained from recently diagnosed leukemia patients responded relatively well to both stimuli but after chemotherapy, the response to zymosan was increased whereas cells were unable to respond to PMA. CONCLUSION: The use of the proposed method allows the study of both RB and phagocytosis, making it useful to study these granulocyte responses in the clinical and experimental settings.","['Lunardi, Fabiane', 'Lima, Jose Hermenio Cavalcante', 'Assreuy, Jamil']","['Lunardi F', 'Lima JH', 'Assreuy J']","['Department of Immunology, Centre of Biological Sciences, UFSC, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,IM,"['Adult', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Respiratory Burst/drug effects/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Zymosan/*pharmacology']",,2005/11/23 09:00,2006/05/09 09:00,['2005/11/23 09:00'],"['2004/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-9120(05)00299-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2006 Jan;39(1):78-85. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.10.005.

The authors developed selective CXCR4 antagonists, T22 and T140, initially as anti-HIV agents, which inhibit T cell line-tropic (X4-) HIV-1 infection through their specific binding to CXCR4. Recently, T140 analogues have also been shown to inhibit CXCL12-induced migration of breast cancer cells, leukaemia T cells, pancreatic cancer cells, small cell lung cancer cells, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells, pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells and so on in vitro. Biostable T140 analogues significantly suppressed pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer cells and melanoma cells in mice. Furthermore, these compounds significantly suppressed the delayed-type hypersensitivity response induced by sheep red blood cells and collagen-induced arthritis, which represent in vivo mouse models of arthritis. Thus, T140 analogues proved to be attractive lead compounds for chemotherapy of these problematic diseases. This article reviews recent research on T140 analogues, referring to several other CXCR4 antagonists.","['Tamamura, Hirokazu', 'Fujii, Nobutaka']","['Tamamura H', 'Fujii N']","['Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan. tamamura.mr@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', '*Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",92,2005/11/23 09:00,2006/06/29 09:00,['2005/11/23 09:00'],"['2005/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14728222.9.6.1267 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2005 Dec;9(6):1267-82. doi: 10.1517/14728222.9.6.1267.,,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally distinguished by the mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable region genes, the two poles are perhaps better identified by the expression of ZAP-70, a signalling molecule normally utilised by T cells rather than B cells, but anomalously expressed in the more aggressive subtype of CLL. Assaying ZAP-70 expression has become progressively simplified so that a directly stained flow cytometric test is currently being evaluated, and a version of this should shortly be available to routine laboratories. In addition, the understanding of the nature of CLL has been advanced rapidly and this should lead to new, better targeted therapies, which in contrast to the current armoury, will work better for the more malignant variants of CLL than for the more benign. In particular, ZAP-70 is especially attractive because its aberrant expression in tumour cells from the more aggressive forms of CLL requires the chaperoning action of activated heat-shock protein 90, which may be specifically inhibited.","['Hamblin, Angela D', 'Hamblin, Terry J']","['Hamblin AD', 'Hamblin TJ']","['Department of Medicine, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, BH7 7DW, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*enzymology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/*physiology']",139,2005/11/23 09:00,2006/06/29 09:00,['2005/11/23 09:00'],"['2005/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14728222.9.6.1165 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2005 Dec;9(6):1165-78. doi: 10.1517/14728222.9.6.1165.,,['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Spontaneous cortisol secretion was analysed in 39 children before and after BMT. Thirteen patients were conditioned with chemotherapy only (group 1), and 26 patients also with total body irradiation (TBI). In the TBI group, 14 patients had received no additional irradiation (group 2), whereas 12 patients had received cranial irradiation (CRT) previously (group 3). RESULTS: Before BMT, in comparison with group 1, mean morning cortisol was significantly lower in group 2 (252 vs 415 mmol/l, p = 0.004), but not in group 3 (vs 312 mmol/l, p = 0.12). There was no change in group 1 six months after BMT (to 379 nmol/l), whereas morning cortisol increased significantly in group 2 and group 3 (to 386 and 343 nmol/l, respectively; p < 0.05). The change in mean morning cortisol correlated negatively with pretransplant morning cortisol (r = -0.63, p < 0.001). Neither TBI nor CRT were associated with changes in morning cortisol. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous cortisol secretion is maintained after BMT irrespective of whether cranial or total body irradiation has been given or not.","['Frisk, Per', 'Gustafsson, Jan', 'Arvidson, Johan']","['Frisk P', 'Gustafsson J', 'Arvidson J']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. per.frisk@kbh.uu.se""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/08/02 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01812.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2005 Oct;94(10):1411-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01812.x.,,['WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented a Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) to estimate risk to exposed populations. METHODS: Estimates of the risk factor-burden relationships by age, sex, and WHO subregion were generated. Risk measurements (relative risks and mortality rates) for the health outcomes were determined primarily from studies published in peer review journals. The resulting burden was described as the attributable fraction of disease or injury, using both mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). RESULTS: The papers in this issue include discussions of worldwide mortality and morbidity from lung cancer, leukemia, and malignant mesothelioma arising from occupational exposures; mortality and morbidity from asthma, COPD, and pneumoconiosis; the global burden of low back pain; exposure to contaminated sharps injuries among health care workers; noise-induced hearing loss; and occupational injuries. Three papers focus on economic issues: estimation of net-costs for prevention of occupational low back pain; cost effectiveness of occupational health interventions; and the cost effectiveness of interventions in the prevention of silicosis. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the occupational health burden in the world is overwhelming, and the causes and mechanisms are multiple and complex.

To better advise policy makers, we assessed the global burden of disease and injury due to selected occupational hazards. This article presents an overview, and describes the methodology employed in the companion studies. METHODS: Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Comparative Risk Assessment methodology, we applied relative risk measures to the proportions of the population exposed to selected occupational hazards to estimate attributable fractions, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Numerous occupational risk factors had to be excluded due to inadequate global data. RESULTS: In 2000, the selected risk factors were responsible worldwide for 37% of back pain, 16% of hearing loss, 13% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 11% of asthma, 8% of injuries, 9% of lung cancer, and 2% of leukemia. These risks at work caused 850,000 deaths worldwide and resulted in the loss of about 24 million years of healthy life. Needlesticks accounted for about 40% of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infections and 4.4% of HIV infections in health care workers.

Inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other tyrosine kinases are either established in clinical practice or under clinical investigation.","['Guren, Tormod K', 'Christoffersen, Thoralf', 'Thoresen, G Hege', 'Wisloff, Finn', 'Dajani, Olav', 'Tveit, Kjell M']","['Guren TK', 'Christoffersen T', 'Thoresen GH', 'Wisloff F', 'Dajani O', 'Tveit KM']","['Farmakologisk institutt, Rikshospitalet, Universitetet i Oslo, Postboks 1057 Blindern, 0316 Oslo. t.k.guren@medisin.uio.no']",['nor'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cetuximab', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trastuzumab']",77,2005/11/22 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['1293637 [pii]'],ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2005 Nov 17;125(22):3115-9.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'K16AIQ8CTM (pertuzumab)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)', 'PQX0D8J21J (Cetuximab)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",,,,,Antitumormidler rettet mot tyrosinkinaser.,,,,,,,,,,

The median age was 39 years (range, 3-69), and stem cell source was bone marrow (n = 31), or peripheral blood progenitor cells (n = 30), or the combination of both (n = 4). The primary disease was solid tumors (n = 37), Hodgkin's disease (n = 13), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 10), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2) or myeloproliferative syndromes (n = 3). The types of MDS were as follows: RAEB (n = 1; 2%), RAEB-t (n = 3; 5%), or AML (n = 56; 87%). The median time between diagnosis and transplantation was 5 months (range, 3-86). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of 3-year overall and disease-free survival were 35% (95% CI: 21-49%) and 32% (95% CI: 18-45%), respectively. The median leukocyte engraftment was faster after transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells than with bone marrow: 12 (range, 9-26) vs 29 (range, 11-67) days (P<0.001). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 58% (95% CI: 44-72%) and of treatment-related mortality 12% (95% CI: 6-38%). Lower relapse rate was seen in patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1 vs non-CR1: 3 years: 48 vs 89%; P = 0.05). Furthermore, age beyond 40 years resulted in a higher treatment-related mortality (47 vs 7%; P = 0.01). In a multivariate analysis, transplantation in CR1 age as well as their interaction influenced overall survival significantly. Autologous transplantation may cure a substantial number of patients with treatment-related MDS/AML, especially if they are in CR1 and of younger age.","['Kroger, N', 'Brand, R', 'van Biezen, A', 'Cahn, J-Y', 'Slavin, S', 'Blaise, D', 'Sierra, J', 'Zander, A', 'Niederwieser, D', 'de Witte, T']","['Kroger N', 'Brand R', 'van Biezen A', 'Cahn JY', 'Slavin S', 'Blaise D', 'Sierra J', 'Zander A', 'Niederwieser D', 'de Witte T']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705226 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705226 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jan;37(2):183-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705226.,,,['Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Apr;39(8):509; author reply 509-10.

The bacterium avoids host innate defenses in part by infecting, surviving in, and propagating in neutrophils, as well as by inhibiting neutrophil apoptosis. However, the mechanisms of A. phagocytophilum survival in neutrophils and the inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein (Bcl-2 family) expression is maintained and that inhibition of procaspase-3 processing occurs in A. phagocytophilum-infected human neutrophils. An evaluation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) showed evidence of increased phosphorylation with infection. Moreover, antagonism of p38 MAPK by the inhibitor SB203580 reversed apoptosis inhibition in live or heat-killed A. phagocytophilum-infected neutrophils. A role for the autocrine or paracrine production of antiapoptotic interleukin 8 (IL-8) expressed with A. phagocytophilum infection was excluded by the use of IL-8-, IL-8R1 (CXCR1)-, and IL-8R2 (CXCR2)-blocking antibodies. As previously demonstrated, the antiapoptotic effect was initially mediated by exposure to A. phagocytophilum components in heat-killed bacteria. However, an important role for active infection is demonstrated by the additional delay in apoptosis with intracellular growth and the refractory abrogation of this response by the p38 MAPK inhibitor 3 to 6 h after neutrophil infection. These results suggest that the initial activation of the p38 MAPK pathway leading to A. phagocytophilum-delayed neutrophil apoptosis is bypassed with active intracellular infection. Moreover, active intracellular infection contributes more to the overall delay in apoptosis than do components of heat-killed A. phagocytophilum alone.","['Choi, Kyoung-Seong', 'Park, Joon Tae', 'Dumler, J Stephen']","['Choi KS', 'Park JT', 'Dumler JS']","['Division of Medical Microbiology, Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 720 Rutland Avenue, Ross 624, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. sdumler@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,IM,"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/*microbiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['73/12/8209 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.73.12.8209-8218.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 2005 Dec;73(12):8209-18. doi: 10.1128/IAI.73.12.8209-8218.2005.,"['R01 AI041213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI41213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,PMC1307085,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed factors predicting a successful tumor harvest from bone marrow biopsies (BMBx) in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 9663 were reviewed. Bone marrow biopsies were obtained from 184 patients who underwent an office-based, unguided bone marrow biopsy of the posterior iliac crest. RESULTS: Forty-seven of the 184 patients (25.5%) had a positive bone marrow biopsy. When considered in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, lower hemoglobin levels, higher alkaline phosphatase, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated with a higher likelihood of a positive BMBx. The median survival time was 11 months (95% confidence interval, 8.0-14) among patients with a positive BMBx compared with 23 months (95% confidence interval, 19-27) with a negative BMBx. The median time to progression and time to prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival were also significantly decreased among positive BMBx patients. No patients with a positive BMBx survived beyond 3 years, whereas 11 of the 137 patients with a negative BMBx survived beyond 5 years. DISCUSSION: Using common laboratory values, a specific patient cohort can be defined from whom the yield of a nonguided BMBx would be high enough to justify this approach. For studies that require broader entry criteria, a more directed approach with image guidance is recommended.","['Ross, Robert W', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Ou, San-San', 'Rajeshkumar, Barur R', 'Woda, Bruce A', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Small, Eric J', 'Taplin, Mary-Ellen', 'Kantoff, Philip W']","['Ross RW', 'Halabi S', 'Ou SS', 'Rajeshkumar BR', 'Woda BA', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Small EJ', 'Taplin ME', 'Kantoff PW']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. rwross@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Bone Neoplasms/secondary', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Orchiectomy', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/02/14 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/22/8109 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1250 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 15;11(22):8109-13. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1250.,"['T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA78967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-six patients were enrolled in three strata: children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adults with ALL, and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aminopterin was given weekly, in two doses of 2 mg/m(2), 12 hours apart. Limited sampling pharmacokinetic analysis was done during the first week of therapy. Accumulation of [(3)H]aminopterin and [(3)H]methotrexate by leukemic blasts was studied in vitro. RESULTS: Six of 22 children with ALL (27%; 95% confidence interval, 8-47%) had clinically significant responses. None of those with AML and only two of 11 adults with ALL had responses meeting protocol definitions, although peripheral blast counts tended to decrease with therapy in all groups. Mucosal toxicity was minimal, even with limited use of leucovorin rescue. Complete bioavailability of aminopterin was confirmed, with a mean area under the curve of 0.52 +/- 0.03 micromol hour/L after oral dosing. No relationship between aminopterin pharmacokinetics and response was seen. In vitro, aminopterin showed more consistent metabolism by leukemic blasts to polyglutamates than methotrexate. Lineage-specific differences in the pattern of intracellular antifolylpolyglutamates were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly oral aminopterin has significant activity among children with refractory ALL. With greater cellular accumulation and metabolism, more reliable bioavailability than methotrexate, and tolerable toxicity at this dose and schedule, aminopterin deserves further study as a potent alternative to methotrexate.","['Cole, Peter D', 'Drachtman, Richard A', 'Smith, Angela K', 'Cate, Sarah', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Hawkins, Douglas S', 'Holcenberg, John', 'Kelly, Kara', 'Kamen, Barton A']","['Cole PD', 'Drachtman RA', 'Smith AK', 'Cate S', 'Larson RA', 'Hawkins DS', 'Holcenberg J', 'Kelly K', 'Kamen BA']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901, USA. colepd@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminopterin/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/ethnology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/02/14 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/22/8089 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0355 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 15;11(22):8089-96. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0355.,['FD-R-001832-03/FD/FDA HHS/United States'],"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)']",,,PMC2906753,['NIHMS214970'],,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To contribute the first incidence risk estimates for haematopoietic malignancies in relation to work history, procedures, practices, and protective measures in a large population of mostly female medical radiation workers. METHODS: The investigators followed up 71,894 (77.9% female) US radiologic technologists, first certified during 1926-80, from completion of a baseline questionnaire (1983-89) to return of a second questionnaire (1994-98), diagnosis of a first cancer, death, or 31 August 1998 (731,306 person-years), whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute risks. RESULTS: Relative risks (RR) for leukaemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (non-CLL, 41 cases) were increased among technologists working five or more years before 1950 (RR = 6.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 41.9, based on seven cases) or holding patients 50 or more times for x ray examination (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.4). Risks of non-CLL leukaemias were not significantly related to the number of years subjects worked in more recent periods, the year or age first worked, the total years worked, specific procedures or equipment used, or personal radiotherapy. Working as a radiologic technologist was not significantly linked with risk of multiple myeloma (28 cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (118 cases), Hodgkin's lymphoma (31 cases), or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (23 cases). CONCLUSION: Similar to results for single acute dose and fractionated high dose radiation exposures, there was increased risk for non-CLL leukaemias decades after initial protracted radiation exposure that likely cumulated to low-to-moderate doses.","['Linet, M S', 'Freedman, D M', 'Mohan, A K', 'Doody, M M', 'Ron, E', 'Mabuchi, K', 'Alexander, B H', 'Sigurdson, A', 'Hauptmann, M']","['Linet MS', 'Freedman DM', 'Mohan AK', 'Doody MM', 'Ron E', 'Mabuchi K', 'Alexander BH', 'Sigurdson A', 'Hauptmann M']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. linetm@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', '*Personnel, Hospital', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors', '*Technology, Radiologic', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Workforce']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['62/12/861 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2005.020826 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2005 Dec;62(12):861-7. doi: 10.1136/oem.2005.020826.,"['N01-CP-15673/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-51016/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-81005/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-81121/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1740936,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors added seven years of follow up to a previous investigation of mortality among 17 924 men employed in the North American synthetic rubber industry. Analyses used the standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare styrene-butadiene rubber workers' cause specific mortality (1943-98) with those of the United States and the Ontario general populations. RESULTS: Overall, the observed/expected numbers of deaths were 6237/7242 for all causes (SMR = 86, 95% CI 84 to 88) and 1608/1741 for all cancers combined (SMR = 92, 95% CI 88 to 97), 71/61 for leukaemia, 53/53 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 26/27 for multiple myeloma. The 16% leukaemia increase was concentrated in hourly paid subjects with 20-29 years since hire and 10 or more years of employment in the industry (19/7.4, SMR = 258, 95% CI 156 to 403) and in subjects employed in polymerisation (18/8.8, SMR = 204, 95% CI 121 to 322), maintenance labour (15/7.4, SMR = 326, 95% CI 178 to 456), and laboratory operations (14/4.3, SMR = 326, 95% CI 178-546). CONCLUSION: The study found that some subgroups of synthetic rubber workers had an excess of mortality from leukaemia that was not limited to a particular form of leukaemia. Uncertainty remains about the specific agent(s) that might be responsible for the observed excesses and about the role of unidentified confounding factors. The study did not find any clear relation between employment in the industry and other forms of lymphohaematopoietic cancer. Some subgroups of subjects had more than expected deaths from colorectal and prostate cancers. These increases did not appear to be related to occupational exposure in the industry.","['Sathiakumar, N', 'Graff, J', 'Macaluso, M', 'Maldonado, G', 'Matthews, R', 'Delzell, E']","['Sathiakumar N', 'Graff J', 'Macaluso M', 'Maldonado G', 'Matthews R', 'Delzell E']","['Department of Epidemiology, Ryals School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA. nalini@uab.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Butadienes', '*Chemical Industry', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality', 'Employment', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupations', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', '*Rubber', 'Styrene', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['62/12/822 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2004.018176 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2005 Dec;62(12):822-9. doi: 10.1136/oem.2004.018176.,,"['0 (Butadienes)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)']",['Occup Environ Med. 2006 Mar;63(3):157-8.

We have used the Friend retrovirus mouse model to demonstrate that immunostimulatory B-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) have a protective effect against retrovirus-induced suppression of antibody responses to potent B-cell antigens. CD8+ T cells were critical for effective treatment with CpG-ODN, since in vivo depletion of these cells from treated mice impaired protection from retrovirus-induced immunosuppression. Protection also required IFN-gamma, as neutralization of this cytokine abolished the therapeutic effect of CpG-ODN. These findings may have implications for the treatment of immunosuppressive virus infections.","['Kraft, Anke R M', 'Arndt, Tanja', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Kraft ARM', 'Arndt T', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Dittmer U']","['Institut fur Virologie des Universitatsklinikums Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122 Essen, Germany.', 'Institut fur Virologie des Universitatsklinikums Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122 Essen, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT, USA.', 'Institut fur Virologie des Universitatsklinikums Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122 Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage', 'Animals', '*Antibody Formation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interferon-gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2005/12/21 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.81115-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2005 Dec;86(Pt 12):3365-3368. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.81115-0.,,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.81115-0 [doi],,,,,

Despite the patient's partial response following imatinib therapy, all Ph(-) bone marrow metaphases persistently had the 3 additional chromosomal changes. Moreover, stimulated peripheral B-lymphocytes from the patient also showed the same chromosomal changes, suggesting that we had found a complex constitutional chromosome aberration unrelated to the leukemia. Peripheral blood karyotype analyses of 6 of the 7 closest relatives from 3 generations demonstrated at least 1 of these aberrations, although in different combinations. Standard bone marrow or peripheral blood karyotyping of hematologic disorders may uncover otherwise symptomless, unrelated constitutional changes together with disease-specific chromosome aberrations.A triple constitutional chromosome aberration combined with a hematologic disorder has not been described until now. In addition, multiple constitutional aberrations persisting through at least 3 generations seem to be extremely rare.

In the present paper, we report on the case of a 51-year-old woman with CML who experienced hepatic injury with severe hyperbilirubinemia caused by imatinib mesylate. The findings from a liver biopsy specimen and her clinical course suggested the hepatic injury to presumably have been caused by an allergic mechanism. The co-administration of prednisolone was thus tried, and she has been able to continue imatinib mesylate administration without any liver dysfunction and finally was able to obtain a complete cytogenetic response.We therefore recommend that prednisolone should be tried when severe hepatic injury caused by imatinib mesylate is observed, since it might enable such patients to continue imatinib mesylate treatment and thereby improve the prognosis in such cases.","['Ikuta, Katsuya', 'Torimoto, Yoshihiro', 'Jimbo, Junko', 'Inamura, Junki', 'Shindo, Motohiro', 'Sato, Kazuya', 'Tokusashi, Yoshihiko', 'Miyokawa, Naoyuki', 'Kohgo, Yutaka']","['Ikuta K', 'Torimoto Y', 'Jimbo J', 'Inamura J', 'Shindo M', 'Sato K', 'Tokusashi Y', 'Miyokawa N', 'Kohgo Y']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Asahikawa Medical College, Japan. ikuta@asahikawa-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Biopsy', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects/*pathology', 'Liver Diseases/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['C8EE1CRAAVM58N3Q [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.05034 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Nov;82(4):343-6. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.05034.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with imatinib mesylate (imatinib) alone rapidly normalized these parameters in parallel with a decrease in the number of blast cells. The treatment also maintained the patient in good condition for approximately 3 months, even though the number of blast cells, serum calcium level, serum PTHrP level, and PTHrP mRNA level increased at the terminal stage. Mutations of the p53, K-Ras, and BCR-ABL genes in PBMNC at BP were absent. A noteworthy feature in this patient was that PBMNC at BP but not at CP showed high Lyn mRNA expression.

Cleavage by gamma-secretase releases the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 (ICN1), permitting it to translocate to the nucleus and form a short-lived transcriptional activation complex that is essential for normal T-cell development. Two types of mutations are prevalent in human T-ALL: extracellular domain mutations that increase ICN1 production and C-terminal mutations that sustain ICN1 action. Inhibitors of ICN1 production and activity abrogate the growth of established T-ALL cell lines, and a clinical trial of a NOTCH pathway inhibitor in patients with refractory T-ALL has opened recently. These insights raise a number of new questions relevant to T-ALL pathogenesis and offer exciting opportunities for rational targeted therapy.","['Aster, Jon C']",['Aster JC'],"[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA. jaster@rics.bwh.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology']",74,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['8UR0D6QR640HKC8Y [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.05096 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Nov;82(4):295-301. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.05096.,,"['0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we attempted to investigate the mechanism of EPA-induced apoptosis. A rapid and sustained increase in calcium was observed in mitochondria at 2 h after the addition of EPA prior to apoptosis. Coincidently, hydroperoxide was generated in the mitochondria after exposure to EPA. Production of mitochondrial hydroperoxide was significantly reduced by ruthenium red, an inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and BAPTA-AM, a cytoplasmic calcium chelator, indicating that generation of hydroperoxide is triggered by an accumulation of calcium in the mitochondria. The production of mitochondrial hydroperoxide was markedly attenuated by overexpression of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) in the mitochondria. Apoptosis was therefore, significantly prevented through inhibition of mitochondrial hydroperoxide generation with mitochondrial PHGPx, ruthenium red or BAPTA-AM. However, accumulation of calcium in the mitochondria was not prevented by mitochondrial PHGPx although apoptosis was blocked, indicating that elevated calcium does not directly induce apoptosis. Taken together, our results show that calcium-dependent hydroperoxide accumulation in the mitochondria is critical in EPA-induced apoptosis.","['Koumura, Tomoko', 'Nakamura, Chika', 'Nakagawa, Yasuhito']","['Koumura T', 'Nakamura C', 'Nakagawa Y']","['Kitasato University, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 5-9-1 Shirokane, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics/metabolism', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Rats', 'Ruthenium Red/pharmacology']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['K18004V371K0865K [pii]', '10.1080/10715760500264654 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2005 Oct;39(10):1083-9. doi: 10.1080/10715760500264654.,,"['11103-72-3 (Ruthenium Red)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.12 (Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.","['Le Clech, Mikael', 'Chalhoub, Elias', 'Dohet, Christiane', 'Roure, Virginie', 'Fichelson, Serge', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise', 'Mathieu, Daniele']","['Le Clech M', 'Chalhoub E', 'Dohet C', 'Roure V', 'Fichelson S', 'Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Mathieu D']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire-UMR5535-IFR22, CNRS 1919 Route de Mende F-34980 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Response Elements', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(05)01302-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2005.10.055 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2006 Jan 6;355(1):9-19. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.10.055.

We have exploited this to engineer a specific posttranslational modification of a ""nonenvelope,"" virally associated protein. The bacterial biotin ligase (BirA) and a modified human DeltaLNGFR have been introduced into HEK293T cells and their protein products directed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The BirA then couples biotin to an acceptor peptide that has been fused to the DeltaLNGFR. This results in the covalent linkage of biotin to the extracellular domain of the DeltaLNGFR expressed on the cell surface. Lentiviral vectors from these cells are metabolically labeled with biotin in the presence of free biotin. These biotinylated lentiviral vectors have a high affinity for streptavidin paramagnetic particles and, once captured, are easily manipulated in vitro. This is illustrated by the concentration of lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with either the VSV-G or an amphotropic envelope in excess of 4500-fold.

By applying DNA probes (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA), the deletion in 11q22-23, 13q14, 13q34, and 17p13, and trisomy 12 were examined. With FISH, molecular cytogenetic aberration was detected in 10 of 16 patients [63%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 39-86], whereas with conventional cytogenetic test, chromosomal aberration was detected only in 2 out of 13 cases (15%, 95% CI 0-35). In total, the cases with one or more chromosomal aberrations were 11 out of 16 cases (69%, 95% CI 46-92). The most frequently detected aberration was the 13q14 deletion (69%, 95% CI 44-94), followed by trisomy 12 (19%, 95% CI 0-38) and 11q22 deletion (14%, 95% CI 0-33). No deletion in 17p13 was observed.

In both suspension and adherent cells, addition of the type 1/2A phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, during activation of CRAC uptake, resulted in a fall in [Ca(2+)](i) to near preactivation levels. Pre-treatment with calyculin A abolished the component of the Ca(2+) rise associated with activation of CRAC uptake and inhibited Mn(2+) entry, consistent with a requirement of phosphatase activity for activation of the pathway. Depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores is accompanied by a large depolarisation which is absolutely dependent upon Ca(2+) entry via the CRAC uptake pathway. Application of calyculin A or okadaic acid, a structurally unrelated phosphatase antagonist inhibits this depolarisation. Taken in concert, these data demonstrate a marked sensitivity of the CRAC entry pathway to inhibition by calyculin A and okadaic acid.","['Evans, Nicholas E', 'Forth, Mark K L', 'Simpson, Anna K', 'Mason, Michael J']","['Evans NE', 'Forth MK', 'Simpson AK', 'Mason MJ']","['Department of Physiology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EG, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Boron Compounds/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Ion Transport/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Manganese/metabolism', 'Marine Toxins', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Okadaic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Rats', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology']",,2005/11/22 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(05)00331-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamem.2005.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 Dec 10;1718(1-2):32-43. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamem.2005.10.005.

Anthracy cline-cytosine arabinoside (Ara C) intensive chemotherapy yields a complete remission in 50 percent (%) to 80% of newly diagnosed APL patients. Failure to achieve complete remission results in fatal bleeding due to coagulopathy or fatal sepsis during the phase of aplasia. It has been recently shown that all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) selectively differentiates abnormal promyelocytes into mature granulocytes in APL, both in vitro and in vivo, and induced complete remission in 80% to 90% of the newly diagnosed patients. It has also been observed that therapy with ATRA rapidly improved coagulopathy, and induced no aplasia. However, in 30% of patients the treatment with ATRA as a single drug was associated with rapid increase in leukocytes and signs of ""ATRA syndrome"", which could have fatal outcome. Therefore the European study group initiated in 1991 a multicentre randomised trial comparing chemotherapy with daunorubicin Ara C (chemotherapy group) and ATRA combined to the same chemotherapy (ATRA group) in newly diagnosed APL patients, aged 65 years or less. Results of this study strongly suggest that ATRA should be incorporated in the front line therapy of newly diagnosed APL. The aim of our study was to confirm their results in our newly diagnosed patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study we had 15 subsequently hospitalised patients with APL in whom diagnosis was made according to MIC classification, and who were treated with ATRA (Vesanoid-Hoffman La Roche) combined with chemotherapy according to the recommendation of the European study groups. The comparison of the effect of ATRA we has evaluated by the outcome of APL in 12 patients who received only combined chemotherapy in induction phase according to the Yu-AML-89 protocol 12 or 01-AM-86 protocol. Both protocols include daunorubicin and Ara C. In all patients MIC classification was performed. Characteristics of the patients included in the study with special emphasis to symptoms at presentation, are given in Table 1. TREATMENT: Patients treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy received daily oral dose of ATRA 45 mg/m2 until the complete remission, or for a maximum of 90 days. After complete remission they received three courses of daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 for 3 days, and Ara C 200 mg/m2 for 7 days. However, course one was added to ATRA on day one of treatment of initial leukocyte counts were greater than 5 x 10(9)/L or rapidly started to increase to above 6 x 10(9)/L or more. Patients treated with chemotherapy received only in induction phase daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 for 4 days and Ara C 200 mg/m for 7 days as well as the intensive platelet support, heparin, fresh frozen plasma in those with bleeding. During the study haemostasis monitoring was performed in all patients. Complete remission was defined according to the criteria of the European study group. Early death was defined as a death during the therapy with ATRA or chemotherapy due to ""ATRA syndrome"", bleeding, aplasia, or resistant leukaemia. Statistical analysis was performed according to the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Relevant haematological and pathobiological characteristics at presentation are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that there were no significant characteristic differences at presentation between ATRA group and chemotherapy group. The effects of the treatment are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that complete remission was achieved in 87% of patients receiving ATRA combined with chemotherapy and only in 42% of patients who received combined chemotherapy. This difference is significant (p < 0.01). Duration of complete remission lasted for 14 months (median) in the patients receiving ATRA while only 5 months (median) in the patients who received combined chemotherapy. Fatal outcome in ATRA group occurred in 13% due to the ""ATRA syndrome"" and in 58% of the patients treated with combined chemotherapy due to bleeding. Table 4 shows four selected patients from ATRA group in whom complete remission was followed with disappearance of t (15;17), thus providint the evidence of the eradication of clonal abnormalities. It should be emphasised that 2 of 15 patients developed ATRA syndrome during the early phases of the treatment with a feature of cardiorespiratory distress. The therapy with steroid was unsuccessful. Nine of 13 patients in ATRA group had moderate side effects with no necessity to discontinue the therapy. DISCUSSION: Our clinical trial shows for the first time in our county a beneficial effect of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in newly diagnosed APL, thus comfirming the results of the European study group. The only flaw of in our study may come from the fact that the patients included in the study were not randomised and that for the comparison of the ATRA group were used previously treated patients with chemotherapy alone. However, we believe that this flaw has been overcome since uniform diagnostic procedure and particularly MIC classification were performed in all patients. In addition to that, all patients included in the trial were subjected to the analysis of haemostatic status as well as to precise biochemical studies, ECG and abdominal echography.

The cells of those organs were fractionated. After removing the nuclei and mitochondria the residue was subdivided by means of the cesium chloride gradient into smooth and rough microsomes. The chalones were investigated in supernatants from these two groups of microsomes. In the obtained supernatants, the levels of proteins, nucleic acids and glycoproteins were estimated. The protein composition was analysed by means of disc electrophoresis on polyacrylamide, and the antigenic relationship of these proteins with the serum ones was studied using immunoelectrophoresis. The biological value of the separated fractions was investigated by means of the mitosis inhibition test in mice. The experimental groups of these animals were injected intraperitoneally with different cellular subfractions without or with colcemide. The control groups were treated with colcemide only or with physiological solution of NaCl. The subcellular fractions were separated from the tissues of healthy cattle and of that affected with leukosis. It was found that a protein showing chalone activity appears in all cellular subfractions derived from the tissues of healthy animals; its highest concentration was found in the supernatants from rough microsomes of the spleen and from smooth microsomes of the lymph nodes. The antimitotic effect was observed at the concentration of 100-200 microg of protein in 0.1 ml. This effect seems to be connected with glycoproteins. In the supernatants from tissues of leukotic animals, there was observed a decrease of the antimitotic effect. A mixture of proteins was present in the supernatants, which was demonstrated by means of polyacrylamide electrophoresis. These proteins showed and antigenic relationship with the proteins of blood serum. This can be concluded from their precipitation with the sera against the bovine serum proteins in the immunoelectrophoresis test. The chalone of the spleen seems to be different from that of the lymph nodes. The experiment showed the occurrence of an antimitotic effect with the non-homologous proteins, i.e. the chalone from the liver inhibited the mitotic divisions of the cells of the spleen, thymus and lymph nodes in mice. In this experiment, a mixture of proteins was used.

MTX(R) ZR-75-1 cells are 250-fold resistant to methotrexate when grown in the presence of 1 microM folinic acid and 2,400-fold resistant in the presence of 1 microM folic acid. This drug resistant cell line also showed collateral sensitivity (10-fold) to trimetrexate (TMQ), when grown in the presence of folinic acid. Using fluoresceinated methotrexate (F-MTX), FACS analysis indicated that there is no intracellular accumulation of methotrexate into MTX(R) ZR-75-1 cells, as determined by competition of F-MTX and methotrexate binding to dihydrofolate reductase. These characteristics strongly indicate that the mechanism of resistance involved down regulation of the reduced-folate transporter. To investigate this further, the transport kinetics of parental and MTX(R) ZR-75-1 cells were examined. Although the V(max) for methotrexate transport in wild-type (WT) ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells was 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than that in the well characterized leukemia cell lines, such as L1210 and CCRF-CEM cells, kinetic analysis indicated that transport of methotrexate into WT ZR-75-1 cells involved a mechanism that was similar if not identical to the reduced folate transporter. In contrast, no specific uptake of methotrexate was detected in MTX(R) ZR-75-1cells. Furthermore, neither cell line expressed detectable levels of folate binding protein, a binding protein with high affinity for folic acid as well as for reduced folates and antifolates. These results indicate that the level of expression of the reduced-folate carrier may be an important factor in determining the sensitivity of breast cancer cells as well as leukemia cells to antifolate compounds.","['Dixon, K H', 'Trepel, J B', 'Eng, S C', 'Cowan, K H']","['Dixon KH', 'Trepel JB', 'Eng SC', 'Cowan KH']","['Building 10, Room 12N226, Medicine Branch and Clinical Pharmacology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Trimetrexate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin B Complex/pharmacology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/095535491820873687 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1991;3(12):357-65. doi: 10.3727/095535491820873687.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (fluoresceinated methotrexate)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The defects in their signaling that lead to unfavorable environment within the uterus may cause embryo implantation failure. The leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-11 (IL-11) as well as IL-12/IL-15/IL-18 system are regarded to be important signaling vectors. LIF plays an essential role in the preimplantation embryo development and the blastocyst implantation and its gene mutations in women contribute to the implantation failure and subsequent infertility. IL-11 signaling has been shown to be required for the uterine decidualization response as well as for the hatching and attachment of blastocysts. The IL-12/IL-15/IL-18 system interacts with endometrial leukocytes, particularly with NK cells, and influences directly the local angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. Differences in the levels of endometrial leukocytic subpopulations and in the patterns of intra-uterine cytokine concentrations that are observed between fertile and infertile women contribute to infertility probably by affecting the embryonic maternal dialogue during the implantation and early placentation period. Focusing on this cross talk promises to open new era in assisted reproduction techniques that will be based on diagnostics of missing signaling molecules and impairments of uterine receptivity as well as on therapeutic applications of individualized embryo culture and transfer media.","['Kralickova, M', 'Sima, P', 'Rokyta, Z']","['Kralickova M', 'Sima P', 'Rokyta Z']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia. milena5m@seznam.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Folia Microbiol (Praha),Folia microbiologica,0376757,IM,"['Cytokines/physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics/immunology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/immunology', 'Endometrium/immunology', 'Female', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Mutation', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction']",62,2005/11/22 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/22 09:00'],"['2005/11/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02931563 [doi]'],ppublish,Folia Microbiol (Praha). 2005;50(3):179-86. doi: 10.1007/BF02931563.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We designed this study to assess the utility of white blood cell (WBC) flags and histogram pattern generated by Advia-60 automated hematology analyzer in the recognition and categorization of acute leukemia. Data printouts of 31 newly diagnosed cases of acute leukemia, 22 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 9 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were reviewed. All cases of AML and ALL generated the WBC suspect blastflag M2 associated with two of the non blast suspectflags G1 and G2. Among the cases of AML, 95.5% of the WBC histogram patterns were definitive of the presence of abnormal cells and were indicative of the myeloid nature of cells. Only 44.4% of the histograms in the cases of ALL could be definitive of the presence of abnormal cells and 33.3% were indicative of their lymphoid nature. Significantly, 55.5% of the histograms in ALL were normal. The false positives for both AML and ALL were 10.5% when only WBC flagging was considered and were reduced to 0.05% when the flags were combined with histogram patterns for interpretation. Combined flagging and histogram recognition can be of aid in identifying cases of acute leukemia and the morphologist can then assess these samples further.

Clinical responses to VPA were recently observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Herein, the authors have described results of a clinical trial with VPA plus ATRA in 26 patients with poor-risk AML. METHODS: VPA (5-10 mg/kg starting dose) and ATRA (45 mg/m(2)) were administered orally. Low-dose AraC or hydroxyurea were permitted to control leukocytosis. Biologic activity of VPA was confirmed by serial analysis of HDAC2 protein levels in peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Nineteen of 26 patients completed at least 4 weeks of VPA/ATRA treatment; 7 patients were withdrawn prematurely because of rapidly progressive disease (n = 3) or unacceptable neurologic and cardiovascular toxicity (n = 4). Additional cytoreductive treatment was required in 58% of patients enrolled. Median treatment duration was 3 months. No patient achieved complete remission, one with de novo AML had a minor response, and two patients with secondary AML arising from myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) achieved a partial remission and clearance of PB blasts, respectively. The latter responses were accompanied by profound granulocytosis and erythrocytosis in both patients, reminiscent of the response pattern known from ATRA treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, cytogenetic analysis of isolated CD34(+) cells and granulocytes did not reveal terminal differentiation of leukemic blasts. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VPA/ATRA results in transient disease control in a subset of patients with AML that has evolved from a myeloproliferative disorder but not in patients with a primary or MDS-related AML.","['Bug, Gesine', 'Ritter, Markus', 'Wassmann, Barbara', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Heinzel, Thorsten', 'Schwarz, Kerstin', 'Romanski, Annette', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Kampfmann, Manuela', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Bug G', 'Ritter M', 'Wassmann B', 'Schoch C', 'Heinzel T', 'Schwarz K', 'Romanski A', 'Kramer OH', 'Kampfmann M', 'Hoelzer D', 'Neubauer A', 'Ruthardt M', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital, JW Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Valproic Acid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2005/11/19 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/11/19 09:00'],"['2005/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21589 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Dec 15;104(12):2717-25. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21589.,,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

This novel kinase was found to partner with the D-type cyclins and to possess pRb kinase activity in vitro and has since been understood to function solely as a pRb kinase in the regulation of the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. In the past 2 years, several independent studies in multiple cell types have indicated a novel role for cdk6 in differentiation. For example, cdk6 expression must be reduced to allow proper osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, forced cdk6 expression blocked differentiation of mouse erythroid leukemia cells and cdk6 expression in primary astrocytes favors the expression of progenitor cell markers. Since exit from the cell cycle is a necessary step in terminal differentiation, down-regulation of a mitogenic factor may be expected in this process, however it is surprising that this association has not been previously uncovered and that it is apparently not shared with cdk4, long understood to be a functional homolog of cdk6. The mechanism of cdk6 function in differentiation is not understood, but it may extend beyond the established role of cdk6 as a pRb kinase. As this story unfolds it will be important to discover if the function of cdk6 in differentiation is pRb-dependent or pRb-independent, since pRb has long been established as a key factor in initiating and maintaining cell cycle exit during differentiation.","['Grossel, Martha J', 'Hinds, Philip W']","['Grossel MJ', 'Hinds PW']","['Department of Biology, PO Box 5331, Connecticut College, 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06371, USA. mjgro@conncoll.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism']",50,2005/11/19 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2005/11/19 09:00'],"['2005/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20712 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2006 Feb 15;97(3):485-93. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20712.,"['CA 096527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 015302/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

We here show that the expression of the antiapoptotic gene A1 is specifically enhanced at the DN3/DN4 transition and in DP thymocytes that have been positively selected suggesting that A1 expression might be considered as a transcriptional signature of thymocytes that have received pre-TCR or TCR survival signal. Furthermore, we observed that A1-a overexpression in recombination activation gene 1-deficient mice transgenic for the major histocompatibillity complex class I-restricted F5 TCR enhances cell survival of DP thymocytes and permits accumulation of DP cells awaiting positive selection. However, A1-a overexpression has no effect on negative selection. Therefore, our results suggest that A1 plays a specialized role in allowing survival of DP thymocytes and that its role can be distinguished from that of Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and Bcl-2.","['Verschelde, C', 'Michonneau, D', 'Trescol-Biemont, M-C', 'Berberich, I', 'Schimpl, A', 'Bonnefoy-Berard, N']","['Verschelde C', 'Michonneau D', 'Trescol-Biemont MC', 'Berberich I', 'Schimpl A', 'Bonnefoy-Berard N']","['Laboratory of homeostasie lymphocytaire, INSERM U503, IFR Biosciences Lyon-Gerland, 21 avenue Tony Garnier, 69007 Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,2005/11/19 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2005/11/19 09:00'],"['2005/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['4401814 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4401814 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2006 Jul;13(7):1213-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401814.

With an incidence of up to 12% in all AML cases, the translocation t(8;21), forming the AML1-ETO fusion gene, is one of the most common genetic aberrations in AML. Experimental data have shown that AML1-ETO is not sufficient to induce leukemia by itself, but has to collaborate with other genetic alterations for leukemic transformation. These data are supported by observations in AML patients, who recurrently show activating mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 or c-KIT together with the AML1-ETO fusion gene. These findings might have clinical implications and provide a rationale to test RTK inhibitors in the treatment of patients with core binding factor AML and concurrent activating RTK mutations.","['Kuchenbauer, F', 'Feuring-Buske, M', 'Buske, C']","['Kuchenbauer F', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2005/11/19 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2005/11/19 09:00'],"['2005/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['2256 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.12.2256 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Dec;4(12):1716-8. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.12.2256.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genotyping of the TNF -308 (G-->A) and LT-a +252 (A-->G) polymorphisms in patients (n = 488) enrolled onto the German-Austrian-Swiss multicenter trial NHL-BFM 95 from April 1996 to January 2000 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA from tumor-free specimen. RESULTS: In patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL; n = 219, 211 eligible patients), patients carrying at least two variant alleles (high-producer haplotypes) had an increased risk of events: probability of event-free survival (pEFS) at 3 years was 81% (SE = 5%), compared with 91% (SE = 2%) in low-producer haplotypes (P = .018). In BL/B-ALL with high tumor load (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] > or = 500 U/L; n = 104), pEFS was 69% (SE = 8%) in high-producer versus 85% (SE = 4%) in low-producer haplotypes (P = .05). In multivariate analysis including risk factors for events (LDH > or = 500 U/L, CNS involvement, methotrexate infusion regimen), TNF -308/LT-alpha +252 haplotype kept prognostic relevance: patients with high-producer haplotypes had a 2.34-fold increase in risk of events (P = .048). The TNF -308 (G-->A) and LT-alpha +252 (A-->G) polymorphisms were not associated with pEFS in lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 101), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (n = 67), or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 65), nor with therapy-related toxicity. CONCLUSION: The TNF -308 (G-->A) and LT-a +252 (A-->G) polymorphisms were negative prognostic factors in pediatric BL/B-ALL.

The role of long-acting hematopoietic growth factors in facilitating every-2-week chemotherapy and minimizing hematologic toxicity has not been established. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with stage I to III breast cancer received dose-dense AC --> paclitaxel as neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients received pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneous (SQ) on day 2 of each cycle. Darbepoetin alfa was initiated at 200 microg SQ every 2 weeks for hemoglobin < or = 12 g/dL, and administered thereafter, according to a preplanned algorithm. The primary end points were to evaluate the percentage of patients with febrile neutropenia and the percentage of patients requiring RBC transfusion. RESULTS: Among 135 women treated on this single arm study, there were two cases of febrile neutropenia (incidence 1.5%). No patients received RBC transfusion. Darbepoetin alfa therapy was initiated in 92% of patients. The modest leukocytosis seen during paclitaxel cycles was attributable, in part, to corticosteroid premedication. Other toxicity and dose-delivery were similar to dose-dense AC --> paclitaxel in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9741.

New technologies are needed to elucidate the temporal patterns of immune responses and the spatial distribution of immune cells on a whole-body scale. We describe a noninvasive, quantitative, and tomographic approach to visualize a primary anti-tumor immune response by using positron emission tomography (PET). Bone marrow chimeric mice were generated by engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with a trifusion reporter gene encoding synthetic Renilla luciferase (hRluc), EGFP, and Herpes virus thymidine kinase (sr39TK). Mice were challenged with the Moloney murine sarcoma and leukemia virus complex (M-MSV/M-MuLV), and the induced immune response was monitored by using PET. Hematopoietic cells were visualized by using 9-[4-[(18)F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine ([(18)F]FHBG), a radioactive substrate specific for the sr39TK PET reporter protein. Immune cell localization and expansion were seen at the tumor and draining lymph nodes (DLNs). 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG), which is sequestered in metabolically active cells, was used to follow tumor growth and regression. Elevated glucose metabolism was also seen in activated lymphocytes in the DLNs by using the [(18)F]FDG probe. When M-MSV/M-MuLV-challenged mice were treated with the immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone, activation and expansion of immune cell populations in the DLNs could no longer be detected with PET imaging.

In vivo studies have shown that STAT5 contributes to prolactin-dependent lobuloalveolar development and lactation whereas STAT3 mediates LIF-dependent epithelial apoptosis during postlactational involution. To understand the molecular basis of these STAT-dependent pathways, we demonstrate the ligand-independent effects of STAT5 and STAT3 in mammary epithelial cells in vitro and also identify the genes regulated by these related transcription factors. Thus, using conditionally active STAT3- or STAT5a-GyraseB fusion proteins, we observed that enforced and specific dimerization of STAT3 induced apoptosis whereas STAT5 induced differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, STAT5 attenuated apoptosis mediated by LIF, the physiological inducer of STAT3. Microarray analysis of STAT3- and STAT5-induced genes using this system demonstrated a marked specificity, which reflected their different physiological effects in vitro and in vivo. STAT5-specific gene targets included the milk protein genes alpha-casein and kallikrein-8 and the survival factors prosaposin and Grb10. STAT3-specific genes included the apoptosis regulators CCAAT enhancer binding protein-delta, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulatory subunits, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and c-fos. These data illustrate that specific activation of STAT3 and STAT5 alone is sufficient to induce and suppress apoptosis, respectively, and that these transcription factors elicit their actions by inducing distinct subsets of target genes in mammary epithelial cells.","['Clarkson, Richard W E', 'Boland, Marion P', 'Kritikou, Ekaterini A', 'Lee, Jennifer M', 'Freeman, Tom C', 'Tiffen, Paul G', 'Watson, Christine J']","['Clarkson RW', 'Boland MP', 'Kritikou EA', 'Lee JM', 'Freeman TC', 'Tiffen PG', 'Watson CJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QP, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Gyrase/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology/*growth & development/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",,2005/11/19 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2005/11/19 09:00'],"['2005/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['me.2005-0392 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2005-0392 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2006 Mar;20(3):675-85. doi: 10.1210/me.2005-0392.

Overall, 40% of patients died of transplant-related mortality (TRM). Best hematologic response after SCT was complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) in 8 and 2 patients, respectively, leading to an organ response in 8 of these patients. Seven of the 10 patients in remission are long-term survivors. In 5 of 7 evaluable patients in CR, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was observed, indicating the contribution of immune effects to disease control. The main clinical problem was cardiac failure in patients with poor performance status due to amyloidosis or in combination with severe infections.

GCs mediate apoptosis via their cognate receptor and subsequent alterations in gene expression. Previous investigations, including expression profiling studies with subgenome microarrays in model systems, have led to a number of attractive, but conflicting, hypotheses that have never been tested in a clinical setting. Here, we present a comparative whole-genome expression profiling approach using lymphoblasts (purified at 3 time points) from 13 GC-sensitive children undergoing therapy for ALL. For comparisons, expression profiles were generated from an adult patient with ALL, peripheral blood lymphocytes from GC-exposed healthy donors, GC-sensitive and -resistant ALL cell lines, and mouse thymocytes treated with GCs in vivo and in vitro. This generated an essentially complete list of GC-regulated candidate genes in clinical settings and experimental systems, allowing immediate analysis of any gene for its potential significance to GC-induced apoptosis. Our analysis argued against most of the model-based hypotheses and instead identified a small number of novel candidate genes, including PFKFB2, a key regulator of glucose metabolism; ZBTB16, a putative transcription factor; and SNF1LK, a protein kinase implicated in cell-cycle regulation.","['Schmidt, Stefan', 'Rainer, Johannes', 'Riml, Stefan', 'Ploner, Christian', 'Jesacher, Simone', 'Achmuller, Clemens', 'Presul, Elisabeth', 'Skvortsov, Sergej', 'Crazzolara, Roman', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Raivio, Taneli', 'Janne, Olli A', 'Geley, Stephan', 'Meister, Bernhard', 'Kofler, Reinhard']","['Schmidt S', 'Rainer J', 'Riml S', 'Ploner C', 'Jesacher S', 'Achmuller C', 'Presul E', 'Skvortsov S', 'Crazzolara R', 'Fiegl M', 'Raivio T', 'Janne OA', 'Geley S', 'Meister B', 'Kofler R']","['Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, Innrain 66, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/11/19 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2005/11/19 09:00'],"['2005/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63907-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-07-2853 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Mar 1;107(5):2061-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-07-2853.

Activation of Chk1 in response to cytarabine (ara-C) induced an S-phase checkpoint characterized by the inhibition of Cdk2, cell cycle arrest, no change in constitutively active Akt, or low-stress kinase signaling in ML-1 cells. However, inhibition of Chk1 by UCN-01 in S-phase-arrested cells resulted in an abrogation of the checkpoint, inhibition of Akt, activation of JNK, and a rapid induction of apoptosis. Similarly, primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts exposed to ara-C and UCN-01 demonstrated a selective loss in cloning potential when compared with normal progenitors. Therefore, we evaluated a pilot clinical trial of ara-C in combination with UCN-01 in patients with relapsed AML. Blasts from some patients demonstrated a previously activated Chk1-Cdk2 DNA damage response pathway that decreased during therapy. Constitutively phosphorylated Akt kinase declined on addition of UCN-01 to the ara-C infusion, an action accompanied by an activation of JNK and reduction in absolute AML blast counts. Thus, use of UCN-01 in combination with ara-C decreases Chk1 phosphorylation, inhibits the Akt survival pathway, and activates JNK during the course of therapy, offering a rationale for the cytotoxic action of this combination during AML treatment.","['Sampath, Deepa', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Du, Min', 'Shi, Zheng', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William']","['Sampath D', 'Cortes J', 'Estrov Z', 'Du M', 'Shi Z', 'Andreeff M', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

In patients, the infusion of TK+ lymphocytes and the subsequent administration of GCV resulted in a time-wise modulation of antihost reactivity for a GvL effect, while controlling GvHD. Because activation required for genetic modification with RV may reduce antihost reactivity, we investigated the requirements for maximizing the potency of human TK+ lymphocytes. Whereas T-cell receptor triggering alone led to effector memory (EM) TK+ lymphocytes, the addition of CD28 costimulation through cell-sized beads resulted in the generation of central memory (CM) TK+ lymphocytes. In a quantitative model for GvHD using nonobese diabetic/severely combined immunodeficient mice, CM TK+ lymphocytes were more potent than EM TK+ lymphocytes.

Here, we report that in BCR/ABL+ cell lines and in patient-derived CML blast crisis mononuclear and CD34+ cells, p210(BCR/ABL) increases expression and activity of the transcriptional-inducer and translational-regulator heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K or HNRPK) in a dose- and kinase-dependent manner through the activation of the MAPK(ERK1/2) pathway. Furthermore, HNRPK down-regulation and interference with HNRPK translation-but not transcription-regulatory activity impairs cytokine-independent proliferation, clonogenic potential, and in vivo leukemogenic activity of BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid 32Dcl3 and/or primary CD34+ CML-BC patient cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that decreased internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent Myc mRNA translation accounts for the phenotypic changes induced by inhibition of the BCR/ABL-ERK-dependent HNRPK translation-regulatory function. Accordingly, MYC protein but not mRNA levels are increased in the CD34+ fraction of patients with CML in accelerated and blastic phase but not in chronic phase CML patients and in the CD34+ fraction of marrow cells from healthy donors.

The change in conformation of drug molecule on binding to DNA, deoxyribose conformation and glycosidic bond rotation has been obtained. The absence of sequential NOE connectivities at d-T1pG2 and d-C5pA6 sites shows that the drug chromophore intercalates between these two base pairs.

A set of 17 intermolecular NOE interactions allowed the structure to be derived by restrained molecular dynamics simulations, which have been compared with that obtained by X-ray analysis. Several specific interactions between the drug and DNA protons are found to stabilize the formation of drug-DNA complex.","['Barthwal, Ritu', 'Sharma, Uma', 'Srivastava, Nandana', 'Jain, Monica', 'Awasthi, Pamita', 'Kaur, Manpreet', 'Barthwal, Sudhir Kumar', 'Govil, Girjesh']","['Barthwal R', 'Sharma U', 'Srivastava N', 'Jain M', 'Awasthi P', 'Kaur M', 'Barthwal SK', 'Govil G']","['Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247 667, India. ritubarthwal@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Daunorubicin/*chemistry/*metabolism', '*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protons']",,2005/11/19 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2005/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0223-5234(05)00239-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2005.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2006 Jan;41(1):27-39. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2005.09.005.

We report common biomarkers from this region that distinguish between normal and malignant tissues and cell lines. Based on our findings, we propose that the wavenumber region around 2800 to 3000 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectra of cells and tissues could provide valuable scientific evidence at the onset of premalignancy and may be used for ex vivo and in vitro detection of carcinogenesis.

Collimator angle and pedestal rotations are introduced to obtain coplanar alignment of the matched junction. Furthermore, daily moving junctions are commonly used to feather out the junctional dose as additional safeguards to avoid radiation myelopathy. Helical tomotherapy integrates linear accelerator and CT technology capable of delivering CSA treatment without geometric matches or feathering of junctions. The patient is treated with helical beams in the supine position. Since CSA is used mainly in the pediatric population, the potential increase in integral dose to structures or the whole body from linac- or tomotherapy-based IMRT raises concerns of increased rates of secondary malignancies. In this study, we will present an integral dose comparison between conventional CSA (3D) and helical delivery to the CSA (TOMO) utilizing the Tomotherapy Hi-ART system for three pediatric patients. Integral dose was calculated for organ at risk (OAR), two targets (PTV-BRAIN and PTV-SPINE), entire planning CT data set and to the healthy tissue (entire CT-DATA SET minus the PTV). Overall integral dose was 8% higher in the TOMO plans for Patients #1 and #3, but 2% lower in Patient #2. DVH analysis shows that TOMO plans give lower doses to larger volumes and higher doses to smaller volumes of tissue in all three cases. The advantages of the TOMO plans are minimization of matched junctions and better sparing of most OARs. With increased computational and memory power in the tomotherapy planning station, the excess integral dose to the healthy tissue can be re-distributed within the patient and in turn the total integral dose can be same or lower than in conventional delivery. The impact of a small increase in overall integral dose and the associated risks of secondary malignancies are unknown. Long-term follow-up is needed to answer this question.","['Penagaricano, Jose A', 'Shi, Chengyu', 'Ratanatharathorn, Vancerat']","['Penagaricano JA', 'Shi C', 'Ratanatharathorn V']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, 72205, USA.

Hox specificity is generally thought to be enhanced by the interaction with members of the TALE superclass of homeodomain proteins Pbx, Meis, and Prep. Using reverse transcription PCR with total human hair follicle RNA, we demonstrated transcripts of the major TALE proteins PBX1-4, MEIS1, 2 and PREP1, 2 in the human hair follicle. In view of the presence of MEIS/PREP responsive elements in close vicinity to the HOXC13 binding sites of the hHa5 and hHa2 promoters, we determined the expression sites of these TALE proteins in the human hair follicle. We found that MEIS1, MEIS2, PREP1 and PREP2 were differentially expressed in the three layers of the inner root sheath. In addition, MEIS2 and PREP1 exhibited expression in the mid-to upper hair cortex, with PREP1 being also expressed in the dermal papilla and the connective tissue sheath of the hair follicle. In virtually all cases, the expression of these TALE proteins was exclusively cytoplasmic. Considering that in contrast, HOXC13 is expressed in the nuclei of matrix, precortex and lower cuticle cells of the hair follicle, our data suggest that despite the presence of MEIS/PREP binding sites in the hHa5 and hHa2 promoters, the HOXC13-controlled activation of these genes in the hair follicle does not seem to involve these TALE proteins as cofactors.","['Jave-Suarez, Luis Felipe', 'Schweizer, Jurgen']","['Jave-Suarez LF', 'Schweizer J']","['Section of Normal and Neoplastic Epidermal Differentiation, German Cancer Research Center, A145, Im Neuenheimerfeld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hair Follicle/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Keratins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/genetics/physiology', 'RNA/analysis/genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00403-005-0623-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 2006 Feb;297(8):372-6. doi: 10.1007/s00403-005-0623-3.

Originally, the treatment rationale in hemoglobinopathies was to achieve demethylation of the hypermethylated and hence silent gamma-globin gene locus, thus reactivating synthesis of hemoglobin F (HbF). In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), cytogenetic analyses are mandatory for risk stratification and for monitoring response to drug treatment. The current knowledge regarding cytogenetic subgroups as predictors of response to low-dose decitabine in MDS as well as cytogenetic responses caused by demethylating agents is summarized in this review. Decitabine treatment is associated with a response rate that is higher in patients with high-risk cytogenetics (i.e., complex karyotype and/or abnormalities of chromosome 7) than in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (two abnormalities or single abnormalities excluding 5q-, 20q-, and -Y). Following decitabine treatment of patients with abnormal karyotype, approximately one-third achieve a major cytogenetic response that can be confirmed by FISH analyses, while in two-thirds of patients, the abnormal karyotype persists but hematologic improvement may be observed during continued treatment. The most frequently studied gene in myelodysplasia is the cell cycle regulator p15(INK4b). Hypermethylation of p15(INK4b) in MDS is reversed during treatment with decitabine, resulting in reactivation of this gene. In hemoglobinopathies, treatment with demethylating agents leads to reactivation of fetal HbF (the gamma-globin gene locus also possibly being another target for reactivation in MDS), and thus, HbF may potentially act as surrogate marker for activity of decitabine. Other, thus far unidentified hypermethylated genes may also be targets for demethylating agents.","['Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Robbel, Christian', 'Wijermans, Pierre', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Hackanson B', 'Robbel C', 'Wijermans P', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics']",32,2005/11/18 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0004-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Dec;84 Suppl 1:32-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0004-1.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal bendamustine dosing for CLL patients had not been finally established and a phase I/II study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of bendamustine. METHODS: The open-label, single-centre phase I/II study was conducted from March 2001 to September 2002 in Sofia, Bulgaria. The 15 study patients were extendedly pre-treated, but fludarabine-naive (3 female, 12 male, 47-72 years of age, 61 years on average). Bendamustine was given at a starting dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 every 3 weeks based on the previous results in lymphoma. RESULTS: Bendamustine was well tolerated in spite of heavy pre-treatment of the study participants. Toxicity corresponded to the known safety profile of bendamustine, with the exception of bilirubin elevation. The level of 110 mg/m2 was established as MTD. A bendamustine dose of 100 mg/m2 is the recommended dose for further clinical investigations. A 4-week interval is recommended to allow for sufficient recovery. Efficacy results confirmed powerful anti-neoplastic activity of bendamustine even in extendedly pre-treated CLL patients. Based on the remission criteria, nine patients were defined as responders (four CRs, two PR, three NC) and two patients as nonresponders to therapy. Four patients were not evaluable for response, because they had received less than three courses bendamustine. After a follow-up period of 15 months, the four patients with CR were still in remission. One patient with PR had relapsed, the other had ongoing response. CONCLUSIONS: Bendamustine is a very active and well-tolerated drug in patients with pre-treated and refractory CLL. Fludarabine-naivity of patients appears to markedly improve their bendamustine tolerability. First-line use of bendamustine is a safe option for CLL-patients requiring treatment, because bendamustine-owing to its unique pharmacodynamics-(1) is highly effective, (2) reasonably safe, and (3) does hardly produce cross-resistance against other anti-neoplastic drugs effective in this indication.","['Lissitchkov, T', 'Arnaudov, G', 'Peytchev, D', 'Merkle, Kh']","['Lissitchkov T', 'Arnaudov G', 'Peytchev D', 'Merkle Kh']","['National Center of Haematology and Transfusiology, 6 Plovdivsko Pole, 1746 Sofia, Bulgaria. tlissitchkov@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-005-0050-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb;132(2):99-104. doi: 10.1007/s00432-005-0050-z.

Novel therapies are needed to treat these patients. Leukemia cells are very sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (VELCADE(R), PS-341), which enhances the in vitro cytotoxic effects of dexamethasone and doxorubicin in multiple myeloma. To determine if bortezomib enhances the cytotoxicity of agents used in leukemia, we employed an in vitro tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT) to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib alone and in combination with dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, cytarabine, asparaginase, geldanamycin, trichostatin A, and the bcl-2 inhibitor HA14.1. We demonstrated that primary leukemia lymphoblasts and leukemia cell lines are sensitive to bortezomib, with an average IC(50) of 12 nM. Qualitative and quantitative bortezomib-drug interactions were evaluated using the universal response surface approach (URSA). Bortezomib was synergistic with dexamethasone in dexamethasone-sensitive leukemia cells, and additive with vincristine, asparaginase, cytarabine, and doxorubicin. The anti-leukemic activity of bortezomib was also additive with geldanamycin and HA14.1, and additive or synergistic with trichostatin A. These results were compared to analysis using the median-dose effect method, which generated complex drug interactions due to differences in dose-response curve sigmoidicities. These data suggest bortezomib could potentiate the cytotoxic effects of combination chemotherapy in patients with leukemia.","['Horton, Terzah M', 'Gannavarapu, Anurhadha', 'Blaney, Susan M', ""D'Argenio, David Z"", 'Plon, Sharon E', 'Berg, Stacey L']","['Horton TM', 'Gannavarapu A', 'Blaney SM', ""D'Argenio DZ"", 'Plon SE', 'Berg SL']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center/Baylor College of Medicine, 6621 Fannin, MC 3-3320, Houston, 77030, USA. tmhorton@txccc.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Interactions', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-005-0135-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2006 Jul;58(1):13-23. doi: 10.1007/s00280-005-0135-z.

Multiple and independent redundant nuclear localization signals encoded by HIV have been hypothesized to facilitate migration of viral genomes into the nucleus. The integrase (IN) protein of HIV is one of the HIV elements that targets to the nucleus; however, its role in nuclear entry of virus genomes has been difficult to describe because mutations in IN are pleiotropic. To investigate the importance of the HIV IN protein for infection of non-dividing cells, and to investigate whether or not IN was redundant with other viral signals for cell cycle-independent nuclear entry, we constructed an HIV-based chimeric virus in which the entire IN protein of HIV was replaced by that of MLV. This chimeric virus with a heterologous IN was infectious at a low level, and was able to integrate in an IN-dependent manner. Furthermore, this virus infected non-dividing cells as well as it infected dividing cells. Moreover, we used the chimeric HIV with MLV IN to further eliminate all of the other described nuclear localization signals from an HIV genome--matrix, IN, Viral Protein R, and the central polypurine tract--and show that no combination of the virally encoded NLS is essential for the ability of HIV to infect non-dividing cells.","['Yamashita, Masahiro', 'Emerman, Michael']","['Yamashita M', 'Emerman M']","['Division of Human Biology and Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/virology', 'Chimera', 'Gene Products, vpr/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV/*physiology', 'HIV Integrase/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/metabolism', 'Organisms, Genetically Modified', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication', 'vpr Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/07/13 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.0010018 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2005 Nov;1(3):e18. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.0010018.

However, the mechanisms underlying astrocyte specification are poorly understood. It is well established that cellular diversification of neurons in the embryo is generated by position-dependent extrinsic signals and combinatorial interactions of transcription factors that direct specific cell fates by suppressing alternative fates. It is unknown whether a comparable process determines embryonic astrocyte identity. Indeed, astrocyte development is generally thought to take place in a position-independent manner. Here we show multiple functions of Stem cell leukaemia (Scl, also known as Tal1), which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, in the regulation of both astrocyte versus oligodendrocyte cell fate acquisition and V2b versus V2a interneuron cell fate acquisition in the p2 domain of the developing vertebrate spinal cord. Our findings demonstrate a regionally restricted transcriptional programme necessary for astrocyte and V2b interneuron development, with striking parallels to the involvement of SCL in haematopoiesis. They further indicate that acquisition of embryonic glial subtype identity might be regulated by genetic interactions between SCL and the transcription factor Olig2 in the ventral neural tube.","['Muroyama, Yuko', 'Fujiwara, Yuko', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Rowitch, David H']","['Muroyama Y', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Orkin SH', 'Rowitch DH']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Interneurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Motor Neurons/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature04139 [pii]', '10.1038/nature04139 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2005 Nov 17;438(7066):360-3. doi: 10.1038/nature04139.,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Olig2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, required for its transformation ability. Although the molecular mechanisms behind this malignancy are not fully understood, a role for phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase has been repeatedly described. Here we report the specific up-regulation of the class I(B) catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (p110gamma) in response to BCR-ABL expression. We demonstrate that this upregulation is due to increased transcription and is dependent on both PI 3-kinase and MEK activity. We performed in vitro kinase activity assays and show that BCR-ABL also leads to increased p110gamma activity and that this activation requires both G protein-coupled receptor and Ras signaling. In addition, by transfection of cells with dominant negative p110gamma, we determined that this specific PI 3-kinase isoform is involved in both proliferation and the apoptosis resistance associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. The data presented here define for the first time the ability of BCR-ABL to alter the expression levels of PI 3-kinase isoforms and also demonstrate a previously unreported link between BCR-ABL and p110gamma.","['Hickey, Fionnuala B', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Hickey FB', 'Cotter TG']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)70663-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M511173200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Feb 3;281(5):2441-50. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M511173200.

Induction of DNA replication by LIF or prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) occurs, in part, through different signaling events. LIF and OSM specifically trigger STAT1 cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation, whereas PGF2alpha fails to do so. However, LIF and PGF2alpha can trigger increases in ERK1/2 activity, which are required for their mitogenic responses because U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, prevents both ERK1/2 activation and induction of DNA synthesis by LIF or PGF2alpha treatment. PGF2alpha induces cyclin D expression and full phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. In contrast, LIF fails to promote increases in cyclin D mRNA/protein levels; consequently, LIF induces DNA synthesis without promoting full phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). However, both LIF and PGF2alpha increase cyclin E expression. Furthermore, LIF mitogenic action does not involve protein kinase C (PKC) activation, because a PKC inhibitor does not block this effect. In contrast, PKC activity is required for PGF2alpha mitogenic action. More importantly, the synergistic effect between LIF and PGF2alpha to promote S phase entry is independent of PKC activation. These results show fundamental differences between LIF- and PGF2alpha-dependent mechanism(s) that induce cellular entry into S phase. These findings are critical in understanding how LIF and other related cytokine-regulated events participate in normal cell cycle control and may also provide clues to unravel crucial processes underlying cancerous cell division.","['Dekanty, Andres', 'Sauane, Moira', 'Cadenas, Belen', 'Coluccio, Federico', 'Barrio, Marcela', 'Casala, Jorgelina', 'Paciencia, Mercedes', 'Rogers, Florencia', 'Coso, Omar A', 'Piwien-Pilipuk, Graciela', 'Rudland, Philip S', 'de Asua, Luis Jimenez']","['Dekanty A', 'Sauane M', 'Cadenas B', 'Coluccio F', 'Barrio M', 'Casala J', 'Paciencia M', 'Rogers F', 'Coso OA', 'Piwien-Pilipuk G', 'Rudland PS', 'de Asua LJ']","['Fundacion Instituto Leloir, Av.

While imatinib has been extremely effective for chronic phase CML, blast crisis CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often resistant.

Adaphostin is a tyrphostin that was originally intended to inhibit the BCR/ABL kinase by competing with its peptide substrates. Recent findings have in addition implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytotoxic mechanism of adaphostin. In view of this unique mode of action, we examined the effects of adaphostin on numerous imatinib-resistant leukemia models, including imatinib-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL cell lines, cells harboring point mutations in BCR/ABL, and specimens from imatinib-resistant CML patients, using assays for intracellular ROS, apoptosis, and clonogenicity.

STUDY DESIGN: Low-dose (1 microg) adrenocorticotropic hormone tests were performed before and after steroid courses and during infectious episodes in 24 children. Test results were not available during the study. RESULTS: All 13 patients tested before treatment had normal adrenal responses. Adrenal suppression was found in 8 (47%) of 17 patients 5 days after discontinuation of a 5-week induction course of prednisolone and in 1 (20%) of 5 patients 7 days after a 3-week intensification course of dexamethasone, both courses being tapered over 9 days, as well as in all 13 patients tested 2 days after a 1-week prednisolone course. Clinically significant manifestations of adrenal suppression were noted in 3 (12%) patients. Of 204 scheduled tests, 131 were performed. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose glucocorticoid therapy may cause adrenal suppression lasting more than 1 week in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, even after tapering the dose. We suggest steroid replacement during stress episodes within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation and thereafter testing adrenal function selectively in accordance with symptoms.","['Rix, Mariane', 'Birkebaek, Niels Holtum', 'Rosthoj, Steen', 'Clausen, Niels']","['Rix M', 'Birkebaek NH', 'Rosthoj S', 'Clausen N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Function Tests', 'Adrenal Insufficiency/*chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Infant', 'Infections/blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Observation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2004/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)00503-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 2005 Nov;147(5):645-50. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.06.006.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to document the prevalence of left ventricular myocardial mass (LVM) reduction and its possible association with plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in asymptomatic children treated with anthracyclines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen asymptomatic children who had received anthracyclines during their treatment for cancer were evaluated. They had received an equivalent of doxorubicin dose 240 mg/m2 (22-1200 mg/m2) on average 3.9 years (0.6-8.3) before (median age at diagnosis 3.8 years). The LVM was determined by M-Mode echocardiography and compared to the expected value, obtained from the regression equation of LVM on height of a group of 160 healthy children. Additionally the patients' plasma NT-pro BNP levels were determined. RESULTS: A high prevalence of reduced LVM associated with increased NT-proBNP levels was found. The average LVM value was -14.4% (+/-4.9) lower than expected whereas fourteen patients (73%) had a lower LVM than predicted. The NT-pro BNP levels in patients with reduced LVM were significantly higher than those measured in patients without LVM reduction (0.316+/-0.02 versus 0.17+/-0.01 pmol/ml respectively, p=0.009). A cut off NT-pro BNP level of 0.2 pmol/ml could differentiate patients with LVM reduction from those with normal or greater than expected LVM. CONCLUSION: The association of higher NT-proBNP levels with reduced LVM in asymptomatic children after anthracycline administration could be an early indication of subclinical cardiotoxicity.","['Germanakis, Ioannis', 'Kalmanti, Maria', 'Parthenakis, Frangiskos', 'Nikitovic, Dragana', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Patrianakos, Alexander', 'Vardas, Panos E']","['Germanakis I', 'Kalmanti M', 'Parthenakis F', 'Nikitovic D', 'Stiakaki E', 'Patrianakos A', 'Vardas PE']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Cardiol,International journal of cardiology,8200291,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Heart Ventricles/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-5273(05)00713-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cardiol. 2006 Apr 4;108(2):212-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.05.006.

At the moment, new drugs blocking some cell functions, such as monoclonal antibodies or tyrosin kinase inhibitors are available for many oncologists, but their efficacy should be debated for several reasons. Despite having a strong biological and preclinical rationale, the clinical results of these agents are not comparable to the results obtained by imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumour or in chronic myeloid leukaemia even though superior to chemotherapy alone. Moreover, the efficacy does not show any correlation with the molecular expressions of the tumours.

Previous studies have indicated that the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor prevents the cytotoxic effects of interferon-gamma on oligodendrocytes in vitro, and the death of oligodendrocytes in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Members of a recently characterized family of proteins, the suppressors of cytokine signaling, have been demonstrated to mediate negative cross-talk between cytokines, with induction of suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins by one cytokine inhibiting the activity of a second. Here, we assess whether induction of members of the suppressors of cytokine signaling family could explain the antagonistic biological effects of leukemia inhibitory factor and interferon-gamma upon oligodendrocytes. It is found that leukemia inhibitory factor rapidly and strongly induces the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 in cultured rat oligodendrocytes, whereas interferon-gamma weakly induces the expression of both suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 and 3. Pre-treatment of oligodendrocytes with leukemia inhibitory factor does not prevent the subsequent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 by interferon-gamma indicating that the leukemia inhibitory factor inhibition of interferon-gamma toxicity in oligodendrocytes is mediated by a suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 independent mechanism.","['Emery, B', 'Butzkueven, H', 'Snell, C', 'Binder, M', 'Kilpatrick, T J']","['Emery B', 'Butzkueven H', 'Snell C', 'Binder M', 'Kilpatrick TJ']","['Multiple Sclerosis Group, The Howard Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Death/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Interactions/immunology', 'Feedback, Physiological/physiology', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/*toxicity', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Multiple Sclerosis/immunology/physiopathology', 'Oligodendroglia/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-4522(05)01077-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.09.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2006;137(2):463-72. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.09.022.

Our study aimed at designing a liposomal imatinib formulation and investigating molecular interactions between lipid and imatinib, within the liposomal membrane. Multilamellar (MLV) and small unilamellar (SUV) vesicles were prepared from alpha-L-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The effect of imatinib on the DPPC membrane was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), at pH 5.2 and 9.0, where imatinib is in monocationic and neutral form, respectively. Our results indicate that imatinib interacts mainly with the DPPC head groups, leading to a slight increase in the mobility of the polar headgroups in case of MLVs. Contrary to that, imatinib causes a significant decrease in the fluidity of SUVs, which can be the result of a pH-dependent fusion/fission effect. The size distribution and morphology of liposomes were checked by dynamic light scattering and freeze-fracture electron microscopy.

We have previously reported that U3-LTR from Moloney murine and feline leukemia viruses (Mo-MuLV and FeLV) upregulates specific cellular genes in trans in an integration-independent way. The U3-LTR region necessary for this action does not encode a protein but instead makes a specific RNA transcript. Because several cellular genes transactivated by the U3-LTR can also be activated by NFkappaB, and because the antiapoptotic and growth promoting activities of NFkappaB have been implicated in leukemogenesis, we investigated whether FeLV U3-LTR can activate NFkappaB signaling. Here, we demonstrate that FeLV U3-LTR indeed upregulates the NFkappaB signaling pathway via activation of Ras-Raf-IkappaB kinase (IKK) and degradation of IkappaB. LTR-mediated transcriptional activation of genes did not require new protein synthesis suggesting an active role of the LTR transcript in the process. Using Toll-like receptor (TLR) deficient HEK293 cells and PKR(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, we further demonstrate that although dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) is not necessary, TLR3 is required for the activation of NFkappaB by the LTR. Our study thus demonstrates involvement of a TLR3-dependent but PKR-independent dsRNA-mediated signaling pathway for NFkappaB activation and thus provides a new mechanistic explanation of LTR-mediated cellular gene transactivation.","['Abujamra, Ana L', 'Spanjaard, Remco A', 'Akinsheye, Idowu', 'Zhao, Xiansi', 'Faller, Douglas V', 'Ghosh, Sajal K']","['Abujamra AL', 'Spanjaard RA', 'Akinsheye I', 'Zhao X', 'Faller DV', 'Ghosh SK']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, 715 Albany Street, R908, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 3/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00645-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 Feb 20;345(2):390-403. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.10.003.

METHODS: The study included 280 incident cases and 288 hospitalized controls, frequency matched with the cases by age, gender and center. Data collection was completed by face-to-face standardized interviews of the case and control mothers. RESULTS: An association with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy was observed with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (OR=2.0 [1.4-3.0]) and acute non-lymphoid leukemia (ANLL) (OR=2.6 [1.2-5.8]). Maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy was associated with childhood acute leukemia, ORs increasing in ALL with coffee consumption (OR=1.1 [0.7-1.8], OR=2.4 [1.3-4.7] and OR=3.1 [1.0-9.5], respectively, for < or =3, 4-8 and >8 cups/day). No association with maternal smoking during pregnancy or parental smoking before or after the index child's birth was observed.

Here we investigated the presence of Mcl-1 protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and its potential role as a molecular drug target for HCC therapy. METHODS: HCC specimens of 149 patients were examined by immunohistochemistry for Mcl-1 expression. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting Mcl-1 were evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin in the HCC cell lines HepG2 and Snu398. Protein regulation, cell viability, and apoptosis were assessed by western blotting, cell counting, and FACS analysis. RESULTS: Mcl-1 protein is overexpressed in 51% of all cases irrespective of underlying disease. Targeting Mcl-1 by ASO specifically downregulated Mcl-1 protein expression and led to significant dose and time dependent single agent activity in HCC cells characterized by increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability. No significant target regulation or cell death was observed for control oligonucleotide treatment. Upon combination with cisplatin, Mcl-1 ASO revealed a significant chemosensitizing effect. CONCLUSIONS: Mcl-1 is overexpressed in half of HCC-tissues. ASO targeting Mcl-1 revealed a prominent single agent and chemosensitizing activity against HCC in vitro. Targeting Mcl-1 might qualify as a promising novel approach in HCC therapy.","['Sieghart, Wolfgang', 'Losert, Doris', 'Strommer, Sabine', 'Cejka, Daniel', 'Schmid, Katharina', 'Rasoul-Rockenschaub, Susanne', 'Bodingbauer, Martin', 'Crevenna, Richard', 'Monia, Brett P', 'Peck-Radosavljevic, Markus', 'Wacheck, Volker']","['Sieghart W', 'Losert D', 'Strommer S', 'Cejka D', 'Schmid K', 'Rasoul-Rockenschaub S', 'Bodingbauer M', 'Crevenna R', 'Monia BP', 'Peck-Radosavljevic M', 'Wacheck V']","['Section of Experimental Oncology/Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-8278(05)00622-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2005.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2006 Jan;44(1):151-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2005.09.010.

This azaoxoaporphine alkaloid primarily exhibits antifungal and antimycobacterial activities but also displays in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum and it is cytotoxic to human malignant melanoma cells. Recently, sampangine was described as a pro-apoptotic agent, but the biochemical pathway leading to cell death remained unclear. Considering that sampangine possesses an iminoquinone moiety, potentially functioning as an oxidizing agent, we have investigated the implication of an oxidant stress on sampangine-induced cytotoxicity. We show that the treatment of human HL-60 leukemia cells for 48 h with sampangine induced an important oxidative burst. Real time flow cytometry measurements indicated that the production of oxidative species is very rapid, within minutes following the drug addition. Quenching of reactive oxygen species by the antioxidants N-acetyl cystein, vitamin C and vitamin E abolishes the pro-apoptotic activity of sampangine. The drug-induced production of reactive oxygen species is associated with cell cycle perturbations and mitochondrial alterations.

An attempt was made in this study to investigate the mechanism of cell death in human leukemia Molt-4 and HL-60 cells. It inhibited Molt-4 cell proliferation with 48-h IC(50) of approximately 15 microg/ml, increased sub-G0 cell fraction with no mitotic block, produced apoptotic bodies and induced DNA ladder formation. Flow cytometric analysis of annexinV-FITC/PI-stained cells showed time-related increase in apoptosis and post-apoptotic necrosis. All these biological end-points indicated cell death by apoptosis. Further, initial events involved massive nitric oxide (NO) formation within 4 h with subsequent late appearance of peroxides in cells; measured by flow cytometry using specific fluorescent probes. Persistently high levels of NO and peroxide appeared to decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (Psi(mt)) which was recovered by cyclosporin A in Molt-4 cells. AP9-cd caused 2-fold activation of caspase-3 in Molt-4 and 5-fold activation in HL-60 cells. Also caspases-8 and -9 were activated in HL-60 cells. Ascorbate suppressed the enhanced caspases activities indicating a pro-oxidant effect of AP9-cd. Further, caspase-3 activation correlated with NO generation that was partially impaired by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors and ascorbate suggesting a role of pro-oxidant species in caspase-3 activation. AP9-cd produced no cytotoxicity in primary rat hepatocyte culture at the concentrations used. The studies indicated that AP9-cd mediated early NO formation leads to caspases activation, peroxide generation, and mitochondrial depolarization which may be responsible for mitochondrial-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways involved in the killing of leukemia cells by AP9-cd.","['Shashi, Bhushan', 'Jaswant, Singh', 'Madhusudana, Rao J', 'Kumar, Saxena A', 'Nabi, Qazi G']","['Shashi B', 'Jaswant S', 'Madhusudana RJ', 'Kumar SA', 'Nabi QG']","['Division of Pharmacology, Regional Research Laboratory (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research), Jammu Tawi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nitric Oxide,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,9709307,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cedrus/*chemistry', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Necrosis', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Peroxides/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",,2005/11/18 09:00,2006/05/19 09:00,['2005/11/18 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1089-8603(05)00145-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.niox.2005.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Nitric Oxide. 2006 Feb;14(1):72-88. doi: 10.1016/j.niox.2005.09.009.

Significant roles for non-caspase proteases in cell death have been highlighted. Staurosporine causes a rapid induction of apoptosis in virtually all mammalian cell types. Numerous studies demonstrate that staurosporine can activate cell death under caspase-inhibiting circumstances. The aim of this study was to investigate the proteolytic mechanisms responsible for cell death under these conditions. To that end, we show that inhibitors of serine proteases can delay cell death in one such system. Furthermore, through profiling of proteolytic activation, we demonstrate, for the first time, that staurosporine activates a chymotrypsin-like serine protease-dependent cell death in HL-60 cells independently, but in parallel with the caspase controlled systems. Features of the serine protease-mediated system include cell shrinkage and apoptotic morphology, regulation of caspase-3, altered nuclear morphology, generation of an endonuclease and DNA degradation.

METHODS: HIV-based lentiviral vectors were pseudotyped with four different envelope proteins; amphotropic murine leukaemia virus (ampho), murine leukaemia virus (10A1), feline endogenous virus (RD114), and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). These pseudotypes were examined for transduction efficiency in human bone marrow derived MSC. The effect of lentiviral expression of truncated soluble vascular endothelial growth factor decoy receptor (tsFlk-1) in MSC on growth of Raji cells was determined, both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: All lentiviral vectors produced significant levels of transduction at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, those bearing the RD114 envelope glycoprotein consistently produced higher transduction levels (mean 70 +/- 6%) compared with the other pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, although there was significant inter-donor variation. Stable transgene expression was achieved after multiple rounds of transduction with VSVG-pseudotyped particles, without alteration in the differentiative capacity of transduced cells. Co-injection of MSC stably expressing tsFlk-1 with Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cells significantly impaired subcutaneous tumour growth in immunodeficient mice when compared to controls where either unmanipulated MSC or GFP-expressing MSC were used. CONCLUSIONS: Human MSC are easily transduced by pseudotyped lentiviral particles but there is inter-donor variation in transduction efficiency.

METHODS: The study cohort was comprised of 199 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL who were treated at 1 of 2 South Texas pediatric oncology centers between 1990-2000. The relative chemotherapy dose modification during the induction phase of chemotherapy was calculated as the ratio of 1) the actual administered dose of L-asparaginase and 2) the protocol-calculated dose of L-asparaginase. The extent to which the chemotherapy dose modification varied according to obesity status was assessed using stratified Student t tests and an ordinary least-squares regression analysis. RESULTS: Obese ALL patients were found to exhibit a 7% decrease in the mean relative modification of L-asparaginase during induction chemotherapy compared with their nonobese counterparts. This finding was statistically significant (P = 0.009), even after adjustment for gender, age, ethnicity, and clinical institution. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first published report of an obesity-associated chemotherapy dose modification in pediatric patients with ALL, the most common childhood malignancy. It will be important to examine whether these findings are consistent with those observed in future studies, and ultimately to assess the association between obesity-related dose modifications and long-term cancer outcomes.","['Baillargeon, Jacques', 'Langevin, Anne-Marie', 'Lewis, Margaret', 'Thomas, Paul J', 'Mullins, Judith', 'Dugan, John', 'Pollock, Brad H']","['Baillargeon J', 'Langevin AM', 'Lewis M', 'Thomas PJ', 'Mullins J', 'Dugan J', 'Pollock BH']","['Center for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, 78229, USA. baillargeon@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', '*Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Obesity/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/ethnology', 'Probability', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,2005/11/17 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/11/17 09:00'],"['2005/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21584 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Dec 15;104(12):2858-61. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21584.,['CA11078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

Increased hsp70 levels inhibit death receptor and mitochondria-initiated signaling for apoptosis. Here, we show that ectopic overexpression of hsp70 in human acute myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells (HL-60/hsp70) and high endogenous hsp70 levels in Bcr-Abl-expressing cultured CML-BC K562 cells confers resistance to 17-AAG-induced apoptosis. In HL-60/hsp70 cells, hsp70 was bound to Bax, inhibited 17-AAG-mediated Bax conformation change and mitochondrial localization, thereby inhibiting the mitochondria-initiated events of apoptosis. Treatment with 17-AAG attenuated the levels of phospho-AKT, AKT, and c-Raf but increased hsp70 levels to a similar extent in the control HL-60/Neo and HL-60/hsp70 cells. Pretreatment with 17-AAG, which induced hsp70, inhibited 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Stable transfection of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to hsp70 completely abrogated the endogenous levels of hsp70 and blocked 17-AAG-mediated hsp70 induction, resulting in sensitizing K562/siRNA-hsp70 cells to 17-AAG-induced apoptosis. This was associated with decreased binding of Bax to hsp70 and increased 17-AAG-induced Bax conformation change. 17-AAG-mediated decline in the levels of AKT, c-Raf, and Bcr-Abl was similar in K562 and K562/siRNA-hsp70 cells. Cotreatment with KNK437, a benzylidine lactam inhibitor of hsp70 induction and thermotolerance, attenuated 17-AAG-mediated hsp70 induction and increased 17-AAG-induced apoptosis and loss of clonogenic survival of HL-60 cells. Collectively, these data indicate that induction of hsp70 attenuates the apoptotic effects of 17-AAG, and abrogation of hsp70 induction significantly enhances the antileukemia activity of 17-AAG.","['Guo, Fei', 'Rocha, Kathy', 'Bali, Purva', 'Pranpat, Michael', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Boyapalle, Sandhya', 'Kumaraswamy, Sandhya', 'Balasis, Maria', 'Greedy, Benjamin', 'Armitage, E Simon M', 'Lawrence, Nicholas', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Guo F', 'Rocha K', 'Bali P', 'Pranpat M', 'Fiskus W', 'Boyapalle S', 'Kumaraswamy S', 'Balasis M', 'Greedy B', 'Armitage ES', 'Lawrence N', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

CEBPA loss-of-function mutations identified in acute myeloid leukemia patients support a tumor suppressor role for C/EBPalpha. Recent work showed reductions of C/EBPalpha levels in human hepatocellular carcinoma with the reductions correlating to tumor size and progression. We investigated the potential of reactivating c/ebpalpha expression during hepatic carcinogenesis to prevent tumor cell growth. We have developed a c/ebpalpha knock-in mouse in which a single-copy c/ebpalpha is regulated by one allele of the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene promoter. The knock-in mice are physically indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) controls. However, knock-in animals were found to deposit fetal hepatic glycogen earlier than WT animals. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed early c/ebpalpha expression and early glycogen synthase gene activation in knock-in fetuses. We then used diethylnitrosamine to induce hepatocellular carcinoma in our animals. Diethylnitrosamine produced half the number of hepatocellular nodules in knock-in mice as in WT mice. Immunohistochemistry showed reduced C/EBPalpha content in WT nodules whereas knock-in nodules stained strongly for C/EBPalpha. The p21 protein was examined because it mediates a C/EBPalpha growth arrest pathway. Nuclear p21 was absent in WT nodules whereas cytoplasmic p21 was abundant; knock-in nodules were positive for nuclear p21. Interestingly, only C/EBPalpha-positive nodules were positive for nuclear p21, suggesting that C/EBPalpha may be required to direct p21 to the cell nucleus to inhibit growth. Our data establish that controlled C/EBPalpha production can inhibit liver tumor growth in vivo.","['Tan, Ee Hong', 'Hooi, Shing Chuan', 'Laban, Mirtha', 'Wong, Esther', 'Ponniah, Sathivel', 'Wee, Aileen', 'Wang, Nai-dy']","['Tan EH', 'Hooi SC', 'Laban M', 'Wong E', 'Ponniah S', 'Wee A', 'Wang ND']","['Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glycogen Synthase/biosynthesis', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Liver Glycogen/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/genetics']",,2005/11/17 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/11/17 09:00'],"['2005/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/22/10330 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4486 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 15;65(22):10330-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4486.,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Liver Glycogen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.11 (Glycogen Synthase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, the dimension of the feature space (the number of genes) is typically much greater than the number of tissues. We consider high-density oligonucleotide microarray data, where the expression level is associated to an 'absolute call', which represents a qualitative indication of whether or not a transcript is detected within a sample. The 'absolute call' is generally not taken in consideration in analyses. RESULTS: In contrast to frequently used cluster analysis methods to analyze gene expression data, we consider a problem of classification of tissues and of the variables selection. We adopted methodologies formulated by Ghahramani and Hinton and Rocci and Vichi for simultaneous dimensional reduction of genes and classification of tissues; trying to identify genes (denominated 'markers') that are able to distinguish between two known different classes of tissue samples. In this respect, we propose a generalization of the approach proposed by McLachlan et al. by advising to estimate the distribution of log LR statistic for testing one versus two component hypothesis in the mixture model for each gene considered individually, using a parametric bootstrap approach. We compare conditional (on 'absolute call') and unconditional analyses performed on dataset described in Golub et al. We show that the proposed techniques improve the results of classification of tissue samples with respect to known results on the same benchmark dataset.

Here, we demonstrate that the attachment of SUMO-1 to Tax regulates its localization in nuclear bodies and the recruitment of both the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB and free IKKgamma in these nuclear structures. However, this sumoylation step is not sufficient for the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway by Tax. This activity requires the prior ubiquitination and colocalization of ubiquitinated Tax with IKK complexes in the cytoplasm and the subsequent migration of the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB to the nucleus. Thus, the ubiquitination and sumoylation of Tax function in concert to result in the migration of RelA to the nucleus and its accumulation with IKKgamma in nuclear bodies for activation of gene expression.

Here we present evidence that the large subunit of mammalian NF-E2, p45, is sumoylated in vivo in human erythroid K562 cells and in mouse fetal liver. By in vitro sumoylation reaction and DNA transfection experiments, we show that the sumoylation occurs at lysine 368 (K368) of human p45/NF-E2. Furthermore, p45 sumoylation enhances the transactivation capability of NF-E2, and this is accompanied by an increase of the NF-E2 DNA binding affinity. More interestingly, we have found that in K562 cells, the beta-globin gene loci in the euchromatin regions are predominantly colocalized with the nuclear bodies promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) oncogenic domains that are enriched with the PML, SUMO-1, RNA polymerase II, and sumoylatable p45/NF-E2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further showed that the intact sumoylation site of p45/NF-E2 is required for its binding to the DNase I-hypersensitive sites of the beta-globin locus control region. Finally, we demonstrated by stable transfection assay that only the wild-type p45, but not its mutant form p45 (K368R), could efficiently rescue beta-globin gene expression in the p45-null, erythroid cell line CB3.

In this study, we have used a proteomic approach to characterize multiprotein complexes containing the key hematopoietic regulator SCL in erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines. One of the novel SCL-interacting proteins identified in both cell types is the transcriptional corepressor ETO-2. Interaction between endogenous proteins was confirmed in primary cells. We then showed that SCL complexes are shared but also significantly differ in the two cell types. Importantly, SCL/ETO-2 interacts with another corepressor, Gfi-1b, in red cells but not megakaryocytes. The SCL/ETO-2/Gfi-1b association is lost during erythroid differentiation of primary fetal liver cells. Genetic studies of erythroid cells show that ETO-2 exerts a repressor effect on SCL target genes.

A series of alpha-substituted glycine derivatives of 5-FU containing carboxylic groups were prepared, and cyclotriphosphazenes with amino groups were synthesized via the stepwise substitution of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (NPCl(2))(3) with methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) or alkoxy ethylene oxide and lysine ethyl ester (LysOEt). The coupling reaction of the two derivatives, and their subsequent deprotection, yielded a thermosenstive 5-FU-cyclotriphosphazene conjugate, which exhibited a unique octopus-shaped molecular structure, in which the three hydrophilic PEG groups (or alkoxy ethylene oxides) were oriented in one direction, opposing the other three hydrophobic groups containing 5-FU, with respect to the trimer ring plane. This conjugate exhibited a reversible and thermosensitive phase transition in an aqueous medium, from soluble to insoluble states. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the conjugate was controlled by substitution with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic side groups, and a few of the conjugates displayed LCSTs which were just below body temperature. This, of course, implies possible applications for local drug delivery by direct intratumoral injection. The conjugate exhibited gradual degradation at 37 degrees C in both neutral and acidic buffer solutions, and high temperature significantly facilitated its hydrolytic degradation. All of the conjugates displayed dose-dependent cytotoxicity against the leukemia L1210 cell line and exhibited more pronounced cytotoxic effects than did 5-FU.","['Cho, Yong Woo', 'Lee, Jeong-Ryel', 'Song, Soo-Chang']","['Cho YW', 'Lee JR', 'Song SC']","['Division of Life Science, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul 130-650, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fluorouracil/*administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Nitriles/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phase Transition', 'Phosphorus Compounds/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Temperature']",,2005/11/17 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/11/17 09:00'],"['2005/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bc049697u [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2005 Nov-Dec;16(6):1529-35. doi: 10.1021/bc049697u.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '291-37-2 (cyclotriphosphazene ester)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An age-period-cohort analysis on Norwegian data from 1953 to 1997.,2035-9,"Between 1955 and 1963, an estimated number of 150 million people in various parts of the world, including Norway, received poliomyelitis vaccine possibly contaminated with infectious simian virus 40 (SV40). Human studies have investigated the hypothesised association between SV40 and various cancers, but the results have so far been contradicting. The aim of the present study was to examine Norwegian cancer incidence data to assess a possible association between birth cohorts assumed to have been subjected to the vaccine and the incidence rate of lymphoproliferative disorders (excluding Hodgkin's lymphoma), further subdivided into non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), lymphocytic leukemia and plasma cell neoplasms. Between 1953 and 1997, the incidence rate of lymphoproliferative diseases combined increased about 3-fold in both males and females. Subgroup analysis showed that this increase was largely attributable to NHL. Age-period-cohort modelling of the subgroups, as well as of all groups combined, showed that the cohort effect was more prominent than the period effect. However, the variations in incidence patterns across the birth cohorts did not fit with the trends that would be expected if a SV40 contaminated vaccine did play a causative role. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis of an association between the vaccine and any subgroup of lymphoproliferative diseases.","['Thu, Guri Olsen', 'Hem, Ling Yuan', 'Hansen, Svein', 'Moller, Bjorn', 'Norstein, Jarle', 'Nokleby, Hanne', 'Grotmol, Tom']","['Thu GO', 'Hem LY', 'Hansen S', 'Moller B', 'Norstein J', 'Nokleby H', 'Grotmol T']","['The Cancer Registry of Norway-Institute of Population-based Cancer Research, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', '*Drug Contamination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*epidemiology/*etiology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Poliovirus Vaccines/*adverse effects/standards', 'Risk Factors', 'Simian virus 40/*pathogenicity']",,2005/11/16 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/11/16 09:00'],"['2005/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21603 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Apr 15;118(8):2035-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21603.,,['0 (Poliovirus Vaccines)'],,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

PARK2 is linked to a novel described PACRG gene by a bidirectional promoter containing a defined CpG island in its common promoter region. We have studied the role of promoter hypermethylation in the regulation of PARK2 and PACRG expression in different tumor cell lines and primary patient samples. Abnormal methylation of the common promoter of PARK2 and PACRG was observed in 26% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 20% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis, but not in ovarian, breast, lung, neuroblastoma, astrocytoma or colon cancer cells. Abnormal methylation resulted in downregulation of PARK2 and PACRG gene expression, while demethylation of ALL cells resulted in demethylation of the promoter and upregulation of PARK2 and PACRG expression. By FISH, we demonstrated that a lack of PARK2 and PACRG expression was due to biallelic hypermethylation and not to deletion of either PARK2 or PACRG in ALL. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that the candidate tumor suppressor genes PARK2 and PACRG are epigenetically regulated in human leukemia, suggesting that abnormal methylation and regulation of PARK2 and PACRG may play a role in the pathogenesis and development of this hematological neoplasm.","['Agirre, Xabier', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Vazquez, Iria', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Garate, Leire', 'Montiel-Duarte, Cristina', 'Artieda, Paula', 'Cordeu, Lucia', 'Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Minna, John D', 'Prosper, Felipe']","['Agirre X', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Vazquez I', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Garate L', 'Montiel-Duarte C', 'Artieda P', 'Cordeu L', 'Lahortiga I', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A', 'Minna JD', 'Prosper F']","['Foundation for Applied Medical Research, Division of Cancer, Area of Cell Therapy and Hematology Service, Clinica Universitaria, Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,2005/11/16 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/11/16 09:00'],"['2005/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21584 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Apr 15;118(8):1945-53. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21584.,"['P50CA70907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01CA7629303/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (PACRG protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (parkin protein)']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

This study included 8 cases of inpatients diagnosed by echography and NMR with testicular tumors. The age of patients was between 46 and 81 (with a mean of 52). The tumors were unilateral, with disease limited to testicle and accompanied by pain except 1 case with bone involvement. Orchectomy was performed as first therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. All patients were clinically staged according to the Ann Arbor criteria in IE and IIID stage and received a doxorubicin based chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, MTX, CVP, and Leukeran). A standard chemotherapy protocol has not been used because of reduced number of patients. Tumor fragments were fixed in 10% formallin, paraffin embedded, sectioned and standard H.E. stained. Immunohistochemistry for L26, Alphafetoprotein, NK1, CD30, and CLA was performed. Microscopy revealed in all cases a stromal proliferation with medium size cells, monomorphic shape and prominent nucleoli. Alphafetoprotein was positive in seminal tubes and negative in tumor, NK1 in small lymphocyte and negative in tumor and L26 diffuse positive in tumor. CLA diffuse positive in tumor. We were able to follow up only four patients. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis was of NHML in 6 cases and for 2 secondary involvement of hematopoietic malignancy (myeloid sarcoma and leukemia). Lymphoma cases were typed using REAL classification as small and large B-cell lymphoma.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia. Adverse cutaneous reactions induced by imatinib are frequent and may be dose related. We report a case of an unusual pustular eruption in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, who received high doses imatinib for blast crisis and later voriconazole for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. At the time of his skin eruption, elevated plasma levels of imatinib were recorded. Imatinib is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome CYP3A4. Voriconazole is a cytochrome CYP3A4 inhibitor and can lead to high plasma levels of imatinib. This case suggests that severe drug reactions to imatinib may be related not only to imatinib doses, but also to elevated plasma drug levels resulting from pharmacokinetic interactions.

No clear associations were found, but claims were then made that the release of radioactive substances such as strontium 90 from the St Lucie nuclear power station, which began operating in 1976, might have played a role. To test the plausibility of this hypothesis, we extended by 17 years a previous study of county mortality conducted by the National Cancer Institute. Rates of total cancer, leukaemia and cancer of brain and other nervous tissue in children and across all ages in St Lucie County were evaluated with respect to the years before and after the nuclear power station began operation and contrasted with rates in two similar counties in Florida (Polk and Volusia). Over the prolonged period 1950-2000, no unusual patterns of childhood cancer mortality were found for St Lucie County as a whole. In particular, no unusual patterns of childhood cancer mortality were seen in relation to the start-up of the St Lucie nuclear power station in 1976. Further, there were no significant differences in mortality between the study and comparison counties for any cancer in the time period after the power station was in operation. Relative rates for all childhood cancers and for childhood leukaemia were higher before the nuclear facility began operating than after, while rates of brain and other nervous tissue cancer were slightly lower in St Lucie County than in the two comparison counties for both time periods. Although definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from descriptive studies, these data provide no support for the hypothesis that the operation of the St Lucie nuclear power station has adversely affected the cancer mortality experience of county residents.","['Boice, John D Jr', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Blot, William J', 'Heath, Clark W Jr']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Mumma MT', 'Blot WJ', 'Heath CW Jr']","['International Epidemiology Institute, 1455 Research Blvd, Suite 550 Rockville, MD 20850, USA. john.boice@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Florida/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Risk Assessment']",,2005/11/16 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/11/16 09:00'],"['2005/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0952-4746(05)04011-5 [pii]', '10.1088/0952-4746/25/3/001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2005 Sep;25(3):229-40. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/25/3/001.

To obtain mechanistic insight into benzene's mechanism of action, we examined the impact of benzene on the human serum proteome in a study of exposed healthy shoe-factory workers and unexposed controls. Two sequential studies were performed, each using sera from 10 workers exposed to benzene (overall mean benzene air level >30 ppm) and 10 controls. Serum samples were subjected to anion-exchange fractionation and bound to three types of ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA) [hydrophobic (H50), metal affinity (IMAC3-Cu), and cation exchange (WCX2)]. Protein-expression patterns were detected by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI)-TOF MS. Three proteins (4.1, 7.7, and 9.3 kDa) were consistently down-regulated in exposed compared with control subjects in both studies. All proteins were highly inversely correlated with individual estimates of benzene exposure (r > 0.75). The 7.7- and 9.3-kDa proteins were subsequently identified as platelet factor (PF)4 and connective tissue activating peptide (CTAP)-III. Initial proteomic results for PF4 and CTAP-III were subsequently confirmed in a single experiment using a ProteinChip-array-based immunoassay(Ciphergen Biosystems). The altered expression of the platelet-derived CXC-chemokines (40% and 63% for PF4 and CTAP-III, respectively) could not be explained by changes in absolute platelet counts. Thus, SELDI-TOF analysis of a limited number of exposed and unexposed subjects revealed that lowered expression of PF4 and CTAP-III proteins is a potential biomarker of benzene's early biologic effects and may play a role in the immunosuppressive effects of benzene.","['Vermeulen, Roel', 'Lan, Qing', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Gunn, Laura', 'McCarthy, Diane', 'Woodbury, Ronald L', 'McGuire, Marielena', 'Podust, Vladimir N', 'Li, Guilan', 'Chatterjee, Nilanjan', 'Mu, Ruidong', 'Yin, Songnian', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Vermeulen R', 'Lan Q', 'Zhang L', 'Gunn L', 'McCarthy D', 'Woodbury RL', 'McGuire M', 'Podust VN', 'Li G', 'Chatterjee N', 'Mu R', 'Yin S', 'Rothman N', 'Smith MT']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. vermeulr@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Validation Study']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['*Benzene/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chemokines, CXC/*blood', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', '*Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Protein Array Analysis', '*Proteomics']",,2005/11/16 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/11/16 09:00'],"['2005/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0508573102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0508573102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Nov 22;102(47):17041-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0508573102.

We show here that, in BCR/ABL-transformed cells and CML blast crisis (CML-BC) progenitors, the phosphatase activity of the tumor suppressor PP2A is inhibited by the BCR/ABL-induced expression of the PP2A inhibitor SET. In imatinib-sensitive and -resistant (T315I included) BCR/ABL+ cell lines and CML-BC progenitors, molecular and/or pharmacological activation of PP2A promotes dephosphorylation of key regulators of cell proliferation and survival, suppresses BCR/ABL activity, and induces BCR/ABL degradation. Furthermore, PP2A activation results in growth suppression, enhanced apoptosis, restored differentiation, impaired clonogenic potential, and decreased in vivo leukemogenesis of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant BCR/ABL+ cells. Thus, functional inactivation of PP2A is essential for BCR/ABL leukemogenesis and, perhaps, required for blastic transformation.","['Neviani, Paolo', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Notari, Mario', 'Blaser, Bradley W', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Mao, Hsiaoyin', 'Chang, Ji Suk', 'Galietta, Annamaria', 'Uttam, Ashwin', 'Roy, Denis C', 'Valtieri, Mauro', 'Bruner-Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Neviani P', 'Santhanam R', 'Trotta R', 'Notari M', 'Blaser BW', 'Liu S', 'Mao H', 'Chang JS', 'Galietta A', 'Uttam A', 'Roy DC', 'Valtieri M', 'Bruner-Klisovic R', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Marcucci G', 'Perrotti D']","['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*physiology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",,2005/11/16 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/11/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-6108(05)00336-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2005.10.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2005 Nov;8(5):355-68. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2005.10.015.,"['R01 CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (PPP2R1B protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Ppp2r1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
