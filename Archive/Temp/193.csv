Of the 56 children in the cohort, 27 had a non-malignant disease and 29 had different hematological malignancies. Eight were in first remission of leukemia and the remainder in later stages. Donors were in 16 cases a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling and in 40 a matched unrelated donor (MUD). The control group comprised 16 patients with an HLA-identical donor; the children in this group were not treated with ATG. Side-effects related to the ATG treatment occurred in 63% of the patients and included fever, chills, headache, dyspnoea, nausea/vomiting, body pain, fall in blood pressure, and transient respiratory arrest. Engraftment occurred in 55 (98%) of the ATG-treated patients at a median of 17 (11-27) days after ASCT. One rejection occurred at 23 days post-SCT. The probabilities of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of grades II-IV were 6% for patients with an HLA-identical donor, 12% for controls, and 26% for the MUD group. Chronic GvHD occured in 20%, 50%, and 50% of patients in the three groups, respectively. Transplant-related mortality rates at 100 days were 6%, 6%, and 7%, respectively. The 5-yr survival rate was 94% and 81% using sibling donors, with and without ATG respectively, and 53% using unrelated donors (p = 0.002). Disregarding donor type, among the ATG-treated patients 5-yr survival rates were 46% in patients with a malignant disease and 77% in non-malignant disorders. Relapse and relapse-free survival rates were 42% and 46%, respectively. Five out of 12 patients who showed an early full donor chimerism in the T-cell lineage developed acute GvHD of grades II-IV, compared to none out of 13 patients being mixed chimeras (p = 0.01). Hence, the use of polyclonal ATG as part of conditioning prior to ASCT in children is safe and the survival rate encouraging.","['Remberger, M', 'Mattsson, J', 'Ringden, O']","['Remberger M', 'Mattsson J', 'Ringden O']","['Center for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, Department of Clinical Immunology, F79 Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.

However, there are no available data on the prognostic significance of CD44 expression of tumor tissue correlated with serum sCD44 level in childhood leukemias and lymphomas. METHODS: Serum levels and leukemic cell tumor tissue expression of CD44 were detected in 54 children with acute leukemia and malignant lymphoma. Serum samples were obtained from all patients before treatment and during remission. Twelve age-matched healthy children were included as a control group. RESULTS: The serum CD44 levels were significantly higher in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than those in the control group. The median values were 1627.0, 1336.0, 1318.5, 1730.4, 902.7 ng/mL, respectively, and P<0.001, P<0.01, P<0.01, P<0.05 in comparisons, respectively. However, there was no significant difference between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the control group (median values: 900.3 and 902.7 ng/mL, respectively, P>0.05). Serum sCD44 levels significantly declined in HD, NHL and ALL patients who were in complete remission (median values: 684.0, 573.8 and 1101.1 ng/mL, respectively, P<0.05 in each comparison). Patients with HD had higher levels of serum sCD44 and correlated well with higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), B-symptoms and advanced-stage disease (P<0.05, P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Expression of CD44 was significantly high in patients with HD and NHL who were in advanced stages of disease. High serum CD44 level was also associated with high tumor tissue expression of CD44 in patients with HD and BL. In addition, patients with higher levels of serum sCD44, had a poorer outcome and survival than those with lower sCD44 levels in HD and NHL groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high serum sCD44 level and/or tumor tissue expression at diagnosis is associated with poor prognostic criteria and/or unfavorable outcome in childhood leukemias and lymphomas.","['Tacyildiz, N', 'Cavdar, A O', 'Yavuz, G', 'Gozdasoglu, S', 'Unal, E', 'Ertem, U', 'Duru, F', 'Ikinciogullari, A', 'Babacan, E', 'Kuzu, I', 'Cin, S']","['Tacyildiz N', 'Cavdar AO', 'Yavuz G', 'Gozdasoglu S', 'Unal E', 'Ertem U', 'Duru F', 'Ikinciogullari A', 'Babacan E', 'Kuzu I', 'Cin S']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara University Medical School, Turkey. nurdan@hitit.ato.org.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/*metabolism/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/*metabolism/mortality', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/blood/*metabolism', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['ped1415 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1442-200x.2001.01415.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2001 Aug;43(4):354-60. doi: 10.1046/j.1442-200x.2001.01415.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for selective effects on adhesion to extracellular matrix components via SSTR2 and/or 3.,71-9,"We have examined normal T-cells and T-cell lines with respect to expression of various somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTR1--5) using RT-PCR and PCR. To evaluate the function of these receptors we have further studied the effects of subtype specific signalling on T-cell adhesion using somatostatin analogs specific for various receptors as probes. Human T-lymphocytes showed SSTR expression related to activation and stage of differentiation. Normal T-cells (peripheral blood, T-cell clone) and T-leukaemia cell lines expressed SSTR2, SSTR3 and SSTR4. Normal T-cells expressed SSTR1 and SSTR5 while T-leukaemia lines did not. SSTR5 was selectively expressed in activated normal T-cells. T-lymphocytes produced no somatostatin themselves. Somatostatin and somatostatin analogs specific for SSTR2 and/or SSTR3 enhanced adhesion of T-cells to fibronectin (FN), and to a certain extent, also to collagen type IV (CIV) and laminin (LAM). T-lymphocytes express multiple SSTR and somatostatin may therefore regulate lymphocyte functions via distinct receptor subtypes as shown here for adhesion to extracellular matrix components (ECM) via SSTR2 and SSTR3. SSTR expression also distinguishes normal and leukaemic T-cells. Our findings suggest that SSTR subtypes may be useful targets for therapy during inflammatory diseases and malignancies affecting lymphocytes.","['Talme, T', 'Ivanoff, J', 'Hagglund, M', 'Van Neerven, R J', 'Ivanoff, A', 'Sundqvist, K G']","['Talme T', 'Ivanoff J', 'Hagglund M', 'Van Neerven RJ', 'Ivanoff A', 'Sundqvist KG']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Dermatology and Venereology, Karolinska Institutet at Huddinge University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', '0 (somatostatin receptor 3)', '0 (somatostatin receptor subtype-4)', '0 (somatostatin receptor type 1)', '8X85ZJG6XJ (somatostatin receptor 5)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'D73QL0OMU2 (somatostatin receptor 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Laminin/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['cei1577 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01577.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2001 Jul;125(1):71-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01577.x.,PMC1906108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recurrence of disease is a result of the failure of the immune system to recognize these abnormal cells and down-regulation of crucial molecules required for cognate CD4(+) T cell recognition has been postulated as a means of immune escape. In this study we show that an embryonic kidney cell line (293 cells) transfected with CD154 (40 L.1) are capable of not only maintaining the viability of primary ALL cells in culture but can also up-regulate the expression of a number of crucial molecules involved in antigen recognition. We show that 40 L.1 cell stimulation of primary ALL cell cultures can not only enhance the allogeneic and autologous MLR response to such cells but will also induce CTL effectors which are capable of lysing wild-type autologous ALL cells. It is therefore conceivable that such an approach could be used to generate an active anti-tumour response in patients, following conventional therapy, reducing the incidence of recurrence.","['Lee, A J', 'Haworth, C', 'Hutchinson, R M', 'Patel, R', 'Carter, R', 'James, R F']","['Lee AJ', 'Haworth C', 'Hutchinson RM', 'Patel R', 'Carter R', 'James RF']","['Department of Surgery, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['cei1562 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01562.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2001 Jun;124(3):359-68. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01562.x.,PMC1906064,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that at mid- and late gestation, approximately 2% and 0.5% of fetal bone marrow cells were CD34(+) respectively. The mean distance of CD34(+) cells from the nearest trabecular bone surface was 61 +/- 4 and 46 +/- 4 microm, respectively, for mid- and late gestation. The mean distance to the nearest neighbour was 46 +/- 5 and 105 +/- 15 microm, and the mean distance to the nearest blood vessel was 13 +/- 1 and 17 +/- 2 microm respectively. The concentration of CD34(+) cells in the peripheral region was 6.5 times greater than that at the centre of the sections. Overall, the percentage number of CD34(+) cells decreased with gestational age. The cellular and nuclear diameters of CD34(+) cells remained unchanged throughout mid- and late gestation at 5.4 +/- 0.1 and 3.8 +/- 0.1 microm respectively.

In this study, we examined the in vitro effects of flavopiridol and fludarabine on B-CLL cells from 64 patients (36 treated and 28 untreated) in terms of apoptosis induction and Bcl-2 family expression. Both flavopiridol and fludarabine induced apoptosis in all the samples tested with mean LD(50) values (+/- SD) of 59.7 nmol/l (+/- 36.5) and 6.2 micromol/l (+/- 7.5) respectively. Mean flavopiridol LD(50) values were not significantly different between the treated and untreated patient groups (P = 0.35), whereas the fludarabine LD(50) values were significantly higher in the previously treated patient group (P = 0.01). Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression were downregulated in both flavopiridol and fludarabine-induced apoptotic cells, but the increase in Bax expression that accompanied fludarabine-induced apoptosis was not evident in flavopiridol-treated cells. In addition, Bcl-2:Bax ratios were not predictive of flavopiridol cytotoxicity (P = 0.82), whereas they were highly predictive of in vitro responsiveness to fludarabine (P = 0.001). Overall, these findings suggest that flavopiridol exerts its cytotoxic effect through a novel cell-death pathway that is not subject to the Bcl-2 family mediated resistance mechanisms that reduce the efficacy of many conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Pepper, C', 'Thomas, A', 'Hoy, T', 'Fegan, C', 'Bentley, P']","['Pepper C', 'Thomas A', 'Hoy T', 'Fegan C', 'Bentley P']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penarth, South Glamorgan, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Flavonoids/*therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2895 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02895.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jul;114(1):70-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02895.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fas-mediated apoptosis on normal and leukaemic T cells is finely tuned by inhibitory proteins, such as FAP-1, FLIP and survivin, and defective caspase isoform which can attenuate the function of its intact caspase as a decoy molecule. However, complex involvement of such inhibitors in tumour biology relating to apoptotic pathology remains unclear in the neoplasms. We report the aberrant expression of FAP-1, FLIP and survivin mRNAs on leukaemic T cells from adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) patients. Among these inhibitors, only survivin was aberrantly expressed in all ATL cases, but not in any normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, survivin mRNA expression level was characteristic in each subtype of ATL and represented an important determinant for ATL prognosis. However, the apoptotic effector of casp-8, which is essential in Fas-mediated signal transduction, was dominant in defective casp-8 rather than intact casp-8 in ATL cells, suggesting a favourable biological situation for escape from apoptosis. Taken together, ATL cells probably possess many different regulatory mechanisms in order to attenuate Fas-mediated signalling and subsequently expand their populations under escape from apoptosis. Among these inhibitors, survivin is a useful bio-marker to assess tumour biology and may be a potential new target for apoptosis-based selective therapy in neoplasms as the expression is a general feature of neoplasia, but not normal tissues.","['Kamihira, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Hirakata, Y', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Sugahara, K', 'Hayashi, T', 'Dateki, N', 'Harasawa, H', 'Nakayama, K']","['Kamihira S', 'Yamada Y', 'Hirakata Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Sugahara K', 'Hayashi T', 'Dateki N', 'Harasawa H', 'Nakayama K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan. kamihira@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', '*Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/genetics']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2902 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02902.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jul;114(1):63-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02902.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cells from donor blood were incubated with separated myeloid leukaemia cells or T cells from the HLA-identical sibling recipient. In five of the six patients tested, the T-cell V beta skewing pattern observed in vitro was seen in vivo after transplant. After transplant, the myeloid-specific V beta skewing coincided with the disappearance of residual disease in three patients and in one patient skewing was lost at the time of leukaemic relapse. In functional tests, T cells generated against leukaemic cells in vitro produced interferon gamma in response to the leukaemia. Removal of the leukaemia-expanded skewed V beta families significantly decreased cytotoxic killing of the leukaemia. However, while there was a general concordance in the V beta family exhibiting clonal expansion in vitro and in vivo, the exact clonotype expanded in vitro and in vivo differed.

This B-cell lineage is established during ontogeny and replenished by the process of self-renewal. Spontaneous and induced leukaemias that frequently affect this lineage are thought to arise as a result of the frequent cell division required to maintain the population throughout adulthood and in response to repeated exposure to environmental antigens. In a series of bone marrow transplant (BMT) experiments performed in B6D2F1 mice, B-cell leukaemia occurred in recipients of serially transplanted syngeneic bone marrow. This study was therefore designed to determine the frequency and phenotype of the observed leukaemia. Male donor cells were initially transplanted into lethally irradiated female hosts and secondary (2 degrees ) BMT was performed at 3 months. At 1, 2, 3 and 16 months following primary (1 degrees ) BMT, and when 2 degrees BMT recipients developed leukaemia, animals were sacrificed and their tissues extensively examined. These analyses confirmed a host-derived CD5(+) transplantable B-cell leukaemia that was initiated in 50% of 1 degrees BMT recipients. With serial passage, the leukaemia became more aggressive and lost CD5 expression, suggesting transformation to a high-grade leukaemia/lymphoma. This previously unreported observation suggests that the combination of radiation and subsequent serial transplantation induces a proliferative stress to the host B-cell compartment that is causative in leukaemic transformation.","['Holyoake, T L', 'Freshney, M G', 'Samuel, K', 'Ansell, J', 'Watson, G E', 'Wright, E G', 'Graham, G J', 'Pragnell, I B']","['Holyoake TL', 'Freshney MG', 'Samuel K', 'Ansell J', 'Watson GE', 'Wright EG', 'Graham GJ', 'Pragnell IB']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK. tlh1g@clinmed.gla.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (CD5 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*CD5 Antigens', 'Female', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Animal', 'Reoperation', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2903 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02903.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jul;114(1):49-56. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02903.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2-5A system is an RNA degradation pathway that is an important mechanistic component of interferon's action against certain viruses. It may also play a role in the anticellular effects of interferon and in general RNA decay. A major player in the 2-5A-system is the latent and constitutive 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease (RNase L) which upon activation by 2-5A, degrades RNA. This RNase L enzyme can be recruited for antisense therapeutics by linking it to an appropriate oligonucleotide targeted to a chosen RNA. Syntheses of 2-5A, its analogues, 2-5A-antisense, and its modifications are detailed herein. Applications of 2-5A-antisense to particular targets such as HIV, PKR, chronic myelogenous leukemia, telomerase, and respiratory syncytical virus are described.","['Adah, S A', 'Bayly, S F', 'Cramer, H', 'Silverman, R H', 'Torrence, P F']","['Adah SA', 'Bayly SF', 'Cramer H', 'Silverman RH', 'Torrence PF']","['Section on Biomedical Chemistry, Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense)', ""61172-40-5 (2',5'-oligoadenylate)"", '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Oligoribonucleotides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA Viruses/*drug effects', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/drug effects', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/0929867013372445 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2001 Aug;8(10):1189-212. doi: 10.2174/0929867013372445.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These hybrids represent a molecular combination of polypyrrole minor groove binders structurally related to the natural antitumor agent distamycin A and two pyrazole analogues of the left-hand segment called cyclopropylpyrroloindole (CPI) of the potent antitumor antibiotic (+)-CC-1065. These novel water-soluble hybrids have been designed to enhance the minor groove binding ability of alkylating units 20 and 21, which should increase their clinical appeal by overcoming the administration problems of (+)-CC-1065 derivatives. The DNA alkylating and cytotoxic activities against several tumor cell lines are reported and discussed in terms of their structural differences in relation to both the number of N-methyl pyrrole rings and the type of the alkylating unit tethered to the oligopeptidic frame. It may be noted that, in general, and especially for 22--24, the cytotoxicity of the hybrids was much greater than that of the alkylating units alone. In only one case, compound 27, did the hybrid have cytotoxic activity comparable to that of the alkylating unit alone against FM3A/0 cells. The broadest spectrum of activity and greatest potency was shown by the hybrid 24, in which the alkylating unit 20 and the deformyl distamycin A are tethered by 1-methyl 2,5-dicarbonyl pyrazole, with IC(50) values for the different tumor cell lines ranging from 7 to 71 nM. For compounds 22--24, the increase of the length of the pseudopeptidic moiety from one to three N-methylpyrrole residues led to an increased cytotoxicity. Among the hybrids tested for their inhibitory effects on the proliferation of murine L1210 leukemia cell line, compound 24 proved to be the most active (IC(50) = 7.4 nM), and in the sequencing gel experiments, it showed the strongest and most highly sequence-specific DNA alkylation activity. For compounds 22-24, the sequence specificity of DNA alkylation appears to be affected by the modification of the number of pyrrole rings, and the correlation between cytotoxicity and alkylation pattern suggests that 24 exerts its cytotoxicity through DNA sequence-specific alkylation of the third adenine located in the sequence 5'-ACAAAAATCG-3'. The two other hybrids 22 and 23 were slightly less active for tumor cell proliferation, with IC(50) values of 58 and 19 nM, respectively. With only one exception, none of the compounds was endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. Compound 24 inhibited the effect of vaccinia virus at a concentration that was significantly lower than its minimum cytotoxic concentration for the E(6)SM host cells. These compounds gave distinct patterns of alkylation in AT-rich sequences, indicating that minor structural changes produced marked alterations in sequence selectivity.","['Baraldi, P G', 'Balboni, G', 'Pavani, M G', 'Spalluto, G', 'Tabrizi, M A', 'Clercq, E D', 'Balzarini, J', 'Bando, T', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Romagnoli, R']","['Baraldi PG', 'Balboni G', 'Pavani MG', 'Spalluto G', 'Tabrizi MA', 'Clercq ED', 'Balzarini J', 'Bando T', 'Sugiyama H', 'Romagnoli R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita di Ferrara, 44100 Ferrara, Italy. pgb@ifeuniv.unife.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0', '(3-(1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-3-(6-(3-methyl-4-chloromethyl-8-', 'hydroxy-4,5-dihydro-6H-pyrrole-(3,2-e)-1H-indazole))carboxypyrazole-5-carboxamido', ')pyrrole-2-carboxamido)pyrrole-2-carboxamido)pyrrole-2-carboxamido)propionamidine', ')', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leucomycins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '69866-21-3 (CC 1065)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Duocarmycins', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Indoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leucomycins/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Pyrazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['jm0108404 [pii]', '10.1021/jm0108404 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 Aug 2;44(16):2536-43. doi: 10.1021/jm0108404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypoxic preconditioning increased the cell survival rate and decreased the lactate dehydrogenase leakage under acute anoxia, in addition to maintaining MMP at a relatively higher level and inducing bcl-2 overexpression during anoxia. The results suggest that hypoxic preconditioning can enhance the tolerance of hypothalamic cells to anoxia, and the underlying mechanism may be related to increased stability of MMP.

In addition, catechol is a major metabolite of carcinogenic benzene. To clarify the carcinogenic mechanism of catechol, we investigated DNA damage using human cultured cell lines and 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human p53 and p16 tumor suppressor genes and the c-Ha-ras-1 proto-oncogene. Catechol increased the amount of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is known to be correlated with the incidence of cancer, in a human leukemia cell line HL-60, whereas the amount of 8-oxodG in its hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-resistant clone HP100 was not increased. The formation of 8-oxodG in calf thymus DNA was increased by catechol in the presence of Cu(2+). Catechol caused damage to 32P-labeled DNA fragments in the presence of Cu(2+). When NADH was added, DNA damage was markedly enhanced and clearly observed at relatively low concentrations of catechol (<1 microM). DNA cleavage was enhanced by piperidine treatment, suggesting that catechol plus NADH caused not only deoxyribose phosphate backbone breakage but also base modification. Catechol plus NADH frequently modified thymine residues. Bathocuproine, a specific Cu(+) chelator and catalase inhibited the DNA damage, indicating the participation of Cu(+) and H2O2 in DNA damage. Typical hydroxyl radical scavengers did not inhibit catechol plus Cu(2+)-induced DNA damage, whereas methional completely inhibited it. These results suggest that reactive species derived from the reaction of H2O2 with Cu(+) participates in catechol-induced DNA damage. Therefore, we conclude that oxidative DNA damage by catechol through the generation of H2O2 plays an important role in the carcinogenic process of catechol and benzene.","['Oikawa, S', 'Hirosawa, I', 'Hirakawa, K', 'Kawanishi, S']","['Oikawa S', 'Hirosawa I', 'Hirakawa K', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Hygiene, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9THP2V94FX (bathocuproine)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'LF3AJ089DQ (catechol)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Catechols/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Copper/pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'NAD/pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/22.8.1239 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2001 Aug;22(8):1239-45. doi: 10.1093/carcin/22.8.1239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis needs several clinical and biological data, but hemogram together with the morphological and immunophenotypic analysis of the lymphoid cells take the major place. If the diagnosis is performed easily in about 65% of the patients, various clinicobiological entities were reported in the past few years that must be identified, at least because some are of adverse prognosis. Moreover, the other chronic lymphoid neoplasms, corresponding to the various low and intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (mainly of follicular type, marginal zone, mantle cell zone), may disseminate within the blood and the bone marrow. Those circulating lymphoma cells must be identified at diagnosis in order to perform the accurate diagnosis and to avoid an erroneous diagnosis of atypical chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Up to 90% of lymphoid malignancies are B cell disorders, contrasting with only a few cases of T cell origin: some of those latter cases cannot be neglected however, as they may be observed in Western countries. Most recent classifications (REAL and WHO) defined all hematological malignancies: each entity referred to clinical, morphological, immunological, cytogenetic, and molecular findings. The basis of these classifications is pathophysiological, trying in each disorder to define a normal counterpart to the pathological clone.

A P-gp inhibitor could not increase PpIX accumulation. Measurement of extracellular PpIX concentration by fluorescence spectrometry showed that P-gp did not mediate the fluorescence kinetics of ALA-induced PpIX production.

Assessment of phototoxicity of PDT using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that PDT was effective in NB4, NB4/MDR, NOMO-1 and NOMO-1/ADR cells, which accumulated high levels of PpIX, but not effective in K562 and K562/ADR cell lines, which accumulated relatively low levels of PpIX.

These included arachinonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3; cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitor), indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), MK-886 (3-[1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-3-t-butyl-thio-5-isopropylindol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl propanoic acid; 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (general lipoxygenase inhibitor), and arachidonic acid itself. Incubation of HL-60 cells with nordihydroguaiaretic acid resulted in apoptosis and it was characterised by mitochondria membrane depolarisation, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol and activation of caspase-3. Indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid synergistically potentiated TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, while arachidonic acid, AACOCF3 and MK-886 did not modulate its effects. Furthermore, indomethacin potentiated apoptosis in cells treated with a differentiating agent, all-trans retinoic acid, which induces resistance to TNF-alpha. However, the observed effects were probably not associated either with the cyclooxygenase- or lipoxygenase-dependent activities of indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, respectively. Since indomethacin may reportedly activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), the effects of specific ligands of PPARs on apoptosis were studied as well. It was found that selective PPARs ligands had no effects on TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. The findings suggest that arachidonic acid metabolism does not play a key role in regulation of apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha in the present model. Nevertheless, our data raise the possibility that indomethacin could potentially be used to improve the treatment of human myeloid leukaemia.","['Vondracek, J', 'Stika, J', 'Soucek, K', 'Minksova, K', 'Blaha, L', 'Hofmanova, J', 'Kozubik, A']","['Vondracek J', 'Stika J', 'Soucek K', 'Minksova K', 'Blaha L', 'Hofmanova J', 'Kozubik A']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferators)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', '86C4MRT55A (pirinixic acid)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U8QXS1WU8G (ciglitazone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/enzymology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Peroxisome Proliferators/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0014299901011244 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(01)01124-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2001 Jul 13;424(1):1-11. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(01)01124-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the pharmacological properties of SDF-1alpha interaction with CXCR4 in human leukemia cell lines. Our data, based on [125I]-SDF-1alpha radioligand binding, SDF-1alpha-induced [35S]-GTPgammaS binding and use of specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 reveals the complex nature of SDF-1alpha-CXCR4 interaction. Firstly, homologous competition with cold SDF-1alpha revealed a bimodal ligand displacement curve and secondly, although AMD3100 inhibited both SDF-1alpha-mediated chemotaxis (IC(50)=4.7 nM) and [35S]-GTPgammaS binding (IC(50)=7.4 nM) with high affinity, it was intriguingly up to 3000-fold less potent (IC(50)=15.2 microM) in the radioligand binding assay. These results provide pharmacological evidence for the recently described two-site model for SDF-1alpha-CXCR4 interaction. Accordingly, inhibition of SDF-1alpha binding to one of the receptor sites is sufficient to antagonize function, without causing its complete displacement from the receptor.

It seems that two binding sites, one interacting with the indole fragment and another with phenyl fragment of the indolylbenzenesulfonamide compounds, are present on the murine cell receptors (colon 38 and P388 leukemia) while only the latter binding site is active on the human KB cell receptors. For the activity against KB cells, a para-methyl or paramethoxy substituent on the phenyl ring of benzenesulfonamide moiety greatly enhances the activity. For the other two activities, a 3-chloro or 3-cyano substituent on indole nucleus enhances activities, while presence of bulkier meta or para substituent on the phenyl ring decreases activities. Presence of an ortho substituent on the phenyl ring appears to be detrimental for all the three activities.

Levels of chromium in soil were above limits considered as safe, although a risk assessment concluded that population exposure was likely to be below occupational levels. As an excess incidence of leukaemia has been suspected in the area, it was decided to investigate a possible relationship between the pollutant and the illness. METHODS: The ensuing study was descriptive-geographical. In the absence of better data, levels of exposure were assumed to decrease with distance from the centre of the polluted area. Leukaemia and population figures were obtained for each of nine concentric rings by aggregation of data available at the Enumeration District level. The null study hypothesis was that relative risk (as measured by Poisson regression) would not follow a definite trend with distance from the centre. Sex, age and levels of deprivation were taken into account. RESULTS: Relative risks by variables other than distance followed previously known patterns for leukaemia. No evident pattern by distance was found. After regroupings inside the variables, a significant excess of leukaemia was found for intermediate distances from the pollutant. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found of a possible relationship between soil pollution by chromium and leukaemia in the general population. Nonetheless, the excess noticed by the study warrants further research.","['Eizaguirre-Garcia, D', 'Rodriguez-Andres, C', 'Watt, G C', 'Hole, D']","['Eizaguirre-Garcia D', 'Rodriguez-Andres C', 'Watt GC', 'Hole D']","['Departamento de Medicina Preventiva y Salud Publica, Facultad de Medicina y Odontologia, Universidad del Pais Vasco, Bilbao, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Public Health Med,Journal of public health medicine,9011205,"['0 (Soil Pollutants)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromium/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Scotland/epidemiology', 'Soil Pollutants/*adverse effects']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/pubmed/21.4.435 [doi]'],ppublish,J Public Health Med. 1999 Dec;21(4):435-8. doi: 10.1093/pubmed/21.4.435.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations constitutively activate the receptor and appear to be associated with a poor prognosis.

In this study, dose-response cytotoxic assays were performed with AG1295, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor active against FLT3, on primary blasts from patients with AML. For each patient sample, the degree of cytotoxicity induced by AG1295 was compared to the response to cytosine arabinoside (Ara C) and correlated with the presence or absence of a FLT3/ITD mutation. AG1295 was specifically cytotoxic to AML blasts harboring FLT3/ITD mutations. The results suggest that these mutations contribute to the leukemic process and that the FLT3 receptor represents a therapeutic target in AML.

Inhibition of topoisomerase IIalpha (topo II) has been implicated in the development of benzene-induced cytogenetic aberrations. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of topo II inhibition by benzene metabolites. In a DNA cleavage/relaxation assay, topo II was inhibited by p-benzoquinone and hydroquinone at 10 microM and 10 mM, respectively. On peroxidase activation, inhibition was seen with 4,4'-biphenol, hydroquinone, and catechol at 10 microM, 10 microM, and 30 microM, respectively. But, in no case was cleavable complex stabilization observed and the metabolites appeared to act at an earlier step of the enzyme cycle. In support of this conclusion, several metabolites antagonized etoposide-stabilized cleavable complex formation and inhibited topo II-DNA binding. It is therefore unlikely that benzene-induced acute myelogenous leukemia stems from events invoked for leukemogenic topo II cleavable complex-stabilizing antitumor agents.

Although it is theoretically possible for p53 dysfunction to arise through mechanisms that do not involve TP53 mutation, such a phenomenon has not previously been demonstrated in a sporadic tumor. Here, we show that p53 dysfunction in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can occur in the absence of TP53 mutation and that such dysfunction is associated with mutation of the gene encoding ATM, a kinase implicated in p53 activation. Forty-three patients with CLL were examined for p53 dysfunction, as detected by impaired up-regulation of p53 and of the p53-dependent protein p21(CIP1/WAF1) after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Thirty (70%) patients had normal p53 responses and underwent progressive IR-induced apoptosis. In 13 (30%) patients, p21 up-regulation was markedly impaired, indicating p53 dysfunction. Six (14%) of these patients with p53 dysfunction had increased baseline levels of p53, were found to have TP53 mutations, and were completely resistant to IR-induced apoptosis. In the other 7 (16%) patients with p53 dysfunction, IR-induced p53 up-regulation and apoptosis were markedly impaired, but baseline levels of p53 were not increased, and no TP53 mutations were detected. Each of these patients was found to have at least one ATM mutation, and a variable reduction in ATM protein was detected in all 4 patients examined. This is the first study to provide a direct demonstration that p53 dysfunction can arise in a sporadic tumor by a mechanism that does not involve TP53 mutation.

Patients with MM typically respond to initial chemotherapies; however, essentially all progress to a chemoresistant state. Factors that contribute to the chemorefractory phenotype include modulation of free radical scavenging, increased expression of drug efflux pumps, and changes in gene expression that allow escape from apoptotic signaling. Recent data indicate that arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) induces remission of refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia and apoptosis of cell lines overexpressing Bcl-2 family members; therefore, it was hypothesized that chemorefractory MM cells would be sensitive to As(2)O(3). As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis in 4 human MM cell lines: 8226/S, 8226/Dox40, U266, and U266/Bcl-x(L). The addition of interleukin-6 had no effect on cell death. Glutathione (GSH) has been implicated as an inhibitor of As(2)O(3)-induced cell death either through conjugating As(2)O(3) or by sequestering reactive oxygen induced by As(2)O(3). Consistent with this possibility, increasing GSH levels with N-acetylcysteine attenuated As(2)O(3) cytotoxicity. Decreases in GSH have been associated with ascorbic acid (AA) metabolism. Clinically relevant doses of AA decreased GSH levels and potentiated As(2)O(3)-mediated cell death of all 4 MM cell lines. Similar results were obtained in freshly isolated human MM cells.

Therefore, the gene expression pattern in lymph node preparations from patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) was compared to the pattern in nonmalignant hyperplastic lymph nodes (HLs). Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed comparing 5 MCLs to 4 HLs using high-density microarrays. The expression data were analyzed using Genespring software. For confirmation, the expression of selected genes was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using the RNA extracted from 16 MCL and 12 HL samples. The focus was on 42 genes that were at least 3-fold down-regulated in MCL; in addition to the B-cell leukemia 2 (BCL2) system other apoptotic pathways were altered in MCL. The FAS-associated via death domain (FADD) gene that acts downstream of the FAS cascade as a key gene to induce apoptosis was more than 10-fold down-regulated in MCL. Furthermore, the death-associated protein 6 (DAXX) gene, the caspase 2 (CASP2) gene, and the RIPK1 domain containing adapter with death domain (RAIDD) gene, which are key genes in other proapoptotic pathways, were also decreased in the MCL samples. The suggestion is made that in addition to the known overexpression of cyclin D1, which drives entry into the cell cycle, disturbances of pathways associated with apoptosis contribute to the development of MCL.

Using Atlas complementary DNA (cDNA) arrays comprising 268 genes coding for intercellular signaling molecules, this study identified genes that are overexpressed in myeloma cells compared to autologous B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. These genes encode the oncogenic Tyro3 tyrosine kinase receptor, the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) that is an epithelial autocrine tumor growth factor, the thrombin receptor (TR) that is linked to HB-EGF and syndecan-1 processing and to cell invasion, chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR2, the Wnt pathway actor Frizzled-related protein (FRZB), and the Notch receptor ligand Jagged 2. These data, obtained with the Atlas cDNA array, were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or protein analysis or both. Furthermore, Tyro3, HB-EGF, TR, and FRZB gene expression was documented in purified primary malignant plasma cells from patients with plasma cell leukemia or MM. HB-EGF and FRZB were poorly expressed in purified polyclonal plasma cells. Finally, HB-EGF was proved to be an essential autocrine growth factor for the XG-1 myeloma cells. This study shows the potency and the biologic relevance of cDNA arrays used to analyze simultaneously a large panel of intercellular signaling genes and, by identifying several genes overexpressed in malignant plasma cells, opens new fields of investigation in MM biology.

The expression of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) complex and its link to the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) molecules in HD cell lines was investigated. Gel retardation and Western blot analyses revealed a high level of constitutively activated STAT3 in 5 of 7 HD cell lines, which could not be detected in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Different levels of IL-6R protein were measured in various HD cell lines: L428 and Dev cells were characterized by very low levels of gp80 and gp130, on KMH2 cells only gp130 but no gp80 was detected, whereas L540, L591, HDLM2, and L1236 were positive for both gp80 and gp130, suggesting a possible autocrine stimulation of STAT3. However, a further increase in STAT3 activation on IL-6 or IL-6/soluble IL-6R stimulation was not observed. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, gp80, gp130, or both receptor subunits did not affect the proliferation or the constitutive activation of STAT molecules in HD cell lines. However, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG490 blocked the constitutive activation of STAT3 and inhibited spontaneous growth of HD tumor cells. The evidence suggests abnormal STAT signaling and growth regulation in Hodgkin cell lines.

It binds DNA as a complex with a broad subset of homeodomain proteins, but its contributions to hematopoiesis have not been established. This paper reports that Pbx1 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors during murine embryonic development and that its absence results in severe anemia and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 15 (E15) or E16. Definitive myeloerythroid lineages are present in Pbx1(-/-) fetal livers, but the total numbers of colony-forming cells are substantially reduced. Fetal liver hypoplasia reflects quantitative as well as qualitative defects in the most primitive multilineage progenitors and their lineage-restricted progeny. Hematopoietic stem cells from Pbx1(-/-) embryos have reduced colony-forming activity and are unable to establish multilineage hematopoiesis in competitive reconstitution experiments. Common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), the earliest known myeloerythroid-restricted progenitors, are markedly depleted in Pbx1(-/-) embryos at E14 and display clonogenic defects in erythroid colony formation. Comparative cell-cycle indexes suggest that these defects result largely from insufficient proliferation. Megakaryocyte- and erythrocyte-committed progenitors are also reduced in number and show decreased erythroid colony-forming potential. Taken together, these data indicate that Pbx1 is essential for the function of hematopoietic progenitors with erythropoietic potential and that its loss creates a proliferative constriction at the level of the CMP. Thus, Pbx1 is required for the maintenance, but not the initiation, of definitive hematopoiesis and contributes to the mitotic amplifications of progenitor subsets through which mature erythrocytes are generated.

TEL-AML1 gene fusion appears to be an initiating event and usually occurs before birth, in utero. This subgroup of ALL generally presents with low- or medium-risk features and overall has a very good prognosis. Some patients, however, do have relapses late or after the cessation of treatment, at least on some therapeutic protocols. They usually achieve sustained second remissions. Posttreatment relapses, or even very late relapses (5-20 years after diagnosis), in childhood ALL are clonally related to the leukemic cells at diagnosis (by IGH or T-cell receptor [TCR] gene sequencing) and are considered, therefore, to represent a slow re-emergence or escape of the initial clone seen at diagnosis. Microsatellite markers and fluorescence in situ hybridization identified deletions of the unrearranged TEL allele and IGH/TCR gene rearrangements were analyzed; the results show that posttreatment relapse cells in 2 patients with TEL-AML1-positive ALL were not derived from the dominant clone present at diagnosis but were from a sibling clone. In contrast, a patient who had a relapse while on treatment with TEL-AML1 fusion had essentially the same TEL deletion, though with evidence for microsatellite instability 5(') of TEL gene deletion at diagnosis, leading to extended 5(') deletion at relapse. It is speculated that, in some patients, combination chemotherapy for childhood ALL may fail to eliminate a fetal preleukemic clone with TEL-AML1 and that a second, independent transformation event within this clone after treatment gives rise to a new leukemia masquerading as relapse.

Three hundred eighty-eight patients (60 years of age and older) with newly diagnosed de novo AML were randomly assigned to receive placebo (P) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or GM in a double-blind manner, beginning 1 day after the completion of 3 days of daunorubicin and 7 days of cytarabine therapy. No differences were found in the rates of leukemic regrowth, CR, or infectious complications in either arm. Of 205 patients who achieved CR, 169 were medically well and were randomized to receive cytarabine alone or a combination of cytarabine and mitoxantrone. With a median follow-up of 7.7 years, the median disease-free survival times were 11 months and 10 months for those randomized to cytarabine or cytarabine/mitoxantrone, respectively. Rates of relapse, excluding deaths in CR, were 77% for cytarabine and 82% for cytarabine/mitoxantrone. Induction randomization had no effect on leukemic relapse rate or remission duration in either postremission arm. Because cytarabine/mitoxantrone was more toxic and no more effective than cytarabine, it was concluded that this higher-dose therapy had no benefit in the postremission management of older patients with de novo AML. These results suggest the need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for these patients.

Optimal responses may require the modification of the tumor cells not only to increase their immunogenicity but also to improve their ability to recruit effector cells to the tumor sites or sites of tumor antigen exposure. It has been reported that CD40 cross-linking of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells significantly increases their immunogenicity and allows the generation and expansion of autologous antileukemia cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This study demonstrates that the CD40 ligation of these tumor cells also induces the secretion of the CC-chemokines MDC and TARC. Supernatants from malignant cells cultured in the presence of sCD40L promote the migration of activated T cells that express CCR4, the common specific receptor for MDC and TARC. More importantly, the supernatants from CD40-stimulated tumor cells also support the transendothelial migration of autologous CCR4(+) antileukemia T cells. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the delivery to leukemia cells of a single physiologic signal, that is, CD40 cross-linking, simultaneously improves tumor cell immunogenicity and induces potent chemoattraction for T cells.

Recent licensing of thrombopoietin for clinical use may have a profound effect on the very high current demand for platelet transfusions. Gene therapy protocols for the treatment of haemophilias and other coagulation disorders, and the production of recombinant blood products may reshape the demand for clotting factors from human plasma. I also consider the potential impact of the exciting technologies of DNA arraying and nucleic acid therapeutics in the fields of molecular diagnostics and the possible treatment of leukemia respectively.","['Avent, N D']",['Avent ND'],"['University of the West of England, Frenchay, Bristol, UK. neil.avent@uwe.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,['0 (Recombinant Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Humans', '*Protein Engineering', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1389201003378951 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2000 Sep;1(2):117-35. doi: 10.2174/1389201003378951.,,,,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports of RSV infection among children with primary and acquired immunodeficiencies describe increased morbidity compared with that seen in immunocompetent children, but there have been few reports describing the outcome of RSV infection specifically among pediatric oncology patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all children being treated by the Pediatric Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who had positive tests for RSV between the Fall of 1994 and the Spring of 1998. Patients on the BMT Service were excluded from this analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen RSV infections were identified among pediatric oncology patients, who were being treated with aggressive, predominantly alkylator-based chemotherapy for a variety of oncologic diagnoses. Nine episodes of RSV infection (50%) were treated with specific antiviral therapy. Only one death less than 100 days from the diagnosis of RSV infection occurred among these 18 patients and was attributed to progressive leukemia. The remaining patients recovered fully, although three were readmitted with respiratory symptoms within two weeks of discharge. Seven patients had concurrent infection with other pathogenic organisms. CONCLUSIONS: In striking contrast with the outcome of RSV infection in adult oncology patients, there may be low mortality associated with RSV infection in pediatric oncology patients. It is possible that scheduled anti-neoplastic therapy need not be delayed for these patients when the diagnosis of RSV infection is made.","['Cole, P D', 'Suh, J S', 'Onel, K', 'Stiles, J', 'Armstrong, D', 'Dunkel, I J']","['Cole PD', 'Suh JS', 'Onel K', 'Stiles J', 'Armstrong D', 'Dunkel IJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901, USA. colepd@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/07/24 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.1158 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Jul;37(1):24-9. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1158.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to estimate the risk for PCP during maintenance treatment (MT) to identify patients at risk who could benefit from prophylaxis. PROCEDURE: We registered all episodes of PCP during MT in 71 children diagnosed between January 1992 and June 1997 with non-B-cell ALL at The Copenhagen University Hospital. Sulphametoxazole and trimetroprim (SMX/TMP) prophylaxis against PCP was given during induction and consolidation therapy but stopped prior to MT with oral methotrexate/6-mercaptopurine. Patients with standard (SR), intermediate (IR), and high risk (HR) ALL started MT at 3, 8, and 15 months from diagnosis, respectively. RESULTS: The HR group had a cumulated risk of 70% for developing PCP, whereas the risk for PCP in children with IR and the SR was 11 and 8%, respectively (P < 0.0001). All but one of these 13 cases of PCP occurred within 8 months after cessation of SMX-TMP prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The higher incidence of PCP among HR compared to non-HR patients following cessation of SMX/TMP prophylaxis probably reflects the significantly longer T-cell suppressive consolidation therapy in this group. The very low incidence of PCP during the later part of MT emphasizes that methotrexate/6-mercaptopurine MT have more impact on B-cell than on T-cell function. TMP/SMX prophylaxis should be recommended for all children treated for ALL.","['Poulsen, A', 'Demeny, A K', 'Bang Plum, C', 'Gjerum Nielsen, K', 'Schmiegelow, K']","['Poulsen A', 'Demeny AK', 'Bang Plum C', 'Gjerum Nielsen K', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Clinic II, The Juliane Marie Center, The Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Risk', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/administration & dosage']",2001/07/24 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.1157 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Jul;37(1):20-3. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1157.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, all children with ALL were classified into three groups and treated with a new regimen (AL90). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 1996, 220 children with ALL, treated with the AL90 regimen, were classified into three risk groups: low, intermediate, and high: LR, IR, and HR, respectively. The protocol consisted of three- to five-drug induction, consolidation with intermediate-dose methotrexate and/or cytarabine, mercaptopurine and cyclophosphamide, four-drug intensification, and sequential maintenance therapies. Only intrathecal chemotherapy was used for CNS prophylaxis in the LR group, whereas cranial irradiation was added for the IR and HR groups. RESULTS: The number of eligible patients was 91: LR group, 71: IR group, and 58: HR group. Complete remission (CR) was obtained in > 98% of the LR and IR groups, while only 88% achieved CR in the HR group. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 67.4% in all patients: 70.4% in the LR group, 71.7% in the IR group, and 57.5% in the HR group. With respect to the previous study, EFS in the HR group who showed positive residual leukemia at 14 days was improved, whereas EFS in boys versus girls was significantly lower (48.8% : 85.7%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk ALL, the rate of induction failure was high and boys had a worse outcome, calling for improvements in induction therapy and a specific approach for boys.","['Ishii, E', 'Eguchi, H', 'Matsuzaki, A', 'Koga, H', 'Yanai, F', 'Kuroda, H', 'Kawakami, K', 'Ayukawa, H', 'Akiyoshi, K', 'Kamizono, J', 'Tamai, Y', 'Kinukawa, N', 'Okamura, J']","['Ishii E', 'Eguchi H', 'Matsuzaki A', 'Koga H', 'Yanai F', 'Kuroda H', 'Kawakami K', 'Ayukawa H', 'Akiyoshi K', 'Kamizono J', 'Tamai Y', 'Kinukawa N', 'Okamura J']","['Division of Pediatrics, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.

Mylotarg is associated with an incidence of approximately 20% Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia and liver transaminitis in this patient population. Hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD) has been reported in patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT) after Mylotarg therapy. Outside of the SCT setting, VOD has been associated very rarely with cytotoxic therapy. METHODS: The authors assessed the incidence of VOD in 119 patients who were receiving Mylotarg-containing non-SCT regimens. VOD was diagnosed through the use of standard Seattle and Baltimore criteria. RESULTS: A cohort of 119 (61 previously untreated, 58 with relapsed disease) patients with AML (92 patients), advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (25 patients), or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase (2 patients), received Mylotarg-based regimens. Fourteen (12%) developed VOD. The diagnosis of VOD was supported by histology in 2 patients and radiologic studies in a further 10 patients. Five (36%) of 14 patients with VOD had received no prior antileukemic cytotoxic therapy, including 2 patients who received single-agent Mylotarg therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Mylotarg was shown to be associated with the development of potentially fatal VOD in patients with leukemia who had not received SCT. VOD occurred when Mylotarg was used either as a single agent or when it was given with other cytotoxic agents. VOD occurred in Mylotarg-treated patients who had received no prior cytotoxic therapy. The current study concluded that risk factors for VOD should be assessed when considering Mylotarg therapy, and that attempts to avoid and treat VOD are warranted in patients who receive Mylotarg therapy.","['Giles, F J', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Thomas, D A', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Waddelow, T A', 'David, C L', 'Phan, A T', 'Colburn, D E', 'Rashid, A', 'Estey, E H']","['Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Kornblau SM', 'Thomas DA', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Waddelow TA', 'David CL', 'Phan AT', 'Colburn DE', 'Rashid A', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: Eligibility criteria included histologically documented, diffuse small cleaved, diffuse mixed, diffuse large cell, or immunoblastic lymphoma, Stage III--IV or bulky Stage II disease, and an ECOG performance status of 0--1. CALGB 8852, a group-wide study, accrued 227 patients: 120 patients in the pilot study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) without G-CSF and 107 in the pilot study of dose-escalated CHOPE with G-CSF. CALGB 8854, a limited-institution, Phase I study, enrolled 38 patients and determined the MTD of CHOPE with G-CSF to be used in CALGB 8852. The MTD in both studies was defined as the dose at which 50% of patients had 1) Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting 7 days or more, or 2) Grade 3--4 hemorrhage or nonhematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia, nausea, and emesis), or 3) were prevented from receiving 100% of drug on Day 22. RESULTS: The MTD of CHOPE without G-CSF was cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m(2) on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m(2) on Days 1--3 with doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) on Day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) (maximum, 2 mg) on Day 1, and prednisone 100 mg on Days 1--5. With the addition of G-CSF at 200 microg/m(2) on Days 5--19, the MTD was cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m(2) and etoposide 160 mg/m(2) on Days 1-3 with standard doses of doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Increasing the dose of G-CSF from 200 microg/m(2) to 400 microg/m(2) did not allow for further dose escalation. The primary toxicity in all cohorts was neutropenia. Four toxic deaths occurred on CALGB 8852. The 5-year failure free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for eligible patients on CALGB 8852 were 31% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 23--39) and 48% (95%CI, 40--57), respectively. The 5-year FFS and OS rates for eligible patients on CALGB 8854 were 34% (95%CI, 17--52) and 51% (95%CI, 33--70), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate dose escalation with G-CSF is feasible.

Transgenic expression of Lmo2 in T cells results in clonal tumours with long latency indicating that mutations in other genes are required for the development of overt tumours. RAG V-D-J recombinase can mediate genetic transposition and thus might create the secondary mutations necessary for T-ALL. Tumour development was compared in Lmo2 transgenic mice in the presence or absence of the Rag1 gene. No difference was observed in the rate of tumour formation nor in tumour histology in Lmo2-transgenic mice with or without Rag1. We conclude that, in this model, RAG recombinase is not a major mediator of mutations needed for T cell tumorigenesis and that antigen binding to alpha-beta or to gamma-delta T cell receptor does not play a role in tumorigenesis.

METHODS: The release of collagen and proteoglycan was assessed in bovine and human cartilage explant cultures. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein production from immortalized human chondrocytes (T/C28a4) was analyzed by Northern blotting and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Collagenase activity was measured by bioassay. Cell surface receptors were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: OSM in combination with IL-1alpha caused a rapid synergistic induction of matrix metalloproteinase 1 mRNA, which was sustained over a 72-hour period. Flow cytometric analyses detected both the OSM-specific receptor and the gp130 receptor at the chondrocyte cell surface, but failed to detect the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Cartilage degradation assays revealed that, of the gp130 binding cytokines, only OSM and IL-6, in the presence of its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), were able to act synergistically with IL-1alpha to promote collagen release. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-6 can mimic OSM in synergizing with IL-1alpha to induce chondrocyte-mediated cartilage collagen breakdown and collagenase production. In order to have this effect, IL-6 requires the presence of its soluble receptor. The apparent absence of LIFR explains why other gp130 binding cytokines do not act in synergy with IL-1alpha. Since OSM, IL-6, and sIL-6R levels have all been shown to be elevated in the rheumatoid joint, our findings suggest that these cytokines may be key mediators of cartilage collagen catabolism in the inflammatory arthritides.","['Rowan, A D', 'Koshy, P J', 'Shingleton, W D', 'Degnan, B A', 'Heath, J K', 'Vernallis, A B', 'Spaull, J R', 'Life, P F', 'Hudson, K', 'Cawston, T E']","['Rowan AD', 'Koshy PJ', 'Shingleton WD', 'Degnan BA', 'Heath JK', 'Vernallis AB', 'Spaull JR', 'Life PF', 'Hudson K', 'Cawston TE']","['Rheumatology, School of Clinical Medical Sciences, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 3.4.24.7 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cartilage, Articular/cytology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/genetics/metabolism']",2001/07/24 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(200107)44:7<1620::AID-ART285>3.0.CO;2-B [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2001 Jul;44(7):1620-32. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(200107)44:7<1620::AID-ART285>3.0.CO;2-B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients that become severely immunocompromised because of underlying diseases such as leukemia or recently, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or patients who undergo cancer chemotherapy or organ transplantation, are particularly susceptible to opportunistic fungal infections. Although Candida species continue to be the major pathogenic fungi in these patients, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, and coccidioidomycosis, among others, have become increasingly important mycoses. Antifungal drugs currently being used in clinic include polyene antibiotics, azole derivatives and 5-fluorocytosine. With the exception of the latter, all other drugs possess mechanisms of action aimed at disrupting the integrity of the fungal cell membrane by either interfering with the biosynthesis of membrane sterols or by inhibiting sterol functions. However, one significant obstacle preventing successful antifungal therapy is the dramatic increase in drug resistance, especially against azole antimycotics. Among the major mechanisms by which fungi invoke drug resistance is the overexpession of extrusion pumps able to facilitate the efflux of cytotoxic drugs from the cell thus leading to decreased drug accumulation and diminished concentrations. Since the initial observations that azole resistance by fungi may be caused by overexpression of multidrug efflux transporter genes, significant advances have been achieved primarily with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. The purpose of this review is to discuss various aspects of multidrug resistance in fungi such as antifungal drug mechanisms of action and fungal molecular genetics in the context of targeted drug discovery. The role that membrane transporter proteins play in drug resistance in various species of Candida, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus will be address in more detail, as will be their importance as selective drug targets in the design of novel antifungal agents.","['St Georgiev, V']",['St Georgiev V'],"['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. vg8q@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Azoles)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*drug effects/metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Azoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Candida albicans/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Humans']",2001/07/24 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1389450003349209 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2000 Nov;1(3):261-84. doi: 10.2174/1389450003349209.,,,,,268,,,,,,,,,,,,

This highlights the importance of alertness to the possibility of parvovirus infection in children with cancer.","['McNall, R Y', 'Head, D R', 'Pui, C H', 'Razzouk, B I']","['McNall RY', 'Head DR', 'Pui CH', 'Razzouk BI']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*etiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Parvoviridae Infections/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/07/24 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200106000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2001 Jun-Jul;23(5):309-11. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200106000-00015.,,,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated, in a phase II trial, the role of a low-dose (550 cGy) high-dose rate (35 cGy/min) single-exposure total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimen for allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in patients with CML. Between June 1997 and August 2000, 30 adult patients with CML underwent cytokine-mobilized allogeneic PBSC transplantation from HLA-matched siblings following administration of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg per day intravenously on days -2 and -1) and single-dose TBI (550 cGy delivered at 30 cGy/min on day 0). Cyclosporine A alone was administered for prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Median patient age was 47 years (range, 21-63 years), with 23 patients (77%) older than 40 years. The preparative regimen was well tolerated. Grade 4 toxicities and oral mucositis were not observed. Graft failure did not occur. Severe acute GVHD was observed in 5 patients (17%). The median follow-up was 23 months (range, 6-39 months). Cytogenetic or hematologic relapse was detected in 3 patients (10%), 2 of whom subsequently entered remission following a taper of immunosuppression. Nonrelapse mortality occurred in 5 patients (17%), and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 2 years was 83% (95% confidence interval, 70%-97%). In summary, this low-dose TBI-based preparative regimen resulted in uniform donor engraftment, with markedly reduced organ toxicity and nonrelapse mortality, in this relatively older cohort of patients with CML.","['Khoury, H', 'Adkins, D', 'Brown, R', 'Pence, H', 'Vij, R', 'Goodnough, L T', 'Westervelt, P', 'Trinkaus, K', 'Lin, H S', 'DiPersio, Y']","['Khoury H', 'Adkins D', 'Brown R', 'Pence H', 'Vij R', 'Goodnough LT', 'Westervelt P', 'Trinkaus K', 'Lin HS', 'DiPersio Y']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia Section, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110-1093, USA. hkhoury@imgate.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Combined Modality Therapy/mortality', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*standards']",2001/07/24 10:00,2002/02/08 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879101500130 [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(01)80006-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2001;7(6):352-8. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(01)80006-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (mean age = 8.92 years) and 36 parents completed measures of QOL when attending routine clinic. In addition, parents also completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), perception of the child's vulnerability, and illness-related stressors. Significant correlations were found between the overall scores on the two child-completed QOL measures, with a range of poor, moderate to good correlations found between the individual subscales. Poor to moderate concordance was found between child and parent reports. Children who self-reported poorer QOL had mothers who were more depressed. Parents who reported poorer QOL for their child reported more illness stressors and perceived their child as being more vulnerable. Assumptions that concordance between child and parent ratings of QOL is a necessary requirement for new measures of QOL are challenged.","['Vance, Y H', 'Morse, R C', 'Jenney, M E', 'Eiser, C']","['Vance YH', 'Morse RC', 'Jenney ME', 'Eiser C']","['Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, UK.

We asked whether catecholamine metabolites, mIBG scan, and bone marrow evaluation might be relevant response markers in disseminated neuroblastoma. PROCEDURE: Three hundred sixty-seven unselected stage 4 neuroblastoma patients treated according the German cooperative trial NB90 were entered into the study. Catecholamine plasma and urine levels were centrally determined by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Bone marrow cytology and mIBG scans were evaluated by local investigators. RESULTS: At diagnosis, mIBG scan was positive in 306 patients (92%), borderline in seven patients (2%), and negative in 19 patients (6%). Bone marrow aspirates were cytologically positive in 292 patients (84%) and negative in 57 patients (16%). Plasma catecholamine levels were elevated in 79% (206 of 260 patients.), urinary levels in 91% (307 of 338 patients). The outcome of patients with normalized mIBG scan after four courses of chemotherapy [5 year EFS (event free survival) 0.22 +/- 0.07] was not superior to the outcome of patients with still abnormal uptake (5 year EFS 0.30 +/- 0.05). The event free survival of patients with still positive bone marrow aspirates after four courses (0.16 +/- 0.06) was inferior to the EFS of patients with negative bone marrow aspirates (0.26 +/- 0.04, P = 0.0054). Urinary catecholamine normalization after four cycles of chemotherapy (5 year EFS 0.35 +/- 0.06 versus 0.26 +/- 0.10) had no influence on outcome, whereas plasma catecholamine normalization after the first (5 year EFS 0.40 +/- 0.09 versus 0.14 +/- 0.07, P= 0.0364) or the fourth cycle (5 year EFS 0.35 +/- 0.06 versus 0.26 +/- 0.10, P = 0.0242) indicated a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that serial plasma catecholamine levels and bone marrow aspirates in the course of the disease are useful tools in predicting outcome.","['Hero, B', 'Hunneman, D H', 'Gahr, M', 'Berthold, F']","['Hero B', 'Hunneman DH', 'Gahr M', 'Berthold F']","[""Children's Hospital of the University of Cologne, Koln, Germany. barbara.hero@medizin.uni-koeln.de""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)', '55-10-7 (Vanilmandelic Acid)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'X77S6GMS36 (Homovanillic Acid)']",IM,"['*3-Iodobenzylguanidine', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood/urine', '*Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Homovanillic Acid/*analysis/blood/urine', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', '*Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Life Tables', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Radionuclide Imaging', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vanilmandelic Acid/*analysis/blood/urine', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",2001/07/24 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1096-911X(20010101)36:1<220::AID-MPO1053>3.0.CO;2-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Jan;36(1):220-3. doi: 10.1002/1096-911X(20010101)36:1<220::AID-MPO1053>3.0.CO;2-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For signal transduction, CNTF requires a receptor complex, composed of the IL-6 signal transducing molecule gp130, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)-beta, and CNTFR-alpha. There are two major independent pathways (Jak-STAT and Ras-MAPK) in cell signaling, and some recent reports show interaction between these pathways. The signal of the IL-6 family is mainly transduced to the Jak-STAT pathway through gp130. However, it has not been examined in neuroblastoma in detail. PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: Here we examine the signaling pathway of CNTF in 11 neuroblastoma cell lines. Northern blot analysis revealed that 3 of the 11 cell lines expressed c-fos mRNA after CNTF stimulation. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated antiphosphotyrosine antibody and blotted with anti-gp130, anti-Jak1, or anti-STAT3 antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, Jak1, and STAT3 was observed after CNTF stimulation in these three cell lines. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 (one of the MAPKs) was also observed in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CNTF signaling is conserved in some of the neuroblastoma cell lines and suggest that not only a Jak-STAT pathway but a MAPK pathway is activated by CNTF through gp130 in neuroblastoma cell lines.","['Kuroda, H', 'Sugimoto, T', 'Horii, Y', 'Sawada, T']","['Kuroda H', 'Sugimoto T', 'Horii Y', 'Sawada T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Miyazaki Medical College, Japan. kurodah@post.miyazaki-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, fos', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",2001/07/24 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/24 10:00'],"['2001/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1096-911X(20010101)36:1<118::AID-MPO1028>3.0.CO;2-R [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Jan;36(1):118-21. doi: 10.1002/1096-911X(20010101)36:1<118::AID-MPO1028>3.0.CO;2-R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify such candidate genes, 65 human myeloid cell line DNAs were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for evidence of allelic loss at 39 highly polymorphic loci on the long arm of chromosome 20. A mono-allelic pattern was present in eight cell lines at multiple adjacent loci spanning the common deleted regions (CDRs) previously defined in primary hematological samples, suggesting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 20q. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was then performed using a series of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) ordered in the CDR, and in five of eight cell lines, the deletions resulted from cytogenetically detectable whole chromosomal loss or large interstitial deletion, whereas in another cell line deletion was associated with an unbalanced translocation. LOH in the CMK megakaryocytic cell line, which has a hypotetraploid karyotype, was associated with a der(20)t(1;20)(q32;q12)x2 leading to complete deletion of the CDR. Three additional unbalanced translocations were found within the CDR and all three breakpoints mapped to a single YAC. We then used a series of P1 artificial chromosomes (PACs) spanning this YAC clone, and two PACs produced 'split' signals suggesting that they each span one of these breakpoints. Exon trapping using PACs that overlap the breakpoint regions yielded portions of six genes and evaluation of these genes as candidate tumor suppressor genes is underway. The limited information available about these genes suggests that the h-l(3)mbt gene is the most attractive candidate.","['MacGrogan, D', 'Alvarez, S', 'DeBlasio, T', 'Jhanwar, S C', 'Nimer, S D']","['MacGrogan D', 'Alvarez S', 'DeBlasio T', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosome Fragility', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/21 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/21 10:00'],"['2000/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2001/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2001/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204540 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jul 12;20(31):4150-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204540.,,,,['R01DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significantly, the general caspase inhibitor Boc-FMK did not block the release of cytochrome c, whereas it did block cleavage of BID and the loss of Deltapsi(m). Neither FP-induced apoptosis nor cytochrome c release was inhibited by the pharmacological caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-FMK or endogenous expression of viral caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA. Finally, FP-mediated apoptosis, but not cytochrome c release, was partially blocked by the free radical scavenger LNAC.

When oxidized to its dimeric form (pEEDCK)2, it activates growth of hematopoietic progenitors in association with stroma-derived cytokines. (pEEDCK)2 has a Cys-Cys motif which is also a typical feature of the macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1alpha). The present study was designed to analyze differences between the response of normal and leukemic progenitor cells to (pEEDCK)2 or MIP-1alpha. When long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) were incubated with (pEEDCK)2 or MIP-1alpha and/or cytokines, the stimulatory effect on colony-forming units-granulocyte/erythroid/macrophage/megakaryocyte of LTBMC from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients was less than 50% compared to LTBMC from healthy humans. No difference in oncogene expression could be observed in LTBMC from CML patients regarding reduction of Philadelphia chromosome-associated transcription of the BCR-ABL gene. With respect to the expression of growth and differentiation-associated genes (Galpha16, 5-lipoxygenase, phospholipaseA2, c-kit, and CD34), which were analyzed from LTBMC by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the same transcription rate was observed in CML patients and healthy donors. However, two isoforms of a key enzyme of oxidative metabolism, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1A and CPT1B), showed 50-fold higher expression rates in LTBMC cells of healthy donors compared to CML patients. It is known that a decrease in oxidative metabolism is associated with an increase in redox equivalents in malignancy. This might result in a reduction of disulphide bonds in (pEEDCK)2 or MIP-1alpha, thus inducing a downregulation of these factors in bone marrow from CML patients.","['Karlic, H', 'Louda, N', 'Pfeilstocker, M', 'Keil, F', 'Lohninger, A', 'Pittermann, E', 'Paukovits, J']","['Karlic H', 'Louda N', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Keil F', 'Lohninger A', 'Pittermann E', 'Paukovits J']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria. heidrum.karlic@chello.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '84588-89-6 (hemoregulatory peptide 5b)', 'SZB83O1W42 (Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid/analogs & derivatives']",2001/07/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/21 10:00'],"['2001/07/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.19-4-321 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2001;19(4):321-8. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.19-4-321.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hGR 1Ap/e sequence is approximately 31 kbp upstream of the human GR coding sequence. This sequence (2,056 bp) contains a novel promoter (the hGR 1A promoter; 1,075 bp) and untranslated exon sequence (hGR exon 1A sequence; 981 bp). Alternative splicing produces three different hGR 1A-containing transcripts, 1A1, 1A2, and 1A3. GR transcripts containing exon 1A1, 1A2, 1B, and 1C are expressed at various levels in many cancer cell lines, while the exon 1A3-containing GR transcript is expressed most abundantly in blood cell cancer cell lines. Glucocorticoid hormone treatment causes an up-regulation of exon 1A3-containing GR transcripts in CEM-C7 T-lymphoblast cells and a down-regulation of exon 1A3-containing transcripts in IM-9 B-lymphoma cells. Deoxyribonuclease I footprinting using CEM-C7 cell nuclear extract reveals four footprints in the promoter region and two intraexonic footprints. Much of the basal promoter-activating function is found in the +41/+269 sequence, which contains two deoxyribonuclease I footprints (FP5 and FP6). When this sequence is cloned into the pXP-1 luciferase reporter gene, hormone treatment causes a significant increase in luciferase activity in Jurkat T cells that are cotransfected with a GR expression vector. FP5 is an interferon regulatory factor-binding element, and it contributes significantly to basal transcription rate, but it is not activated by steroid. FP6 resembles a glucocorticoid response element and can bind GRbeta. This novel hGR 1Ap/e sequence may have future applications for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of T-cell leukemia and lymphoma.","['Breslin, M B', 'Geng, C D', 'Vedeckis, W V']","['Breslin MB', 'Geng CD', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Stanley S.

ELL is an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that interacts with the recently identified EAF1 (ELL associated factor 1) protein. EAF1 contains a limited region of homology with the transcriptional activation domains of three other genes fused to MLL in leukemias, AF4, LAF4, and AF5q31. Using an in vitro transformation assay of retrovirally transduced myeloid progenitors, we conducted a structure-function analysis of MLL-ELL. Whereas the elongation domain of ELL was dispensable, the EAF1 interaction domain of ELL was critical to the immortalizing properties of MLL-ELL in vitro. To confirm these results in vivo, we transplanted mice with bone marrow transduced with MLL fused to the minimal EAF1 interaction domain of ELL. These mice all developed AML, with a longer latency than mice transplanted with the wild-type MLL-ELL fusion. Based on these results, we generated a heterologous MLL-EAF1 fusion gene and analyzed its transforming potential. Strikingly, we found that MLL-EAF1 immortalized myeloid progenitors in the same manner as that of MLL-ELL. Furthermore, transplantation of bone marrow transduced with MLL-EAF1 induced AML with a shorter latency than mice transplanted with the MLL-ELL fusion. Taken together, these results indicate that the leukemic activity of MLL-ELL requires the EAF1 interaction domain of ELL, suggesting that the recruitment by MLL of a transactivation domain similar to that in EAF1 or the AF4/LAF4/AF5q31 family may be a critical common feature of multiple 11q23 translocations. In addition, these studies support a critical role for MLL partner genes and their protein-protein interactions in 11q23 leukemogenesis.","['Luo, R T', 'Lavau, C', 'Du, C', 'Simone, F', 'Polak, P E', 'Kawamata, S', 'Thirman, M J']","['Luo RT', 'Lavau C', 'Du C', 'Simone F', 'Polak PE', 'Kawamata S', 'Thirman MJ']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EAF1 protein, human)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', '*Peptide Elongation Factors', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",2001/07/21 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/21 10:00'],"['2001/07/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.16.5678-5687.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Aug;21(16):5678-87. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.16.5678-5687.2001.,PMC87288,,,"['R01 CA078431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The postnatal viability of homozygous mutants was greatly reduced. In approximately 25% the midgut was missing, whereas practically all pups surviving past the first 2 days showed severe growth impairment, which was likely due to a gross disruption of the gut architecture. The latter phenotype could be traced back to late embryonic development. No difference in gut cell differentiation or proliferation was found compared to wild-type littermates. Levels of factors known to be involved in gut morphogenesis were also unchanged. MTG8 is expressed in the outermost layers of the developing gut from at least E9.5.

To investigate the impact of AML1-ETO on hematopoiesis, tetracycline-inducible AML1-ETO-expressing cell lines were generated using myeloid cells. AML1-ETO is tightly and strongly induced upon tetracycline withdrawal. The proliferation of AML1-ETO(+) cells was markedly reduced, and most of the cells eventually underwent apoptosis. RNase protection assays revealed that the amount of Bcl-2 mRNA was decreased after AML1-ETO induction. Enforced expression of Bcl-2 was able to significantly delay, but not completely overcome, AML1-ETO-induced apoptosis. Prior to the onset of apoptosis, we also studied the ability of AML1-ETO to modulate differentiation. AML1-ETO expression altered granulocytic differentiation of U937T-A/E cells. More significantly, this change of differentiation was associated with the down-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a key regulator of granulocytic differentiation. These observations suggest a dichotomy in the functions of AML1-ETO: (i) reduction of granulocytic differentiation correlated with decreased expression of C/EBPalpha and (ii) growth arrest leading to apoptosis with decreased expression of CDK4, c-myc, and Bcl-2.

To activate HTLV-1 transcription Tax interacts with the cellular protein CREB and the pleiotropic coactivators CBP and p300. While extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms of Tax transcription function and coactivator utilization are not fully understood. Previous studies have focused on Tax binding to the KIX domain of CBP, as this was believed to be the key step in recruiting the coactivator to the HTLV-1 promoter. In this study, we identify a carboxy-terminal region of CBP (and p300) that strongly interacts with Tax and mediates Tax transcription function. Through deletion mutagenesis, we identify amino acids 2003 to 2212 of CBP, which we call carboxy-terminal region 2 (CR2), as the minimal region for Tax interaction. Interestingly, this domain corresponds to the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1)-interacting domain of CBP. We show that a double point mutant targeted to one of the putative alpha-helical motifs in this domain significantly compromises the interaction with Tax. We also characterize the region of Tax responsible for interaction with CR2 and show that the previously identified transactivation domain of Tax (amino acids 312 to 319) participates in CR2 binding. This region of Tax corresponds to a consensus amphipathic helix, and single point mutations targeted to amino acids on the face of this helix abolish interaction with CR2 and dramatically reduce Tax transcription function. Finally, we demonstrate that Tax and SRC-1 bind to CR2 in a mutually exclusive fashion. Together, these studies identify a novel Tax-interacting site on CBP/p300 and extend our understanding of the molecular mechanism of Tax transactivation.","['Scoggin, K E', 'Ulloa, A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Scoggin KE', 'Ulloa A', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (NCOA1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ncoa1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Escherichia coli', '*Genes, pX', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2001/07/21 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/21 10:00'],"['2001/07/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.16.5520-5530.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Aug;21(16):5520-30. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.16.5520-5530.2001.,PMC87274,,,"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since bile acids are major excretion products of cholesterol, the hepatic degradation of cholesterol to bile acids was investigated in AML patients by analyzing a circulating marker for bile acid synthesis. In addition, plasma levels of a marker for cholesterol synthesis were determined. The plasma levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, reflecting bile acid production, were markedly lower in patients with AML than in healthy controls. The median levels were 3.3 and 18.5ng/ml (P<0.0001) in the AML patients (n=29) and the healthy subjects (n=16), respectively. The plasma levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol, reflecting hepatic cholesterol synthesis, were similar for the AML patients and the controls. The results show that the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids was suppressed in AML patients, a phenomenon that may result in a decreased intestinal absorption of cholesterol and subsequent hypocholesterolemia.","['Tatidis, L', 'Vitols, S', 'Gruber, A', 'Paul, C', 'Axelson, M']","['Tatidis L', 'Vitols S', 'Gruber A', 'Paul C', 'Axelson M']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute and Hospital, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. lota@mb.ks.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cholestenones)', '0 (Dehydrocholesterols)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '3862-25-7 (7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'BK1IU07GKF (7-dehydrocholesterol)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Bile Acids and Salts/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cholestenones/blood', 'Cholesterol/*blood/metabolism', 'Dehydrocholesterols/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/07/21 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/21 10:00'],"['2001/07/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383501005924 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00592-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2001 Sep 20;170(2):169-75. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00592-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied densely infiltrated splenic tissue of 14 cases of HCL for the presence of chromosomal gains and losses by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Chromosomal imbalances were detected in only four of the 14 cases. Chromosomal gains involved the regions 5q13-q31 (two cases) and 1p32-p36.2 (one case). A loss of the region 11q14-q22 was found in one additional patient. The imbalances affecting the regions 5q and 11q were confirmed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using PAC clone 144G9 (5q31) and YAC clones 755B11 (11q22.3-q23.1) and 801E11 (11q22.3-q23.1 spanning the ATM gene) and occurred in 61% to 75% of analyzed nuclei.

We conclude that overrepresentation of chromosome 5 represents a recurrent aberration in HCL and that the commonly overrepresented region resides in 5q13-q31. Chromosomal imbalances including deletions of the tumor suppressor gene loci 9p21/P16(INK4A), 13q14/D13S25, and 17p13/P53 rarely occur in HCL in contrast to some other subtypes of B-cell NHL.

The near-haploid lines consisted of 24 and 27 chromosomes, and always retained the second copy of chromosome 21 or its derivative, as detected in one of our patients by SKY.

However, it is not known whether the contents of these pools are regulated during cell proliferation. In the present study we demonstrate that the mass levels of three important constituents of the nuclear PI cycle are regulated during the cell cycle. Radioactive label incorporation into PtdIns(4,5)P(2) was seen to increase dramatically as synchronized cells entered S-phase. This did not coincide with any significant changes in the nuclear mass levels of this lipid, suggesting that the rate of turnover of this molecule was increased. Levels of PtdIns4P, the major substrate for PtdIns(4,5)P(2) production by Type I PtdInsP kinases (PIPkins), were regulated during the cell cycle and indicated a complex relationship between these two lipids. An alternative substrate for PtdIns(4,5)P(2), PtdIns5P, phosphorylated by Type II PIPkins, was present in nuclei at much smaller amounts than the PtdIns4P, and thus is unlikely to contribute significantly to PtdIns(4,5)P(2) turnover. However, a large increase in nuclear PtdIns5P mass was observed when murine erythroleukaemia cells are in G(1), and this could represent a potential pool of nuclear inositol lipid that has a specific signalling role. Analysis of extracted lipid fractions indicated the absence of any PtdIns3P in these nuclei.","['Clarke, J H', 'Letcher, A J', ""D'santos, C S"", 'Halstead, J R', 'Irvine, R F', 'Divecha, N']","['Clarke JH', 'Letcher AJ', ""D'santos CS"", 'Halstead JR', 'Irvine RF', 'Divecha N']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/21 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/21 10:00'],"['2001/07/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0264-6021:3570905 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Aug 1;357(Pt 3):905-10. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3570905.,PMC1222024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of the key substituent was accomplished through directed metalation of the seco-CBI core followed by reaction of the resultant aryllithium with an appropriate electrophile. C3-Bromo and iodo substituents were only effectively installed on the hindered aryllithium intermediate using a novel halogen source, 1-bromo- and 1-iodophenylacetylene, that should prove generally useful beyond the studies we describe. X-ray crystal structures of the series show substantial distortion in the vinylogous amide due to unfavorable steric interactions between the C3-substituent and the N(2)-carbamate. In the halogen series, the N2-C2a bond length and the torsional angle chi(1) smoothly increase with the increasing size of the C3 substituent indicative of decreasing vinylogous amide conjugation through the series (H > F > Cl > Br > I). Unlike N-Boc-CBI, this series of substituted CBI analogues proved remarkably reactive toward solvolysis even at pH 7, where the reaction is uncatalyzed and the reactivity order (I > Br > Cl > F > H) follows a trend consistent with the extent of vinylogous amide conjugation and stabilization. The implications of these observations on the source of catalysis for the DNA alkylation reaction of the natural products are discussed.","['Boger, D L', 'Brunette, S R', 'Garbaccio, R M']","['Boger DL', 'Brunette SR', 'Garbaccio RM']","['Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. boger@scripps.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Org Chem,The Journal of organic chemistry,2985193R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leucomycins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '130288-24-3 (duocarmycin SA)', '69866-21-3 (CC 1065)', 'PJV9990868 (duocarmycin A)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Duocarmycins', 'Humans', '*Indoles', 'Leucomycins/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Pyrroles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",2001/07/21 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/21 10:00'],"['2001/07/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['jo010309g [pii]', '10.1021/jo010309g [doi]']",ppublish,J Org Chem. 2001 Jul 27;66(15):5163-73. doi: 10.1021/jo010309g.,,,,['CA41986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since expression of VCAM-1 alone is not sufficient to render cells susceptible to HTLV-1 fusion, K562 cells appear to express a second molecule critical for HTLV-induced syncytium formation. By immunizing mice with K562 cells, we have isolated four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), K5.M1, K5.M2, K5.M3, and K5.M4, that inhibit HTLV-induced syncytium formation between infected MT2 cells and susceptible K562/VCAM1 cells. These MAbs recognize distinct proteins on the surface of cells as determined by cell phenotyping, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis. Since three of the proteins recognized by the MAbs appear to be GPI linked, we isolated lipid rafts and determined by immunoblot analysis that all four MAbs recognize proteins that sort entirely or in large part to lipid rafts. Dispersion of lipid rafts on the cells by cholesterol depletion with beta-cyclodextrin resulted in inhibition of syncytium formation, and this effect was not seen when the beta-cyclodextrin was preloaded with cholesterol before treating the cells. The results of these studies suggest that lipid rafts may play an important role in HTLV-1 syncytium formation.","['Niyogi, K', 'Hildreth, J E']","['Niyogi K', 'Hildreth JE']","['The Leukocyte Immunochemistry Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 212056, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/drug effects/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Lipids', 'Transfection', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/immunology']",2001/07/20 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/20 10:00'],"['2001/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.16.7351-7361.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Aug;75(16):7351-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.16.7351-7361.2001.,PMC114970,,,"['R01 AI031806/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007445/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2T32-GM07445/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI31806/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we demonstrate that arsenite concentrations above 0.25 microM induce DNA strand breaks in both human leukemia cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Therefore, DNA damage may be involved in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase and proteinase K greatly increased DNA strand breaks in arsenite-treated cells, providing evidence that a large portion of arsenite-induced DNA strand breaks come from excision of oxidative DNA adducts and DNA-protein cross-links. Because DNA strand breaks appear only temporarily during excision repair, the level of detectable DNA strand breaks will be low at any given time point. For this reason many previous studies have only detected low levels of DNA strand breaks. We also show that catalase, and inhibitors of calcium, nitric oxide synthase, superoxide dismutase, and myeloperoxidase, could modulate arsenite-induced DNA damage. We conclude that arsenite induces DNA adducts through calcium-mediated production of peroxynitrite, hypochlorous acid, and hydroxyl radicals.","['Wang, T S', 'Hsu, T Y', 'Chung, C H', 'Wang, A S', 'Bau, D T', 'Jan, K Y']","['Wang TS', 'Hsu TY', 'Chung CH', 'Wang AS', 'Bau DT', 'Jan KY']","['Department of Life Science, Chung Shan Medical and Dental College, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.23 (DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase)', 'EC 3.4.21.64 (Endopeptidase K)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenites/*toxicity', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase', 'Endopeptidase K/metabolism', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Sodium Compounds/*toxicity']",2001/07/20 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/20 10:00'],"['2001/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584901005810 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00581-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2001 Aug 1;31(3):321-30. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00581-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression profiles may offer more information than morphology and provide an alternative to morphology-based tumor classification systems. Gene selection involves a search for gene subsets that are able to discriminate tumor tissue from normal tissue, and may have either clear biological interpretation or some implication in the molecular mechanism of the tumorigenesis. Gene selection is a fundamental issue in gene expression-based tumor classification. In the formation of a discriminant rule, the number of genes is large relative to the number of tissue samples. Too many genes can harm the performance of the tumor classification system and increase the cost as well. In this report, we discuss criteria and illustrate techniques for reducing the number of genes and selecting an optimal (or near optimal) subset of genes from an initial set of genes for tumor classification. The practical advantages of gene selection over other methods of reducing the dimensionality (e.g., principal components), include its simplicity, future cost savings, and higher likelihood of being adopted in a clinical setting. We analyze the expression profiles of 2000 genes in 22 normal and 40 colon tumor tissues, 5776 sequences in 14 human mammary epithelial cells and 13 breast tumors, and 6817 genes in 47 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 25 acute myeloid leukemia samples. Through these three examples, we show that using 2 or 3 genes can achieve more than 90% accuracy of classification. This result implies that after initial investigation of tumor classification using microarrays, a small number of selected genes may be used as biomarkers for tumor classification, or may have some relevance in tumor development and serve as a potential drug target. In this report we also show that stepwise Fisher's linear discriminant function is a practicable method for gene expression-based tumor classification.","['Xiong, M', 'Li, W', 'Zhao, J', 'Jin, L', 'Boerwinkle, E']","['Xiong M', 'Li W', 'Zhao J', 'Jin L', 'Boerwinkle E']","['Human Genetics Center, University of Texas--Houston Health Science Center, Houston, Texas 77225, USA. mxiong@utsph.sph.uth.tmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Genet Metab,Molecular genetics and metabolism,9805456,,IM,"['Humans', '*Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/20 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/20 10:00'],"['2001/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mgme.2001.3193 [doi]', 'S1096-7192(01)93193-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Genet Metab. 2001 Jul;73(3):239-47. doi: 10.1006/mgme.2001.3193.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

This drug not only causes complete remission, but also improves disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) without adding anticoagulants in APL. We have attempted to determine whether ATRA is effective against DIC in rat models induced by tissue factor (TF) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), because the anticoagulant effect of ATRA has been considered to induce thrombomodulin upregulation and TF downregulation on endothelial cells as well as on APL cells. In male Wistar rats, DIC was induced by a 4-h infusion of thromboplastin (3.75 U/kg) or lipopolysaccharide (30 mg/kg). The rats were given ATRA orally each day at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day for 1 week before the injection of TF or LPS in ATRA treatment groups, or given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 10 min before the injection of TF or LPS (200 U/kg, bolus intravenously) in LMWH treatment groups.

In order to systematically evaluate its potential anticancer activity, methyl protogracillin was tested for its cytotoxicity in vitro against 60 human cancer cell lines in the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s anticancer drug screen. As a result, it was found that methyl protogracillin was cytotoxic against all the tested cell lines from leukemia and solid tumors in the NCI's human cancer panel; it showed particular selectivity against one colon cancer line (KM12), one central nervous system (CNS) cancer line (U251), two melanoma lines (MALME-3M and M14), two renal cancer lines (786-0 and UO-31) and one breast cancer line (MDA-MB-231) with GI50< or =2.0 microM. The selectivity between these seven most sensitive lines and the least sensitive line (CCRF-CEM) ranged from 26- to 56-fold. In the same cancer subpanel, selectivity more than 15-fold was observed between MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, NCI-ADR-RES, BT-549 in breast cancer. From a general view of the mean graph, CNS cancer is the most sensitive subpanel, while ovarian cancer and renal cancer are the least sensitive subpanels. Based on an analysis of the COMPARE computer program with methyl protogracillin as a seed compound, no compounds in the NCI's anticancer drug screen database have similar cytotoxicity patterns (mean graph) to that of methyl protogracillin, indicating a potential novel mechanism of the anticancer action involved.","['Hu, K', 'Yao, X']","['Hu K', 'Yao X']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, State University of New York at Buffalo, 539 Hochstetter Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA. kehu@acsu.buffalo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (methyl protogracillin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Databases, Factual', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Saponins/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Steroids/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'United States']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200107000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2001 Jul;12(6):541-7. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200107000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we now show that the expansion of CD4(+) regulatory T cells in response to a chronic viral infection can lead to immunosuppression. Mice persistently infected with Friend retrovirus develop approximately twice the normal percentage of splenic CD4(+) regulatory T cells and lose their ability to reject certain tumor transplants. The role of CD4(+) regulatory T cells was demonstrated by the transmission of immunosuppression to uninfected mice by adoptive transfers of CD4(+) T cells. CD4(+) T cells from chronically infected mice were also immunosuppressive in vitro, inhibiting the generation of cytolytic T lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte cultures. Inhibition occurred at the level of blast-cell formation through a mechanism or mechanisms involving transforming growth factor-beta and the cell surface molecule CTLA-4 (CD152).

The aims of the present study were to examine: (i) the effects of pregnancy and delivery on plasma tryptophan and the amino acids known to compete for the same cerebral uptake mechanism (CAAs), valine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and isoleucine; (ii) the relationships between the availability of plasma tryptophan and postpartum depression or anxiety; and (iii) the relationships between the availability of plasma tryptophan to the brain and inflammatory markers, such as serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 receptor-antagonist (IL-1RA) and the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R). METHODS: The above variables were measured in 13 healthy non-pregnant and in 98 pregnant women 3 to 6 days before delivery and 1 and 3 days after delivery. On each occasion the parturient women completed the state version of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDS). RESULTS: Plasma tryptophan and the tryptophan/CAA ratio were significantly lower at the end of term and after delivery than in the plasma of non-pregnant, healthy women. The tryptophan/CAA ratio was significantly lower in the early puerperium than at the end of term. There were no significant relationships between the availability of plasma tryptophan and either post-partum depression or changes in the STAI or ZDS scores in the early puerperium. The changes in the tryptophan/CAA ratio from the end of term to the early puerperium were significantly and inversely related to serum IL-6, IL-IRA and LIF-R. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the reduction in the availability of plasma tryptophan from the end of term to the early puerperium is related to immune activation; and that the lowered availability of plasma tryptophan is not related either to depressive or anxiety symptoms in the early puerperium or to post-partum depression ensuing some months later.","['Maes, M', 'Ombelet, W', 'Verkerk, R', 'Bosmans, E', 'Scharpe, S']","['Maes M', 'Ombelet W', 'Verkerk R', 'Bosmans E', 'Scharpe S']","['Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, University of Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Psychol Med,Psychological medicine,1254142,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acids/blood', 'Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/*immunology/psychology', 'Brain/immunology', 'Depression, Postpartum/diagnosis/*immunology/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Personality Inventory', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*blood', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Risk Factors', 'Tryptophan/*blood']",2001/07/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1017/s0033291701004007 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychol Med. 2001 Jul;31(5):847-58. doi: 10.1017/s0033291701004007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistant ovarian cancer cells often overexpress bcl-2 or p53 proteins or both. We hypothesized that arsenic compounds, such as As2O3 and As2S3, could also be active against gynecological cancers resistant to conventional chemotherapy. METHODS: We investigated the effects of these two arsenic compounds in vitro on ovarian cancer cell lines sensitive (OVCAR, GG, JAM) and resistant (CI80-13S) to cisplatin (CDDP) and on human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa) in comparison with their effects on human fibroblasts (HF). A fluorometric assay based on measurements of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) in cells was used to determine cell viability. Apoptosis was assessed in terms of cell morphology, by flow cytometry and by a DNA fragmentation assay. RESULTS: Treatment of each cell line with the As2O3 or As2S3 led to a marked dose-dependent decrease in cell growth. The IC50 of the two compounds indicated a significantly greater cytotoxic effect against all the cancer cells tested than against the normal HF. At a clinically achievable concentration (2 microM), As2O3 selectively inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in CI80-13S, OVCAR and HeLa cells but had no significant apoptotic effect on GG or JAM cells or HF. Following treatment with 5 microM As2S3, the CI80-13S, OVCAR and HeLa cells also exhibited growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic compounds (As2O3 and As2S3) can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human ovarian and cervical cancer cells at clinically achievable concentrations, indicating that As2O3 and As2S3 could be effective in the treatment of gynecological cancer.","['Du, Y H', 'Ho, P C']","['Du YH', 'Ho PC']","['Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Sulfides)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100278 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Jun;47(6):481-90. doi: 10.1007/s002800100278.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible alternative is atovaquone, a hydroxynaphthoquinone with anti-Pneumocystis carinii activity. However, it is not known if atovaquone alters the disposition or adverse effects of antileukemic drugs. METHODS: Using a crossover study design, we compared the pharmacokinetics of etoposide and its CYP3A4-formed catechol metabolite when given as a 300 mg/m2 i.v. infusion following daily atovaquone versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in nine patients. RESULTS: The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of etoposide, etoposide catechol and the catechol to etoposide AUC ratio were slightly higher (a median of 8.6%, 28.4%, and 25.9%) following atovaquone as compared to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P=0.055, P= 0.031 and P=0.023), respectively. In vitro analysis in human liver microsomes showed modest inhibition of etoposide catechol formation in the presence of atovaquone. Using uptake of 3H-vinblastine in L-MDR1 cells, atovaquone was shown to inhibit P-glycoprotein with an apparent Ki of 95.6 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Although the effect of atovaquone on etoposide disposition was modest, in light of the fact that the risk of etoposide-related secondary acute myeloid leukemia has been linked to minor changes in schedule and concurrent therapy, we suggest caution with the simultaneous administration of atovaquone and etoposide, particularly if used with other CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein substrates.","['van de Poll, M E', 'Relling, M V', 'Schuetz, E G', 'Harrison, P L', 'Hughes, W', 'Flynn, P M']","['van de Poll ME', 'Relling MV', 'Schuetz EG', 'Harrison PL', 'Hughes W', 'Flynn PM']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'Y883P1Z2LT (Atovaquone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Atovaquone', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Drug Interactions', 'Etoposide/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*pharmacology']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800000250 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Jun;47(6):467-72. doi: 10.1007/s002800000250.,,,,"['21765/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 08658/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Platinum uptake by tumour cells and interaction with DNA was determined at slightly acidic or alkaline pH. To demonstrate low in vivo toxicity the effects of thioplatin on body weight, blood urea nitrogen, white blood cell count and the histopathological appearance of small intestines and kidneys were evaluated at doses that displayed antitumoral effects against human small-cell lung cancer and human colorectal cancer xenotransplants in nude mice. RESULTS: The slightly acidic pH optimum of thioplatin was proven by the altered electrophoretic mobility of plasmid DNA, quantitation of the platinum content in the DNA of tumour cells and cytotoxicity studies. Thioplatin displayed antitumoral activity without severe side effects such as weight loss, renal ischaemia, destruction of villi in the small intestine or leukopenia as observed at comparable doses of cisplatin. Furthermore, probably due to its lipophilic nature, thioplatin was taken up readily even by cisplatin-resistant cells.

The aim of this study was the in vitro modification of AML blasts to an antigen-presenting cell phenotype characterised by upregulated expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 (B7-1). Circulating AML cells were induced to undergo partial differentiation in culture with the cytokines IL-3, IL-6 and GM-CSF; they exhibited variable upregulation of CD80 and continued to express MHC class I and II. These cells remained viable to day 20, in contrast with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), which did not survive under the culture conditions. In contrast to unmanipulated blasts, cultured leukaemic cells expressed B7-1.

There are striking differences in the relevance of receptor mutations in these diseases. CAMT is a rare disease characterized by severe hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia during the first years of life that develops into pancytopenia in later childhood. In patients with CAMT, we found inherited mutations in c-mpl, the gene coding for the thrombopoietin receptor, in 8 out of 8 cases. The type of mutation seems to correlate with the clinical course seen in the patients. Functional studies demonstrated defective thrombopoietin (TPO) reactivity in hematopoietic progenitor cells and platelets in CAMT patients. CN is a group of hematopoietic disorders characterized by profound, absolute neutropenia due to a maturation arrest of myeloid progenitor cells. About 10% of all patients develop secondary MDS/leukemia. The malignant progression is associated with acquired nonsense mutations within the G-CSF receptor gene that lead to the truncation of the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor protein involved in maturation of myeloid progenitor cells. This seems to be one important step in leukemogenesis in CN patients. CAMT is caused by inherited mutations in c-mpl, the gene for the thrombopoietin receptor, which lead to reduced or absent reactivity to TPO. In contrast, mutations in the G-CSF receptor in CN are acquired and are most probably connected with progression of the neutropenia into MDS/leukemia as a result of a loss of differentiation signaling.","['Germeshausen, M', 'Ballmaier, M', 'Welte, K']","['Germeshausen M', 'Ballmaier M', 'Welte K']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*genetics', 'Pancytopenia/etiology/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/deficiency/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Syndrome', 'Thrombocytopenia/congenital/*genetics/pathology', 'Thrombopoietin/physiology']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03599.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2001 Jun;938:305-20; discussion 320-1. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03599.x.,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average length of telomeres in PB leukocytes can be measured using fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry (flow FISH). We previously used flow FISH to characterize the age-related turnover of HSCs in healthy individuals. In this review, we describe results of recent flow FISH studies in patients with selected hematopoietic stem cell-associated disorders: chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and several bone marrow failure syndromes. CML is characterized by a marked expansion of myeloid Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells. Nevertheless, nonmalignant (Ph-) HSCs typically coexist in the bone marrow of CML patients. We analyzed the telomere length in > 150 peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and bone marrow samples of patients with CML as well as samples of Ph- T-lymphocytes. Compared to normal controls, the overall telomere fluorescence in PBLs of patients with CML was significantly reduced. However, no telomere shortening was observed in Ph- T-lymphocytes. Patients in late chronic phase (CP) had significantly shorter telomeres than those assessed earlier in CP. Our data suggest that progressive telomere shortening is correlated with disease progression in CML. Within the group of patients with bone marrow failure syndromes, we only found significantly shortened telomeres (compared to age-adjusted controls) in granulocytes from patients with aplastic anemia (AA). Strikingly, the telomere length in granulocytes from AA patients who had recovered after immunosuppressive therapy (recAA) did not differ significantly from controls, whereas untreated patients and nonresponders with persistent severe pancytopenia (sAANR) showed marked and significant telomere shortening compared to healthy donors and patients with recAA. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between age-adjusted telomere length and peripheral blood counts was found in support of a model in which the degree of cytopenia and the amount of telomere shortening are correlated. These results support the concept of extensive proliferation of HSCs in subgroups of AA patients and suggest a potential use of telomere-length measurements as a prognostic tool in this group of disorders as well.","['Brummendorf, T H', 'Rufer, N', 'Holyoake, T L', 'Maciejewski, J', 'Barnett, M J', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C', 'Young, N', 'Lansdorp, P M']","['Brummendorf TH', 'Rufer N', 'Holyoake TL', 'Maciejewski J', 'Barnett MJ', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC', 'Young N', 'Lansdorp PM']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Otfried Muller Str. 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany. tim.bruemmendorf@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Blood Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Division', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Fanconi Anemia/blood/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/blood/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03598.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2001 Jun;938:293-303; discussion 303-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03598.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological and physical properties.,262-76; discussion 276-7,"Limited functional expression of the viral envelope receptor is a recognized barrier to efficient oncoretroviral mediated gene transfer. To circumvent this barrier we evaluated a number of envelope proteins with respect to gene transfer efficiency into primitive human hematopoietic stem cell populations. We observed that oncoretroviral vectors pseudotyped with the envelope protein of feline endogenous virus (RD114) could efficiently transduce human repopulating cells capable of establishing multilineage hematopoiesis in immunodeficient mice after a single exposure to RD114-pseudotyped vector. Comparable rates of gene transfer with amphotropic and GALV-pseudotyped vectors have been reported, but only after multiple exposures to the viral supernatant. Oncoretroviral vectors pseudotyped with the RD114 or the amphotropic envelopes had similar stability in vitro, indicating that the increased efficiency in gene transfer is at the receptor level likely due to increased receptor expression or an increased receptor affinity for the RD114 envelope. We also found that RD114-pseudotype vectors can be efficiently concentrated, thereby removing any adverse effects of the conditioned media to the long-term repopulating potential of the target human hematopoietic stem cell. These studies demonstrate the potential of RD114-pseudotyped vectors for clinical use.","['Kelly, P F', 'Carrington, J', 'Nathwani, A', 'Vanin, E F']","['Kelly PF', 'Carrington J', 'Nathwani A', 'Vanin EF']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation/virology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Products, env/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Trimetrexate/pharmacology', 'Ultracentrifugation']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2001 Jun;938:262-76; discussion 276-7.,,,,"['P01 HL 53749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-sensitivity detection of these fusion sequences would allow the tracking of clonal contributions of individual, marked hematopoietic progenitor, and stem cells in vivo. Clone detection by Southern blot has helped to analyze models of oligoclonal repopulation but is limited in sensitivity and specificity. Inverse PCR (Nolta et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 2414-2419) can demonstrate the clonal identity by sequencing but does not permit simultaneous detection of multiple clones. In an efficiently transduced rhesus macaque model (Tisdale et al., Blood 92: 2681-2687; Wu et al., Mol. Ther. 1: 285-293) Kim et al. (Blood 96: 1-8) have identified more than 40 insertion sequences from marrow CFU by inverse PCR. However, no previous study has been able to directly analyze the number of clones active in vivo. Here we demonstrate that the application of a recently developed PCR technology allows the simultaneous visualization of multiple integration sites from small clonal contributions to hematopoietic cells. By combining solid-phase primer extension with ligation-mediated PCR, direct genomic sequencing of retroviral integration sites was obtained in murine bone marrow samples. Further development of this technology will allow analysis of the clonal composition of marked hematopoiesis in small and large animals as well as in human gene transfer.","['Schmidt, M', 'Glimm, H', 'Lemke, N', 'Muessig, A', 'Speckmann, C', 'Haas, S', 'Zickler, P', 'Hoffmann, G', 'Von Kalle, C']","['Schmidt M', 'Glimm H', 'Lemke N', 'Muessig A', 'Speckmann C', 'Haas S', 'Zickler P', 'Hoffmann G', 'Von Kalle C']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/cytology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Clone Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03584.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2001 Jun;938:146-55; discussion 155-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03584.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stromal cells are major components of the microenvironment that surrounds hematopoietic cells and are thought to play an important role in hematopoiesis in vivo. Co-culture of HSCs with stromal cells promotes hematopoiesis and self-renewal of HSCs. Definitive hematopoietic cells first appear during mammalian embryonic development in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and it is therefore thought that the microenvironment of this region plays an important role in HSC ontogeny. We have adopted two approaches to studying the contribution of the AGM microenvironment to hematopoiesis. In the first approach, we have developed an in vitro culture system for mouse AGM explants. Hematopoiesis is enhanced in such cultures by the presence of the combination of stem cell factor (SCF), basic fibroblast growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M (SFLO culture). However, transplantation assays revealed that HSCs capable of long-term reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment of irradiated mice (LTR-HSCs) do not expand in AGM-SFLO cultures; rather, these cultures appear to provide a favorable microenvironment for hematogenic angioblasts that are precursors of both endothelial and hematopoietic cells. In our second approach, we have established various stromal cell lines from the mouse AGM region. The AGM-S3 cell line supports human and mouse primitive hematopoietic cells as well as mouse LTR-HSCs. Maintenance of LTR-HSCs is mediated by a mechanism other than SCF signaling through its receptor (c-Kit). These two in vitro approaches should prove useful for further elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie hematopoiesis and HSC self-renewal.","['Nishikawa, M', 'Tahara, T', 'Hinohara, A', 'Miyajima, A', 'Nakahata, T', 'Shimosaka, A']","['Nishikawa M', 'Tahara T', 'Hinohara A', 'Miyajima A', 'Nakahata T', 'Shimosaka A']","['Pharmaceutical Research Laboratory, Pharmaceutical Division, Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd., 3 Miyahara, Takasaki-shi, Gunma 370-1202, Japan. m-nishikawa@kirin.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/*embryology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques/*methods', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Gonads/*embryology', 'Graft Survival', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mesonephros/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",2001/07/19 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/19 10:00'],"['2001/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03579.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2001 Jun;938:109-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03579.x.,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,

All medical and dental charts were reviewed in a retrospective fashion to identify patients who received dental extractions. Preexisting dental disease and intervention (extraction) were evaluated, and parameters such as days of hospitalization and survival rate were compared with those of the remainder population who did not receive dental extractions. RESULTS: Of the 388 patients, 69 underwent dental extractions and 9 had sequelae and complications after the intervention. The resulting complication rate of 13% was reported. Although some patients did experience delay of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant (BMT), or both, no significant difference was found in the number of days in the hospital for BMT and the survival rate for the patients with sequelae and complications (n = 9) and for the remainder population (n = 319) ( >.05).

These findings suggest that retrovirus receptor-bearing glial cells contribute to the neuropathogenesis of MLV, including clone A8, which induces spongiosis in rats only when inoculated into newborns.","['Takase-Yoden, Sayaka', 'Watanabe, Rihito']","['Takase-Yoden S', 'Watanabe R']","['Institute of Life Science, Soka University, Tangi-cho 1-236, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan1.', 'Institute of Life Science, Soka University, Tangi-cho 1-236, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan1.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Brain/blood supply/*virology', 'Endothelium/virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroglia/metabolism', 'Proteins/chemical synthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-82-8-1815 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2001 Aug;82(Pt 8):1815-1820. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-82-8-1815.,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-82-8-1815 [doi],,,,,,

Mitogenic hyperresponsiveness of synovial cells to the LIF/IL-6 family of cyto-kines was caused by sustained gp130-mediated SHP-2/ras/Erk activation due to impaired STAT-mediated induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins which normally limits gp130 signaling.

Here, we focused on the role of the PI3K-regulated serine/threonine kinase Akt-1 in modulating macrophage survival. Akt-1 was constitutively activated in human macrophages and addition of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, suppressed the activation of Akt-1 and induced cell death. Furthermore, suppression of Akt-1 by inhibition of PI3K or a dominant negative (DN) Akt-1 resulted in loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, activation of caspases-9 and -3, and DNA fragmentation. The effects of PI3K inhibition were reversed by the ectopic expression of constitutively activated Akt-1 or Bcl-x(L). Inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1 pathway either by LY294002 or DN Akt-1 had no effect on the constitutive or inducible activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in human macrophages. However, after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway, a marked decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Mcl-1, but not other Bcl-2 family members was observed, and Mcl-1 rescued macrophages from LY294002-induced cell death. Further, inhibition of Mcl-1 by antisense oligonucleotides, also resulted in macrophage apoptosis. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the constitutive activation of Akt-1 regulates macrophage survival through Mcl-1, which is independent of caspases, NF-kappaB, or Bad.","['Liu, H', 'Perlman, H', 'Pagliari, L J', 'Pope, R M']","['Liu H', 'Perlman H', 'Pagliari LJ', 'Pope RM']","['Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, and the VA Chicago Health Care System, Lakeside Division, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.194.2.113 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2001 Jul 16;194(2):113-26. doi: 10.1084/jem.194.2.113.,PMC2193455,,,"['N01-AR62221/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P60-AR30692/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can occur either by apoptosis through active antigen-induced death or cytokine withdrawal. Alternatively, T cell activation can be suppressed by agents that activate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway, such as prostaglandin E2. Stimulation of PKA inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and immune effector functions. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which activation of PKA induces inhibition of proliferation in human leukemic T cell lines. Using a variety of agents that stimulate PKA, we can arrest Jurkat and H9 leukemic T cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, whereas cell viability is hardly affected. This G(1) arrest is associated with an inhibition of cyclin D/Cdk and cyclin E/Cdk kinase activity. Interestingly, expression of cyclin D3 is rapidly reduced by PKA activation, whereas expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27(kip1) is induced. Ectopic expression of cyclin D3 can override the growth suppression induced by PKA activation to some extent, indicating that growth inhibition of leukemic T cells by PKA activation is partially dependent on down-regulation of cyclin D3 expression. Taken together our data suggest that immunosuppression by protein kinase A involves regulation of both cyclin D3 and p27(kip1) expression.","['van Oirschot, B A', 'Stahl, M', 'Lens, S M', 'Medema, R H']","['van Oirschot BA', 'Stahl M', 'Lens SM', 'Medema RH']","['Jordan Laboratory for Hemato-Oncology, G03-647, Utrecht Medical Center, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M104395200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)34787-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Sep 7;276(36):33854-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M104395200.

In the present study, drug sensitive L1210 and multidrug resistant L1210/VCR (characterized by overexpression of P-gp) mouse leukemic cell lines were used as an experimental model. We have found that SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38-MAPK pathway, significantly reduced the degree of the vincristine resistance in L1210/VCR cells. This phenomenon was accompanied by a decrease in the LC(50) value of vincristine from 3.203+/-0.521 to 0.557+/-0.082 microM. The LC(50) value of sensitive cells for vincristine was about 0.011 microM. The effect of SB203580 on L1210/VCR cells was associated with significantly increased intracellular accumulation of [3H]-vincristine in the concentration dependent manner. Prolonged exposure of resistant cells to 30 microM SB203580 did neither significantly influence the gene expression of P-gp, nor change the protein levels of p38-MAPK. Western blot analysis revealed that the MDR phenotype in L1210/VCR cells was associated with increased level and activity of cytosolic p38-MAPK. In resistant cells, the enhanced phosphorylation of both, p38-MAPK and ATF-2 (endogenous substrate for p38-MAPK) was found as well. In conclusion we could remark that SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 kinase pathway, reversed the MDR resistance of L1210/VCR cells. MDR phenotype of these cells is connected with increased levels and activities of p38-MAPK. These findings point to the possible involvement of the p38-MAPK pathway in the modulation of P-gp mediated multidrug resistance in the L1210/VCR mouse leukemic cell line. However, the mechanisms of SB203580 action should be further investigated.","['Barancik, M', 'Bohacova, V', 'Kvackajova, J', 'Hudecova, S', 'Krizanova, O', 'Breier, A']","['Barancik M', 'Bohacova V', 'Kvackajova J', 'Hudecova S', 'Krizanova O', 'Breier A']","['Institute for Heart Research, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 842 33, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0928098701001397 [pii]', '10.1016/s0928-0987(01)00139-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2001 Aug;14(1):29-36. doi: 10.1016/s0928-0987(01)00139-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that salvicine induced DNA strand breaks in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and DNA damage correlated with cell growth inhibition. DNA damage induced by brief exposure to salvicine could be partially reversed, but early DNA breaks triggered the process of apoptosis. Preferential damage in the P2 promoter region of the oncogene c-myc was detected, whereas no obvious DNA damage was found in the 3' region of the same gene. Furthermore, the expression of some protooncogenes such as c-myc, c-fos and c-jun was examined, showing that salvicine produced a reduction in the transcription rate of c-myc in a dose-dependent manner and a marked induction of c-fos and c-jun expression was observed.

In conclusion, children who undergo BMT at younger age have a higher risk of growth failure, and GH deficiency is not a major contributing factor for growth impairment following BMT.","['Shinagawa, T', 'Tomita, Y', 'Ishiguro, H', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Shimizu, T', 'Yasuda, Y', 'Hattori, K', 'Kubota, C', 'Yabe, H', 'Yabe, M', 'Kato, S', 'Shinohara, O']","['Shinagawa T', 'Tomita Y', 'Ishiguro H', 'Matsumoto M', 'Shimizu T', 'Yasuda Y', 'Hattori K', 'Kubota C', 'Yabe H', 'Yabe M', 'Kato S', 'Shinohara O']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Bohseidai, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Endocr J,Endocrine journal,9313485,"['0 (Insulin)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Body Height', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Human Growth Hormone/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Risk Factors']",2001/07/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1507/endocrj.48.133 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr J. 2001 Apr;48(2):133-8. doi: 10.1507/endocrj.48.133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known, however, about the influence of smoking on hematolymphopoietic malignancies. To evaluate this relation, a population-based case-control study was carried out in 12 areas of Italy. METHODS: Detailed interviews on tobacco smoking habits were administered to 1450 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 365 Hodgkin's disease (HD), 270 multiple myeloma (MM), and 649 leukemia (LEU) patients occurring from 1990 to 1993, and 1779 population controls. RESULTS: We found a slightly increased risk for NHL in smokers (odds ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.4 for ever smokers), but a consistent positive association was shown only for follicular NHL. In this subtype, a significant excess risk was observed for ever versus never smokers, after adjustment for gender, age, geographic residence, education, and respondent (OR = 1.8, 95%, CI 1.3-2.7), with a positive exposure-response gradient for smoking duration (p < 0.01). The risk for follicular NHL was significantly elevated only among women, with ever smokers showing OR = 2.3 (CI 1.4-3.8), while for men we found OR = 1.3 (CI 0.69-2.3). No major differences were shown according to age. Female subjects also showed significant positive exposure-response trends for duration. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking could be a risk factor for follicular NHL among women. For HD, MM, or LEU, no clear association was observed.","['Stagnaro, E', 'Ramazzotti, V', 'Crosignani, P', 'Fontana, A', 'Masala, G', 'Miligi, L', 'Nanni, O', 'Neri, M', 'Rodella, S', 'Costantini, A S', 'Tumino, R', 'Vigano, C', 'Vindigni, C', 'Vineis, P']","['Stagnaro E', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Crosignani P', 'Fontana A', 'Masala G', 'Miligi L', 'Nanni O', 'Neri M', 'Rodella S', 'Costantini AS', 'Tumino R', 'Vigano C', 'Vindigni C', 'Vineis P']","['Epidemiology Unit of National Cancer Research Institute, Genoa, Italy. stagnaro@hp380.ist.unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2001/07/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011216102871 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 May;12(4):325-34. doi: 10.1023/a:1011216102871.,,,,['CA51086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the potential relationship between exposure to pets and the development of childhood leukemia. METHODS: Data from 2359 cases of acute leukemia from two large case-control studies were analyzed. Cases were individually matched to population controls on telephone exchange, age, and race. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) associated with pet ownership. RESULTS: Overall, there was no association between pet ownership (either ""any pet"", dog, or cat) and childhood acute leukemia (OR(any pet:) = 1.01, 95% CI 0.89-1.2). Additionally, no relationship was found between exposure to an ill pet and childhood leukemia. CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis suggest that pet ownership (healthy or sick) is unrelated to an increased risk of childhood leukemia.","['Swensen, A R', 'Ross, J A', 'Shu, X O', 'Reaman, G H', 'Steinbuch, M', 'Robison, L L']","['Swensen AR', 'Ross JA', 'Shu XO', 'Reaman GH', 'Steinbuch M', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', '*Animals, Domestic', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cats', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Feline', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/07/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011276417369 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 May;12(4):301-3. doi: 10.1023/a:1011276417369.,,,,"['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 090607/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanism by which these gallic acid derivatives (GDs) induce apoptosis, we studied whether GD-1 and GD-3 can activate caspases. When promyelocytic leukemia HL-60RG cells were treated with GD-1 and GD-3, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), a substrate of caspase-3, was cleaved into 85 kDa of degradative product with increasing incubation time. GA also activated PARP cleavage, which was inhibited by catalase, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyethane)-N,N,N,N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), in addition to a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. Its inhibitory pattern was identical with that of hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase. On the other hand, GD-1- and GD3-induced PARP cleavage was not suppressed by catalase or NAC, but by BAPTA-AM. This suggested that the GD-elicited signaling pathway is different from GA's. Taken together, GDs activated caspase-3 following intracellular Ca2+ elevation independent of reactive oxygen species. Thus, it became evident that the signaling pathway leading to apoptosis was regulated by GDs in a different manner from GA.","['Isuzugawa, K', 'Inoue, M', 'Ogihara, Y']","['Isuzugawa K', 'Inoue M', 'Ogihara Y']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl 3,4,5--trihydroxythiobenzoate)', '0 (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalase/chemistry', 'Dioxoles/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activators/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gallic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism']",2001/07/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.24.844 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2001 Jul;24(7):844-7. doi: 10.1248/bpb.24.844.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological significance of these isotype-switch variants remains obscure. Therefore, we studied the appearance of these isotype-switch variants in two murine MM models, 5T2MM and 5T33MM, both of IgG isotype. With a MM-specific PCR assay we could detect isotype-switch variants in the bone marrow of both the 5T2MM and the 5T33MM bearing mice, reflecting again the close resemblance of this mouse model to the human MM. These isotype-switch variants were not found in an in vitro stroma-independent variant of the 5T33MM line. However, when this 5T33MMvitro line was injected into young syngeneic mice, isotype-switch variants appeared thereafter in the isolated tumour cells. These isotype-switch variants could only originate from the MM-IgG expressing cell since IgG subclones from the 5T33MMvitro line again gave rise to isotype-switch variants. The appearance of IgA cells can be explained by down-stream switching of IgG to IgA, while the emergence of IgM cells have to occur via trans-switching to the sister chromatid as the Cmu region is deleted from the CIS-chromosome. This study demonstrates that isotype-switch variants originate from the major tumour clone suggesting no role for the MM-IgM expressing cell as a pre-switch precursor MM cell.

We reviewed 20 consecutive localized stage I/II nasal NK/T cell lymphomas treated at our institution over a 29 year period. Median age was 44 (range 23-71). Front-line therapy was generally radiotherapy alone (35-70 Gy) before 1980 and combination chemotherapy after 1980. Six patients were treated with first-line radiotherapy and they achieved complete remission (CR). Two subsequently received combination chemotherapy. Five of those patients remained in complete remission, after 97+ to 277+ months. Twelve patients were treated with first-line chemotherapy including CHOP or CHOP-like regimen in seven cases, and COP in five cases. Only three of them achieved CR, five had partial response and four had progressive disease. Five of the seven patients treated with CHOP did not achieve complete remission. The nine patients who failed to achieve CR with chemotherapy subsequently received salvage radiotherapy but only two of them obtained CR. Finally, two patients were treated with alternated chemotherapy and radiotherapy and achieved CR, which persisted after 14+ and 26+ months. Median survival was not reached in patients who received front-line radiotherapy, and was 35 months in patients who received front-line chemotherapy. These findings confirm that chemotherapy gives a low complete remission rate in localized nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. By contrast, first-line radiotherapy seems to give favorable results, whereas its results are poorer when administered after resistance to chemotherapy. Whether the use of chemotherapy after radiotherapy, or alternated chemotherapy-radiotherapy regimens give better clinical results than radiotherapy alone will have to be evaluated prospectively in this type of NHL.","['Ribrag, V', 'Ell Hajj, M', 'Janot, F', 'Girinsky, T', 'Domenge, C', 'Schwaab, G', 'Fenaux, P', 'Bosq, J']","['Ribrag V', 'Ell Hajj M', 'Janot F', 'Girinsky T', 'Domenge C', 'Schwaab G', 'Fenaux P', 'Bosq J']","['Departement de Medecine, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Nose Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402148 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jul;15(7):1123-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402148.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has also been reported by others that VK2 showed the differentiation-inducing activity in leukemia cell lines. To investigate the discrepancy between apoptosis- and differentiation-inductions of leukemia cells by VK2 treatment, we used bcl-2 gene transfected HL-60 cells (HL-60-bcl-2) which resulted in five-fold over-expression of BCL-2 protein, and then compared the effects of MK4 to the control HL-60-neo cells. Seventy-two hours of exposure to various concentrations of MK4 resulted in growth inhibition of these cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.1-50 microM), however, HL-60-bcl-2 was less sensitive against MK4. MK4 potently induced apoptosis of HL-60-neo cells along with the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activation. Notably, HL-60-bcl-2 was almost completely resistant to apoptosis induction in response to MK4, although cell growth inhibition was still observed. In spite of the abrogation of apoptosis induction, about 90% of HL-60-bcl-2 cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase within 48 h of exposure to 10 microM of MK4 accompanied by up-modulation of p27KIP1 expression. Concomitantly, HL-60-bcl-2 cells underwent monocytic differentiation. These data suggest that VK2 also shows the differentiation inducing effects on leukemia cells which are resistant against VK2-inducing apoptosis. The dichotomous nature of VK2 against leukemia cells appears to have clinical benefits for the treatment of patients with leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Miyazawa, K', 'Yaguchi, M', 'Funato, K', 'Gotoh, A', 'Kawanishi, Y', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Yuo, A', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Miyazawa K', 'Yaguchi M', 'Funato K', 'Gotoh A', 'Kawanishi Y', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Yuo A', 'Ohyashiki K']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Tokyo Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Vitamin K/*pharmacology']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402155 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jul;15(7):1111-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402155.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still unclear which other stromal molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. We chose, as a model system, a mouse plasmacytoma cell line, which does not respond to IL-6. We found that the formation of mouse plasmacytoma tumors, in an in vivo skin transplantation model, is facilitated by co-injection of these tumor cells along with a mesenchymal stromal cell. The tumor promoting effect of the stroma was reproduced in an in vitro model; stromal cells induced the proliferation of plasmacytoma cells under serum-free conditions. This growth promotion could not be mimicked by a series of cytokines including IL-6 and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I implying a role for yet unidentified stromal factors. The in vivo formation of plasmacytoma tumors was reduced following administration of activin A, a cytokine member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)beta superfamily. Furthermore, the in vitro growth promoting effect of the stroma was abrogated by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) which induced a higher stromal expression of activin A. Our results thus show that mesenchymal stroma expresses plasmacytoma growth stimulating activities that overcome the low constitutive level of the plasmacytoma inhibitor, activin A. The expression of activin A is upregulated by bFGF rendering the stroma suppressive for plasmacytoma growth. The balance between the expression of these regulators may contribute to mesenchymal stroma activity and influence the progression of multiple myeloma.","['Shoham, T', 'Sternberg, D', 'Brosh, N', 'Krupsky, M', 'Barda-Saad, M', 'Zipori, D']","['Shoham T', 'Sternberg D', 'Brosh N', 'Krupsky M', 'Barda-Saad M', 'Zipori D']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Animals', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*pharmacology', 'Inhibins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402145 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jul;15(7):1102-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402145.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is still not clear to what extent, if any, these cell populations overlap. The chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) prolongs survival of LTC-IC in suspension cultures and we now show that in longterm bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) maintenance of haemopoiesis was significantly better from the CD34+ cells which possess MIP-1alpha receptors (P < 0.006). We examined one MIP-1alpha receptor, CCR1, which is present on CD34+ cells from haemopoietic tissues. In LTBMC the production of GM-CFC from CD34+CCR1- cells was significantly higher (P < 0.02) than that from CD34+CCR1+ cultures and the incidence of LTC-IC was 3- to 6-fold higher in the CD34+CCR1- cell fraction. In contrast, the cells responsible for high levels of engraftment in NOD/SCID mice were contained in the CD34+CCR1+ cell fraction. The CD34+CCR1+ cells engrafted to high levels in NOD/SCID and generated large numbers of progenitor cells.

This strategy has, however, produced conflicting results and because of an uncertain predictive value, its use in the clinical setting cannot be recommended. The objective of the current study was to evaluate if quantification by Real Time RT-PCR could be useful to determine levels of CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts predictive of clinical outcome in inv(16)(p13q22) AML at diagnosis or during remission. Bone marrow (BM) samples from 16 patients with inv(16) AML enrolled on a German multicenter trial (AML HD93) were analyzed for levels of CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts by Real Time RT-PCR at diagnosis (n= 14), during remission (n= 10) and at relapse (n=6). The CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript copy number in each sample was normalized to copies of an internal control housekeeping transcript (ie 18S). The copy number measured at diagnosis or relapse were 3 to 4 log higher that those measured during remission, following completion of induction treatment. A high CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript copy number at diagnosis had a significant correlation with a high percentage of BM blasts (Spearman's coefficient = -0.66; P= 0.03), and a borderline correlation with a short complete remission (CR) duration (Spearman's coefficient = -0.51; P= 0.07). No difference in levels of CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts measured during intensification therapy was found between patients destined to relapse and those who continued in CCR (P= 0.75).

The results of the current study, therefore, suggest that it is possible to determine in remission samples a threshold of CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript copy number above which relapse occurs and below which continuous CR is likely.","['Marcucci, G', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Dohner, H', 'Archer, K J', 'Schlenk, R F', 'Dohner, K', 'Maghraby, E A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Marcucci G', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Dohner H', 'Archer KJ', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner K', 'Maghraby EA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (mutY adenine glycosylase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*DNA Glycosylases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402159 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jul;15(7):1072-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402159.,,,,['P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML-RARalpha transcript's levels were normalised to 10(5) copies of ABL transcript. Serial BM and PB samples from 16 patients with APL and t(15;17) were examined.

Serial quantitation of MRD in both BM and PB samples showed significantly lower levels of PML-RARalpha transcripts in remission, although the majority of samples remain positive for the PML-RARalpha transcripts even those in long-term remission (up to 94 months). Levels of PML-RARalpha in remission samples were up to 2 x 10(2) and up to 5.2 x 10(1) molecules in BM and PB respectively.

The same samples, when tested with a standard qualitative RT-PCR for the amplification of PML-RARalpha (with a sensitivity of 10(-4)) produced negative results.

On the basis of chromosome aberrations patients can be stratified in groups reflecting either good or poor prognosis. However, the majority of patients fall in an 'intermediate risk' group. Internal tandem duplications in the hematopoietic growth factor receptor Flt3 have been shown to separate a subset of high risk patients from intermediate or low risk cases. In an attempt to further characterize the heterogeneity of prognosis among the cytogenetic intermediate risk group of AML, we investigated the overall survival, failure-free survival, initial therapy response and relapse rates of 103 patients with de novo AML in relation to autonomous proliferation and the proliferative response to a panel of 10 cytokines in a short-term thymidine incorporation assay. To exclude perturbation of the responses by other (known) risk factors our final intermediate risk population was comprised of patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics, having an age of 60 years of younger and not showing tandem duplications in the Flt3 gene. Among this intermediate risk group, only the responses to M-CSF and IL-1alpha were found to be predictive for therapy outcome. Results obtained by a 7-day culture with these cytokines revealed two subpopulations characterized by a good and a poor prognosis, respectively. The complete remission rates in these subpopulations were similar, but the relapse rates, failure-free survival and overall survival differed.

Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis was age-adjusted triple intrathecal chemotherapy. Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis were treated with craniospinal irradiation after the intensive phase. Continuation was standard doses of MTX and MP for 2 years. This trial was closed early because of an apparent early difference favoring regimen B. Results show that 470 patients achieved remission (97%). Two hundred and thirty two were randomized to regimen A and 238 to regimen B.

The signaling pathways by which these receptors induce apoptosis are similar and rely on oligomerization of the receptor by death ligand binding, recruitment of an adapter protein through homophilic interaction of cytoplasmic domains, and subsequent activation of an inducer caspase which initiates execution of the cell death programme. The ability of these receptors and their ligands to kill malignant cells was discovered early and helped to coin the term 'tumor necrosis factor' for the first identified death ligand.

In unicellular organisms, cells divide and multiply in a manner that is chiefly determined by the availability of nutritional substrates. In a multicellular organism, each cell has a distinct growth potential that is designed to subsume a role in the function of the whole body. Departure from this path to one of uncontrolled cellular proliferation leads to cancer. For this reason, evolution has endowed cells with an elaborate set of systems that cause errant cells to self-destruct. This process of cell suicide is known as apoptosis or programmed cell death and it plays a crucial role in the growth of both normal and malignant cells. In this review, we describe the mechanisms whereby programmed cell death is induced and executed. In particular, we concentrate on how anti-apoptotic signals generated by cytokines promote cell survival and how these signal transduction pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of neoplasia. Understanding how these processes contribute to tumorigenesis may suggest new therapeutic options.","['White, M K', 'McCubrey, J A']","['White MK', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, The Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402143 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jul;15(7):1011-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402143.,,,,"['CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK45718/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",190,,,,,,,,,,,,

These receptors all contain an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain that is critical to signaling. Aberrant expression of the FLT3 gene has been documented in both adult and childhood leukemias including AML, ALL and CML. In addition, 17-27% of pediatric and adult patients with AML have small internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3. Patients expressing the mutant form of the receptor have been shown to have a decreased chance for cure. Our previous study, using a constitutively activated FLT3, demonstrated transformation of Ba/F3 cells and leukemic development in an animal model. Thus, there is accumulating evidence for a role for FLT3 in human leukemias. This has prompted us to search for inhibitors of FLT3 as a possible therapeutic approach in these patients. AG1296 is a compound of the tyrphostin class that is known to selectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF and KIT receptors. Since FLT3 is a close relative of KIT, we wanted to test the possible inhibitory activity of AG1296 on FLT3. In transfected Ba/F3 cells, AG1296 selectively and potently inhibited autophosphorylation of FL-stimulated wild-type and constitutively activated FLT3. Treatment by AG1296 abolished IL-3-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing the constitutively activated FLT3 and thus, reversed the transformation mediated by activated FLT3. Inhibition of FLT3 activity by AG1296 in cells transformed by activated FLT3 resulted in apoptotic cell death, with no deleterious effect on their parental counterparts. Addition of IL-3 rescued the growth of cells expressing activated FLT3 in the presence of AG1296. This demonstrates that the inhibition is specific to the FLT3 pathway in that it leaves the kinases of the IL-3 pathway and other kinases further downstream involved in proliferation intact. Several proteins phosphorylated by the activated FLT3 signaling pathway, including STAT 5A, STAT 5B and CBL, were no longer phosphorylated when these cells were treated with AG1296. The activity against FLT3 suggests a potential therapeutic application for AG1296 or similar drugs in the treatment of leukemias involving deregulated FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity and as a tool for studying the biology of FLT3.","['Tse, K F', 'Novelli, E', 'Civin, C I', 'Bohmer, F D', 'Small, D']","['Tse KF', 'Novelli E', 'Civin CI', 'Bohmer FD', 'Small D']","['Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Department of Oncology, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '146535-11-7 (6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/07/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402199 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jul;15(7):1001-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402199.,,,,['CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that in a bone nodule forming in vitro model of osteogenesis, the fetal rat calvaria (RC) cell model, LIF inhibits osteoblast differentiation, acting on late osteoprogenitors and/or early osteoblasts. These results are in contrast to in vivo experiments, in which LIF has been found to increase bone formation. To resolve this discrepancy, we have tested the effect of LIF on rat bone marrow (RBM) stromal cell cultures, an in vitro model encompassing earlier osteoprogenitor stages. LIF inhibited cell growth in early, proliferating RBM cultures, but increased the culture saturation density. The effect of LIF on bone nodule formation in this model was cell density dependent and biphasic. Continuous treatment with LIF reduced the number of bone nodules present in confluent, more mature cultures, and the inhibitory effect was strongest when cells were plated at higher cell density than lower. In contrast, during the early stages of RBM culture, nodule numbers were higher in LIF-treated dishes than in controls, and this effect was greater in lower density cultures. Acute LIF treatment restricted to early time points increased the final number of bone nodules formed in mature RBM cell cultures, but not in RC cell cultures. Our results indicate that LIF exerts complex, stage-specific effects on osteoprogenitor recruitment, differentiation, and bone formation, and that the effects are cell nonautonomous, in the rat bone marrow stromal cell model.

However, we failed to find a clear picture for growth factors implicated in early T-cell activation (interferon-gamma, interleukin [IL]-4, IL-12), although we observed that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) was associated with absence of acute rejection. We have now studied tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and its two soluble receptors, sTNFRI and sTNFRII, IL-1beta and soluble IL-1 receptor II (sIL-1RII), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), all potential modulators of T-cell activation. METHODS: Sixty-six cadaver kidney transplants (KTX) were divided into four groups: group 1, day 7 after KTX, stable (n=30); group 2, day 7 after KTX, 8+/-4.5 days before acute rejection (n=12); group 3, first day of acute rejection (n=17); and group 4, day 14 after KTX, stable (n=32). Patients from groups 1 and 4 remained rejection-free for the first 6 months. All rejection episodes were confirmed by core renal biopsy. FNAB samples were cultured according to our published methodology, and culture supernatants were collected at 48 hr and analyzed by ELISA for IL-1beta, sIL-1RII, TNF-alpha, sTNFRI, sTNFRII, and LIF. Serum levels for sIL-1RII, sTNFRI, and sTNFRII were also measured. RESULTS: FNAB cultures from groups 1 and 4 synthesized significantly lower amounts of sTNFRI and sTNFRII than those from either groups 2 or 3. Both sTNFRI and sTNFRII reached high positive and negative predictive values for acute rejection. IL-1beta and sIL-1RII were synthesized by all groups but without differences. No trace of LIF and TNF-alpha was found. sTNFRII was significantly higher in serum from group 3. CONCLUSIONS: Both TNF receptors were positively associated with acute rejection and were good predictors of impending acute rejection. The ratio of sIL-1RII over IL-1 (together with IL-1ra that we previously measured in FNAB cultures) suggests that IL-1 actions may be inhibited with current immunosuppression early after transplantation.","['Oliveira, J G', 'Xavier, P', 'Sampaio, S M', 'Mendes, A A', 'Pestana, M']","['Oliveira JG', 'Xavier P', 'Sampaio SM', 'Mendes AA', 'Pestana M']","['Renal Department, Hospital S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: For 100 patients recruited within the framework of the ""Kooperative AML-Studie 96"" of the Suddeutsche Hamoblastosegruppe a process cost analysis was made between 1996 and 1999. All manpower and material costs incurred in the department itself and in the secondary services departments as well as the basic cost shares were recorded taking into due account the length of stay. The cost breakdown was effected based on a double induction therapy and one early consolidation treatment. RESULTS: It turns out that substantial differences exist between lower und upper limits of the length of stay and costs. For all three therapy blocks for patients up to 60 years the cost spread varies between 63 and 204 kDM with a median of 105 kDM, and for older patients between 55.6 and 146.6 kDM with a median of 87.6 kDM. On average, the costs subject to length of stay were roughly 70%. CONCLUSIONS: As the costs per case are subject to a spread and, for this relatively small group of patients, are extremely high, the fixing of a case-related lump sum is problematic, the more so as age of patient, comorbidity, type of therapy, ist outcome, and therapy-induced complications represent decisive influencing factors.","['Kuse, R', 'Colberg, H', 'Marbe, W', 'Kodalle, O', 'Kalmar, P', 'Lohfert, C']","['Kuse R', 'Colberg H', 'Marbe W', 'Kodalle O', 'Kalmar P', 'Lohfert C']","['Hamatologische Abteilung, Allgemeinen Krankenhauses St. Georg, Lohmuhlenstrasse 5, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany.']","['eng', 'ger']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups/*economics', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Hospital Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/economics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Health Programs/*economics']",2001/07/17 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['55095 [pii]', '10.1159/000055095 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2001 Jun;24(3):292-4. doi: 10.1159/000055095.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

New derivatives of the 1,5-diazabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-diones were synthesized and examined for antiproliferative effects and selective inhibition of human IMPDH type II activity. The 3,3-disubstituted-6,6-pentamethylene-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-diones proved to be effective antiproliferative agents in tumor cell lines derived from murine and human leukemias, lymphomas, uterine carcinoma, glioma, and breast effusion with ED50 values (concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of cell growth) ranging from 3.3 to 16 microM. The agents acted as antimetabolites suppressing de novo purine biosynthesis at the key regulatory enzyme IMPDH, resulting in the specific suppression of dGTP pool levels by 19 to 64% and DNA synthesis by 39 to 68%. The derivatives were specific inhibitors of IMPDH type II activity as opposed to type I, acting in a competitive manner with respect to inosine 5'-monophosphate, K(i) values of 44.2 to 62 microM. In addition, effects of agents on Tmolt4 cell growth and DNA synthesis could be reversed by coincubation with guanosine. Unlike mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin, the 6,6-pentamethylene-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-diones specifically targeted type II IMPDH, where activity is increased in replicating or neoplastic cells, and did not suppress type I activity, where expression is relatively unaffected by cell proliferation or transformation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 65 patients, aged 2 months to 20 years at BMT, with ALL in 2CR underwent allogeneic BMT at seven Nordic centers during 1990 to 1997. Of the first relapses, 85% were in bone marrow; 46% occurred on therapy, and 54%, off therapy. The preparative regimens were cyclophosphamide plus total-body irradiation +/- antithymocyte/antilymphocyte globulin, busulfan plus cyclophosphamide +/- antithymocyte/antilymphocyte globulin, or cytarabine plus total-body irradiation. Of the allografts, 37 were from HLA-matched siblings and 28 were from URDs. RESULTS: In the sibling versus URD graft recipient groups, the posttransplantation 5-year event-free survival was 39% versus 54% (P =.4), the estimated posttransplantation relapse rate was 76% versus 40% (P = not significant [NS]), and the toxic death rate was 19% versus 11% (P = NS). The incidence of significant (grade 2 to 4) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 38% versus 64% (P <.05) and was 14% versus 32% (P <.10) for severe (grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD; the incidence of chronic GVHD was 26% versus 57% (P <.05) and was 13% versus 22% (P = NS) for extensive chronic GVHD in the sibling and URD groups. CONCLUSION: BMT with matched URD allografts offers at least equal survival for children with ALL in 2CR, as compared with allografts from matched sibling donors. URD allografts were not associated with a higher toxic mortality rate, although both acute and chronic GVHD were more frequent with URD. Indications for using matched URD allografts in ALL 2CR can be considered the same as for using matched sibling donors.","['Saarinen-Pihkala, U M', 'Gustafsson, G', 'Ringden, O', 'Heilmann, C', 'Glomstein, A', 'Lonnerholm, G', 'Abrahamsson, J', 'Bekassy, A N', 'Schroeder, H', 'Mellander, L']","['Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Gustafsson G', 'Ringden O', 'Heilmann C', 'Glomstein A', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Bekassy AN', 'Schroeder H', 'Mellander L']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. ulla.pihkala@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA Antigens', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Nuclear Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/07/17 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.14.3406 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jul 15;19(14):3406-14. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.14.3406.,,,['Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two allogeneic transplantations after nonmyeloablative preparative regimens were reported to the Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle Registry registry. Initial diagnoses were lymphoid diseases (n = 22), myeloma (n = 14), acute leukemia and myelodysplasia (n = 41), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 12), and solid tumors (n = 3). Forty-six patients had previously received a transplant, and 49 had progressive disease before transplantation. Three types of conditioning regimens were used with fludarabine or antithymocyte globulins. Eighty-nine patients underwent transplantation, 60 from peripheral-blood progenitor cells. Eighty-six patients received graft-versus-host disease (GHVD) prophylaxis for a median duration of 53 days. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients engrafted, with 40 complete and 21 mixed chimerisms. The acute GHVD rate at 3 months was 50% +/- 11%. Fifty-two patients achieved complete remission and 12, partial remission. At 18 months after transplantation, the overall survival (OS) and the transplant-related mortality (TRM) were 32% +/- 12% and 38% +/- 14%, respectively. Initial diagnosis and disease status before transplantation significantly influenced survival. Age and GHVD prophylaxis type significantly influenced TRM. We also showed an impact of GHVD prophylaxis duration on OS and TRM. In multivariate analysis, three factors remained of prognostic value on OS: initial diagnosis, disease status at transplantation, and GHVD prophylaxis duration. CONCLUSION: This series shows encouraging results from nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens before allotransplantation and demonstrates the impact of some pre- and posttransplantation factors on outcome after transplantation.","['Michallet, M', 'Bilger, K', 'Garban, F', 'Attal, M', 'Huyn, A', 'Blaise, D', 'Milpied, N', 'Moreau, P', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Kuentz, M', 'Sadoun, A', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Socie, G', 'Thomas, X', 'Arnaud, P', 'Raus, N', 'Lheritier, V', 'Pigneux, A', 'Boiron, J M']","['Michallet M', 'Bilger K', 'Garban F', 'Attal M', 'Huyn A', 'Blaise D', 'Milpied N', 'Moreau P', 'Bordigoni P', 'Kuentz M', 'Sadoun A', 'Cahn JY', 'Socie G', 'Thomas X', 'Arnaud P', 'Raus N', 'Lheritier V', 'Pigneux A', 'Boiron JM']","['Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle Registry, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/07/17 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.14.3340 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jul 15;19(14):3340-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.14.3340.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F035 and the avicins markedly inhibited the growth of several tumor cell lines with minimum growth inhibition in human foreskin fibroblasts, mouse fibroblasts, and immortalized breast epithelial cells at similar concentrations. F035 and the avicins induced cell cycle (G1) arrest of the human MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell line and apoptosis of the Jurkat (T-cell leukemia) and the MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line. The triterpenoid saponins also partially inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in Jurkat T cells in a time-dependent manner and phosphorylation in the downstream protein Akt, whereas no affect was seen on the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. These observations as well as other work from our laboratory demonstrating mitochondrial perturbation, chemoprevention, and inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB suggest that triterpenoid saponins from A. victoriae have potential as novel anticancer agents.

Although degradation of 8-Cl-cAMP to 8-Cl-Ado in culture medium or plasma has been shown, cellular pharmacology data are missing. The purpose of the present study was to identify the cellular metabolism of these drugs and their actions in a human multiple myeloma cell line. The cells were incubated with either 8-Cl-Ado or 8-Cl-cAMP to follow the cellular metabolism of these agents. Both 8-Cl-cAMP and 8-Cl-Ado incubation resulted in the accumulation of 8-Cl-Ado mono-, di-, and tri-phosphate (8-Cl-ATP), however, the triphosphate was the major cytotoxic metabolite. Accumulation of 8-Cl-ATP was dependent on both the exogenous concentration of 8-Cl-Ado and incubation time. At the 10 microM level of 8-Cl-Ado, >400 microM 8-Cl-ATP accumulated in multiple myeloma cells after continuous incubation for 12 h. Similar incubation with 8-Cl-cAMP also resulted in accumulation of 8-Cl-ATP in the cells, albeit at a lower level. The formation of 8-Cl-ATP from 8-Cl-cAMP was inhibited by >80% in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in the medium, suggesting extracellular conversion of 8-Cl-cAMP to 8-Cl-Ado. Cells lacking Ado kinase did not accumulate 8-Cl-ATP, either from 8-Cl-Ado or 8-Cl-cAMP, and were resistant to these agents. There was also a decline in the endogenous level of the cellular ATP pool parallel to the accumulation of 8-C1-ATP. The elimination of 8-Cl-ATP was biphasic and slow from the cells. The accumulation of 8-Cl-ATP and a decline in the ATP pool inhibited RNA synthesis but did not affect DNA synthesis for up to 12 h of incubation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the cytotoxic metabolite of 8-Cl-Ado and 8-Cl-cAMP is 8-Cl-ATP. Hence, 8-Cl-cAMP serves as a prodrug and is converted to 8-Cl-Ado in medium with subsequent phosphorylation to accumulate as 8-Cl-ATP in cells. At the cellular level, 8-Cl-ATP is associated with a decrease in the endogenous ATP pool; at the nuclear level, it inhibits RNA synthesis.","['Gandhi, V', 'Ayres, M', 'Halgren, R G', 'Krett, N L', 'Newman, R A', 'Rosen, S T']","['Gandhi V', 'Ayres M', 'Halgren RG', 'Krett NL', 'Newman RA', 'Rosen ST']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics and Leukemia, the University of Texas M.

In this study, three anti-PML adamantyl-conjugated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers previously described as in vitro inhibitors of PML/RARalpha translation were combined and used to block PML/RARalpha synthesis in NB4 cells. Cationic liposomes were used to achieve sufficient delivery of PNAs into the cells. Upon treatment of cells with the liposome/PNA mixture, enhanced cellular uptake of PNA (approximately 5-fold compared with control) was obtained. Concomitantly, a substantial reduction (>90%) of the expression of PML/RARalpha was observed when all of the three PNAs were used together. This resulted in a dramatic effect on the number and viability of NB4 cells in culture after 48 h of treatment. This phenomenon was preceded by induction of apoptosis that could be observed 24 h after treatment. No sign of granulocytic differentiation was observed after treatment. These effects were also noted on other leukemic cell lines that express PML but not the fusion transcript. These results show that it is possible to deliver PNA into hematopoietic cells and obtain specific gene inhibition, and they suggest that a growth inhibitory effect on acute promyelocytic leukemia cells can be obtained through the block of PML/RARalpha and PML expression.","['Mologni, L', 'Marchesi, E', 'Nielsen, P E', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C']","['Mologni L', 'Marchesi E', 'Nielsen PE', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, 20133 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/genetics/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/07/17 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jul 15;61(14):5468-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a highly vascular neoplasm, is an excellent model for studying tumor angiogenesis and antiangiogenic agent efficacy. We investigated the effects of angiostatin gene transfer in in vitro and in vivo models of KS-induced neovascularization and tumor growth. A eukaryotic expression plasmid and a Moloney leukemia virus-based retroviral vector for expression of murine angiostatin were generated harboring the angiostatin cDNA with cleavable leader signals under the control of either the strong cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer or the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat. Angiostatin secretion was confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Supernatants of angiostatin-transfected cells inhibited endothelial cell migration in vitro. Stable gene transfer of the angiostatin cDNA by retroviral vectors in KS-IMM cells resulted in sustained angiostatin expression and delayed tumor growth in nude mice, which was associated with reduced vascularization. These findings suggest that gene therapy with angiostatin might be useful for treatment of KS and possibly other highly angiogenic tumors.","['Indraccolo, S', 'Morini, M', 'Gola, E', 'Carrozzino, F', 'Habeler, W', 'Minghelli, S', 'Santi, L', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Cao, Y', 'Albini, A', 'Noonan, D M']","['Indraccolo S', 'Morini M', 'Gola E', 'Carrozzino F', 'Habeler W', 'Minghelli S', 'Santi L', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Cao Y', 'Albini A', 'Noonan DM']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Biotechnology Section-Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '86090-08-6 (Angiostatins)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)']",IM,"['Angiostatins', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/*physiology', 'Plasminogen/genetics/*physiology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/genetics/*pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/17 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jul 15;61(14):5441-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a novel anticancer agent for treatment of solid cancers, As2O3 is promising, but no in vivo experimental investigations of its efficacy on solid cancers have been done at clinically obtained concentrations. In addition, the cell death mechanism of As2O3 has yet to be clarified, especially in solid cancers. In this study, human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, DU-145, and TSU-PR1 were examined as cellular models for As2O3 treatment, and As2O3-induced cell death and inhibition of cell growth and colony formation were evaluated. The involvement of p38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), caspase-3, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were investigated in As2O3-induced cell death. Finally, As2O3 was administered to severe combined immunodeficient mice inoculated orthotopically with PC-3 cells to estimate in vivo efficacy. In all three of the cell lines, at high concentrations, As2O3 induced apoptosis and, at low concentrations, growth inhibition. As2O3 activated p38, JNK, and caspase-3 dose dependently. Treatment with the p38 inhibitor and over-expression of dominant-negative JNK did not guard against As2O3-induced cell death. In contrast with partial protection by the caspase-3 inhibitor, the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine gave marked protection from As2O3-induced apoptosis and eliminated the activation of p38, JNK, and caspase-3, and the generation of ROS. The orthotopic murine metastasis model showed in vivo tumor growth inhibition in orthotopic and metastatic lesions with no signs of toxicity.

Reverse transcription-PCR of two cases with t(7;12), using primers for c7orf3 and ETV6, was negative.

Despite widespread application of standardized protocols, inter-laboratory reproducibility has still not been achieved. The complexity of diagnosis and evaluation of minimal residual disease, in immunophenotyping acute leukemia, demands the use of a test that provides all the necessary information. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: The information given here is derived from the experience of the authors and from literature files. The most relevant studies with adequate conclusions were considered. We report on the current status of multiparametric immunophenotyping using simultaneous three and four-color staining and the applications of this technique. RESULTS: Multiparametric immunophenotyping is a powerful method for achieving a clear discrimination between normal and pathologic cells. The specific identification of leukemic cells by immunologic gating forms the basis for immunophenotypic diagnosis, classification as well as prognostic evaluation of patients with acute leukemias. The performance of the procedure with regards to the panels of reagents and the analytic processes, is necessarily different in lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias, since the diagnostic questions are different. Phenotypic information should be specifically provided for the blast cells and antigen expression should preferably be reported in quantitative units and CV. This would allow a standardized cross evaluation of immunophenotypic results between different investigators and laboratories. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Recent reports indicate that phenotypic aberrations reflect genetic abnormalities of leukemic cells and therefore their definition and identification is of clinical relevance not only for minimal residual disease monitoring but also for subclassifying acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias.","['Basso, G', 'Buldini, B', 'De Zen, L', 'Orfao, A']","['Basso G', 'Buldini B', 'De Zen L', 'Orfao A']","['Laboratorio di Oncoematologia Dipartimento di Pediatria, Universita di Padova, via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy. gbasso@oncopedipd.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/standards', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods/standards', 'Leukemia/classification/*diagnosis/pathology']",2001/07/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jul;86(7):675-92.,,,,,141,,,,['Haematologica. 2001 Jul;86(7):673-4.

Mechanistically, either trisomy 1q or monosomy 18p that results from the translocation may potentially contribute to leukemogenesis.

Forty-one patients were diagnosed during a 12-year period. The age varied between 14 and 82 (mean 37, median 32). Thirty-two patients were cytogenetically investigated and in all cases analysable metaphases were obtained (range 10-29, mean 24, median 25, success rate: 100%). Nine (28%) patients had a T-phenotype and 23 (72%) had a pre-B phenotype. High hyperdiploidy was found in four patients (13%). Hypodiploidy was found in 5 patients (16%), 10 (31%) had a pseudodiploid chromosome mode and four (13%) showed low hyperdiploidy (chromosome mode 47-51). Chromosomes 10 and 18 were most frequently involved in numerical aberrations. Structural aberrations most frequently involved chromosomes 6, 9 and 22. t(9;22) was seen in six cases (19%), del(6q) in five cases (16%) and der(9p) in five cases (16%). High hyperdiploid clones, which are associated with a favorable prognosis, were found with the same frequency as in other studies. The frequency of t(9;22) was 19% in our study, others have found frequencies between 11% and 30%. Compared to previously published studies our patients with t(9;22) were younger. Furthermore, those with del(6q) were older, showing a median age equivalent to the patient group as a whole.

The diagnosis of blood disease has been modified by the ""cluster of differentiation"" (CD) nomenclature of leucocyte surface antigens, and the molecular genetics of the immune system has had a major effect on the diagnosis and treatment of blood malignancies. Lymphoid tumours represent a fertile area of interaction between immunology and haematology: B-cell malignancies are associated with dysregulation of the immune system, and antigen exposure might have an important role in the development of lymphoid malignant clones that interact with the microenvironment to avoid apoptosis and acquire better growing conditions. Understanding the pathophysiology of immune-mediated blood diseases has paved the way to the successful use of immunosuppressive agents, and the unravelling of the mechanisms of lymphocyte signal transduction and the relations between lymphocyte activation and apoptosis are allowing new therapeutic approaches.

GVHD results from a complex set of interactions between donor T cells and a variety of target tissues from the host. To gain a better understanding of the biology of the human hematopoietic system in GVHD patients, in the present study we have determined the progenitor cell content in bone marrow (BM) samples from BMT recipients, with and without GVHD, and followed their growth kinetics in Dexter-type long-term marrow cultures (LTMC). We have also assessed some aspects regarding the composition of the hematopoietic microenvironment developed in vitro. As compared to normal subjects, BMT recipients showed decreased numbers of myeloid, erythroid, and multipotent progenitor cells. Interestingly, progenitor levels were significantly lower in GVHD patients (7% of the levels in normal marrow) than in those without GVHD (44% of the levels in normal marrow). When marrow cells from BMT recipients were cultured in LTMC, hematopoiesis was sustained at lower levels and for shorter periods of time, as compared to cultures from normal subjects. The hematopoietic deficiencies observed in this in vitro system were also more pronounced in GVHD patients. In terms of the microenvironment elements, reduced numbers of fibroblastic progenitors and adherent stromal cells were observed in BMT recipients, as compared to normal subjects, who showed 7 colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F)/10(5) marrow cells and 320,000 adherent cells in LTMC. Again, GVHD patients showed more severe deficiencies (0.16 CFU-F/10(5) marrow cells and 34,000 adherent cells in LTMC) than patients without GVHD (2 CFU-F/10(5) marrow cells and 122,000 adherent cells in LTMC). Our results demonstrate that the hematopoietic system of BMT recipients is impaired, both in terms of its in vitro composition and function, and that these deficiencies are clearly more pronounced in patients with GVHD than in those without GVHD. Finally, although the evidence is still preliminary, our results also indicate that the severity of the hematopoietic alterations may be greater in acute GVHD than in chronic GVHD.","['Martinez-Jaramillo, G', 'Gomez-Morales, E', 'Sanchez-Valle, E', 'Mayani, H']","['Martinez-Jaramillo G', 'Gomez-Morales E', 'Sanchez-Valle E', 'Mayani H']","['Oncological Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",2001/07/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581601750288957 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2001 Jun;10(3):347-54. doi: 10.1089/152581601750288957.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific treatment for the leukaemia was instituted; however, all three patients died as a consequence of the liver failure. We describe the clinical course and relevant investigations of these patients and discuss possible mechanisms of acute liver failure in this setting.

The hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid (HPT) axis is exposed to irradiation when some children are treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with prophylactic cranial irradiation (CIR). Whether this treatment causes hypofunction of the HPT axis remains controversial. DESIGN: We measured plasma levels of total T3 (T3), total T4 (T4) and TSH before stimulation with TRH and plasma levels of TSH, 30 and 150 minutes after stimulation with TRH in 95 patients in first continuous remission of childhood ALL. PATIENTS: Patients diagnosed with ALL before the age of 15 years between 1970 and 1991 and who were in first continuous remission and off treatment for at least one year were studied. The children were aged between 0.5 and 14.8 years (median: 3.9) at diagnosis of ALL. Thyroid function was assessed between 1.2 and 18.3 years (median: 7.6) after completion of therapy. MEASUREMENTS: We measured T4 levels before, and compared TSH levels before and after, stimulation with TRH in patients who were treated with prophylactic CIR (15-24 Gy) (n = 38) (CIR group) with patients who were treated with chemotherapy only (n = 57) (non-CIR group). RESULTS: We found that T3 and T4 levels were normal in all individuals (excluding the women who were on oral contraceptives). The median time from end of treatment to time at follow-up was 9.1 years in the non-CIR group vs. 4.2 years in the CIR group (P < 0.001), and the effect on follow-up time was significant (P = 0.04). It was estimated that just after irradiation, the TSH levels before and 30 and 150 minutes after TRH stimulation was 49% lower in the CIR group; however, after 4.0 years, TSH levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Although within normal limits, the T4 levels were significantly higher in the CIR group compared to the non-CIR group (P = 0.003). It was estimated that, just after the end of treatment, T4 was 19.9% higher in the CIR group. However, in the CIR group, the T4 level decreased significantly over time with -1.5% per year (P = 0.025), while the difference in the non-CIR group was not significant. There was no correlation between T4 and TSH levels and sex, age at diagnosis, age at the end of treatment or age at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, in our cohort of survivors of childhood ALL, prophylactic cranial irradiation of the central nervous system did not have an adverse effect on hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid function within a median follow-up time of 8 years.","['Lando, A', 'Holm, K', 'Nysom, K', 'Rasmussen AK', 'Feldt-Rasmussen, U', 'Petersen, J H', 'Muller, J']","['Lando A', 'Holm K', 'Nysom K', 'Rasmussen AK', 'Feldt-Rasmussen U', 'Petersen JH', 'Muller J']","['Department of Growth and Reproduction, The Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, 9 Blegdamsvej, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*pathology', 'Thyroid Gland/physiopathology/*radiation effects', 'Thyrotropin/blood', 'Thyroxine/blood', 'Triiodothyronine/blood']",2001/07/17 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['cen1292 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2265.2001.01292.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2001 Jul;55(1):21-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.2001.01292.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E31 and E32 had the same plasmid profile and showed identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns after digestion of total DNA with NotI and a two-band variation after digestion with SmaI. Polymerase chain reaction experiments showed that both isolates had both the vanC-1 and vanA genes and carried a Tn1546-related transposon lacking orf1, vanY, and vanZ. The absence of these three genes was confirmed by Southern analysis with appropriate probes. Southern hybridization experiments using a vanA probe showed that this atypical Tn1546-related element appeared to be located on the chromosome. In both E31 and E32, the vanA probe hybridized to EcoRV and HindIII fragments larger in size than the hybridizing fragments observed in the VanA prototype strain Enterococcus faecium BM4147, suggesting the lack of the relevant EcoRV and HindIII restriction sites.","['Biavasco, F', 'Paladini, C', 'Vignaroli, C', 'Foglia, G', 'Manso, E', 'Varaldo, P E']","['Biavasco F', 'Paladini C', 'Vignaroli C', 'Foglia G', 'Manso E', 'Varaldo PE']","['Institute of Microbiology, University of Ancona, Italy. f.biavasco@popcsi.unian.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (VanA ligase, Bacteria)', '0 (VanC protein, Bacteria)', '61036-62-2 (Teicoplanin)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)', 'EC 6.1.- (Carbon-Oxygen Ligases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*genetics', 'Carbon-Oxygen Ligases/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Enterococcus/*drug effects/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Teicoplanin/pharmacology', 'Vancomycin/pharmacology', 'Vancomycin Resistance']",2001/07/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/pl00011270 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2001 May;20(5):309-14. doi: 10.1007/pl00011270.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By means of TUNEL assay, the nuclei displayed a characteristic morphology change, and the amount of apoptotic cells increased early and reached maximun about 39% after treatment with etoposide for 2 h. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed after treatment for 4 h. The morphological change of HL-60 cells, thus, occurred earlier than the appearance of DNA ladder. Total nuclear matrix proteins were analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differential expression of 59 nuclear matrix proteins was found in 4 h etoposide treated cells. Western blotting was then performed on three nuclear matrix acssociated proteins, PML, HSC70 and NuMA. The expression of the suppressor PML protein and heat shock protein HSC70 were significantly upregulated after etoposide treatment, while NuMA, a nuclear mitotic apparatus protein, was down regulated.

This may adversely affect the capacity of T cells to recover from chemotherapy-induced T-cell depletion and thus contribute to the prevailing immune deficiency in ALL patients. PROCEDURE: We tested the capacity of T-cells to regenerate in 18 ALL children in first clinical remission (median age 4.2 years) at the time of hematologic reconstitution after BFM-ALL induction therapy (treatment-free interval 22 days, median; range 12 to 52 days). All patients had experienced a period of leukopenia (white blood cell count [WBC] <0.95 x 10(9)/l, median) during the final four weeks of induction therapy. T-cells and T-cell subsets were examined by FACS. RESULTS: At the time of investigation the WBC was near normal (3.5 x 10(9)/l, median). Surprisingly, most cases (78%) showed a complete regeneration of T-cells and its subsets including 1) normal total (CD3+) T-cells (1635/microl, median; range 756-3440/microl); 2) normal T-helper (CD4+) cells (697/microl, median; range 128-1523/microl); and 3) normal T-cytotoxic/suppressor (CD8+) cells (686/microl, median; range 348-1540/microl). Eight patients achieved a normal CD4+/CD8+ ratio (0.8, median). Subset analyses of T-helper cells revealed a normal proportion of CD4+CD45RA+ cells (52%, median) in all but one patient below the age of 6 years, indicating an intact residual thymic activity. No correlation was observed between age at diagnosis and a normal CD4+ count (r = 0.086) or between a normal CD4+ count and a normal proportion of CD4+CD45RA+ cells r = 0.136). A long-term survey in four patients showed altered T-cells after reinduction and during maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ALL per se does not inhibit T-cell regenerative capacity. Thus, the frequently observed longlasting impairment of the T-cell system in ALL is attributable to the treatment rather than to the underlying disease.","['Moritz, B', 'Eder, J', 'Meister, B', 'Heitger, A']","['Moritz B', 'Eder J', 'Meister B', 'Heitger A']","[""University Children's Hospital Innsbruck.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Regeneration', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/07/17 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/17 10:00'],"['2001/07/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1096-911X(20010201)36:2<283::AID-MPO1066>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Feb;36(2):283-9. doi: 10.1002/1096-911X(20010201)36:2<283::AID-MPO1066>3.0.CO;2-8.,,,,,,,,,['Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Aug;39(2):147-8.

Physical examination revealed neither lymphadenopathy nor hepato-splenomegaly. Laboratory data on admission showed a white blood cell count of 1,580/microliter, a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dl, and a platelet count of 113 x 10(3)/microliter. A small percentage of abnormal mononuclear cells were present in the peripheral blood. A bone marrow biopsy specimen demonstrated myelofibrosis and diffuse infiltration of abnormal monoculear cells with a mature B cell phenotype. A bone marrow aspirate showed 29% abnormal mononuclear cells, which had an indented or folded nucleus and reticular nuclear chromatin. Moderate to strong tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase activity was detected in these cells. Although the cytoplasmic projections were poorly preserved in specimens stained with May-Giemsa, fresh preparations showed numerous slender cytoplasmic projections by phase-contrast microscopy. The hairy cells had the phenotype CD5-, CD10-, CD11c+, CD19+, CD20+, CD25+, lambda. The patient was diagnosed as having European-American-type hairy cell leukemia (HCL) without splenomegaly, which is quite rare in Japan. The value of phase-contrast microscopy for recognition of the hairy cells was emphasized.

One potential benefit is a reduction in the deleterious effects of transfusion immunomodulation. In the surgical setting, transfusion immunomodulation has been linked to increases in postoperative infections and decreases in host cellular immunity that are mitigated by WBC reduction of transfused blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of the medical records of 68 consecutive children undergoing induction therapy for newly diagnosed ALL from 1988 through 1995, a period whose midpoint is 1991, the year WBC reduction was introduced in this hospital. RESULTS: WBC reduction of platelet and RBC transfusions was associated with fewer days with fever (mean, 5.7 days [no WBC reduction] and 2.1 days [WBC reduction]; p = 0.012) and days with positive microbial cultures (mean, 1.5 [no WBC reduction] and 0.71 [WBC reduction]; p = 0.0055). There were more high-risk ALL patients in the group receiving WBC-reduced transfusions. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic WBCs in transfused blood may cause impairment of host defenses against microbial infection during induction therapy for childhood ALL.","['Rios, J A', 'Korones, D N', 'Heal, J M', 'Blumberg, N']","['Rios JA', 'Korones DN', 'Heal JM', 'Blumberg N']","['Transfusion Medicine Unit, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['*Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukapheresis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",2001/07/14 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.2001.41070873.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2001 Jul;41(7):873-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2001.41070873.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we asked if leukotriene A(4) hydrolase co-localizes with 5-lipoxygenase in different types of leukocytes. Examination of rat basophilic leukemia cells by both immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed that leukotriene A(4) hydrolase, like 5-lipoxygenase, was most abundant in the nucleus, with only minor occurrences in the cytoplasm. The finding of abundant leukotriene A(4) hydrolase in the soluble nuclear fraction was substantiated by two different cell fractionation techniques. Leukotriene A(4) hydrolase was also found to accumulate together with 5-lipoxygenase in the nucleus of alveolar macrophages. This result was obtained using both in situ and ex vivo techniques. In contrast to these results, peripheral blood neutrophils contained both leukotriene A(4) hydrolase and 5-lipoxygenase exclusively in the cytoplasm. After adherence of neutrophils, 5-lipoxygenase was rapidly imported into the nucleus, whereas leukotriene A(4) hydrolase remained cytosolic. Similarly, 5-lipoxygenase was localized in the nucleus of neutrophils recruited into inflamed appendix tissue, whereas leukotriene A(4) hydrolase remained cytosolic. These results demonstrate for the first time that leukotriene A(4) hydrolase can be accumulated in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with 5-lipoxygenase. As with 5-lipoxygenase, the subcellular distribution of leukotriene A(4) hydrolase is cell-specific and dynamic, but differences in the mechanisms regulating nuclear import must exist. The degree to which these two enzymes are co-localized may influence their metabolic coupling in the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B(4).","['Brock, T G', 'Maydanski, E', 'McNish, R W', 'Peters-Golden, M']","['Brock TG', 'Maydanski E', 'McNish RW', 'Peters-Golden M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0642, USA. brocko@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'V38765PUZ6 (leukotriene A4 hydrolase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",2001/07/14 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M105676200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)77103-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Sep 14;276(37):35071-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M105676200.

Pretreatment of HIV-1(NL4-3) with SLS decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, its infectivity when using 1G5 as target cells. In the absence of a viral pretreatment period or when 1G5 cells were pretreated with SLS, the surfactant-induced inactivation of viral infectivity was less pronounced, especially at concentrations between 375 and 550 microM. SLS had no effect on HIV-1 when the virus was adsorbed to 1G5 cells by a 2-h incubation period. SLS almost completely inhibited the fusion process by decreasing the attachment of HIV-1 to target cells. SLS also inhibited the infectivity of HIV-1-based luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope (which enters cells in a CD4-, CCR5-, and CXCR4-independent manner), indicating that SLS may inactivate other envelope viruses. In contrast, no effect was seen with vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (which enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis) pretreated with up to 700 microM SLS. SLS also decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, the HIV-1-dependent syncytium formation between 1G5 and J1.1 cells after a 24-h incubation. The reduction of luciferase activity was more pronounced when J1.1 cells (which express HIV-1 proteins on their surface) were pretreated with SLS rather than 1G5 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that SLS could represent a candidate of choice for use in vaginal microbicides to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and possibly other pathogens causing sexually transmitted diseases.","['Bestman-Smith, J', 'Piret, J', 'Desormeaux, A', 'Tremblay, M J', 'Omar, R F', 'Bergeron, M G']","['Bestman-Smith J', 'Piret J', 'Desormeaux A', 'Tremblay MJ', 'Omar RF', 'Bergeron MG']","['Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genes, Viral', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases/prevention & control', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/*pharmacology', 'Surface-Active Agents/*pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virion/physiology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2001/07/14 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.45.8.2229-2237.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Aug;45(8):2229-37. doi: 10.1128/AAC.45.8.2229-2237.2001.,PMC90636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The helper virus provides the retroviral proteins necessary for particle production and infection. These include the envelope glycoproteins that specifically bind to cell surface receptors and mediate viral adsorption and entry. Thus, a particular helper virus may influence the nature of disease induced by an oncogene-containing retrovirus due to tissue tropism of the helper. In a previous study, a replication-defective recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus containing the v-myc oncogene was generated (M-MuLV(myc); Brightman B.K., Pattengale P.K., and Fan H., J Virol 60: 68-81, 1986). When M-MuLV(myc) was inoculated into mice using the non-pathogenic amphotropic murine leukemia virus (Am-MuLV 4070) as a helper, T- and B-lymphoblastic lymphomas resulted with the following two surface phenotypes, namely, (1) Thy 1.2+, B220- and (2) Thy 1.2-, B220+. Thy 1.2 surface antigen is characteristic of cells of the lymphoid lineage, whereas B220 surface antigen is characteristic of cells of the B-lymphoid lineage. In these experiments, to assess the influence of the helper virus on the disease specificity of M-MuLV(myc), two weakly pathogenic ecotropic helper MuLVs that interact with different cell surface receptors than Am-MuLV (Mo+PyF101 and AKV MuLV) were used to pseudotype M-MuLV(myc). In both cases, when inoculated into mice, these pseudotypes induced only T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. These results indicate that for M-MuLV(myc) the types of the tumors induced are influenced by the helper virus utilized, and they suggest that different lymphoid cells may express different levels of retroviral receptors.","['Granger, S W', 'Fan, H']","['Granger SW', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine 92697-3900, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genes, myc', 'Helper Viruses/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology/virology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology']",2001/07/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011166323566 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2001 Jun;22(3):311-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1011166323566.,,,,['T32 CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral protein, Tax, immortalizes human T-cells and inhibits various types of apoptosis, and is thought to play crucial roles in the development of ATL. We have recently demonstrated that Tax induces the constitutive expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL, in a mouse T-cell line. The mouse, however, is not a natural host of HTLV-I, and HTLV-I does not induce this malignancy in mice. We thus examined whether Tax also activates the expression of Bcl-xL in human T-cells. Expression of Tax in a human T-cell line, Jurkat, induced the expression of the Bcl-xL gene, but did not significantly affect the expression of the other apoptosis-related genes, Bcl-2 and Bax. Transient transfection assays showed that Tax stimulated human Bcl-xL promoter activity in Jurkat cells. Deletion of the two potential nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB binding sites in the human Bcl-xL promoter significantly decreased Tax-induced transactivation. In addition to NF-kappaB, Tax activates transcription through the c-AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). Tax mutants segregating these two pathways showed that both the NF-kappaB and CREB pathways of Tax are required for maximum activation of a human Bcl-xL promoter, nevertheless, NF-kappaB alone was sufficient for that of a mouse Bcl-xL promoter. Northern blot analysis showed that all the human T-cell lines expressing Tax had higher levels of Bcl-xL mRNA than HTLV-I-uninfected ones. Furthermore, the sample from one patient with ATL expressed higher levels of Bcl-xL mRNA compared with levels from uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results suggest that Tax induces the expression of Bc-xL through the NF-kappaB and CREB pathways in HTLV-I-infected human T-cells, and then inhibits apoptosis, and such inhibition is necessary for the infected cells to advance to the leukemia in vivo.","['Mori, N', 'Fujii, M', 'Cheng, G', 'Ikeda, S', 'Yamasaki, Y', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Mori N', 'Fujii M', 'Cheng G', 'Ikeda S', 'Yamasaki Y', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Japan. n-mori@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/07/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011158021749 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2001 Jun;22(3):279-87. doi: 10.1023/a:1011158021749.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As little is known about VNR activity on human leukemia, we studied its in vitro cytotoxic effect on human leukemia cell lines (FLG 29.1, HL60, K562, Balm 4, CEM and Daudi) and on fresh leukemia cells from 28 patients: 2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML); 3 chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP); 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 18 B-chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL), employing the colorimetric INT assay and determining the IC50. We observed that VNR exerts its cytotoxic activity on leukemic cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion. The lymphoid cell lines appear more sensitive than the myeloid ones to the VNR-dependent growth inhibition. A similar pattern was noticed for leukemia cells in primary cultures.

In addition, the economic impact of antibiotic treatment should always be evaluated, especially in developing countries. In our center between January 1998 and January 1999, 73 children with hematological malignancies [acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML)]; 9 children with solid tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma) had 87 febrile neutropenic episodes (related to chemotherapy). These children were randomized prospectively into three treatment groups. The first group (n: 28) received cefepime plus netilmicin, while the second group (n: 29) was treated with ceftazidime plus amikacin and the third (n: 30) with meropenem as monotherapy. The aim of the study was to compare the success rates and cost of fourth generation cephalosporin plus aminoglycoside and monotherapy of meropenem with ceftazidime plus amikacin, which is the standard therapy for febrile neutropenia. Microbiologically documented infections were 29.9%, clinically documented infections were 9.2% and 60.9% of the febrile neutropenic episodes were considered to be FUO. Gram-positive microorganisms were the most commonly isolated agents from blood cultures [MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in 6 patients and MSSA (Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) in 4 patients]. The success rates were 78.5%, 79.3% and 73.3 % for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd groups respectively. In 4 patients (4.5%) fever responded only to amphotericin-B therapy. There was no statistically significant difference between the three treatment regimens with respect to efficacy, safety and tolerance (chi2 test, p>0.05), but while the third and fourth generation cephalosporins + aminoglycosides were comparable for cost, the monotherapy regimen was the most expensive. The main determining factors for the choice of treatment of febrile neutropenic children, especially in a developing country, are cost, presence of indwelling catheter and the bacterial flora of the unit, as well as efficacy.","['Agaoglu, L', 'Devecioglu, O', 'Anak, S', 'Karakas, Z', 'Yalman, N', 'Biner, B', 'Eryilmaz, E', 'Goksan, B', 'Unuvar, A', 'Agirbasli, H', 'Can, M', 'Bilgen, H', 'Gedikoglu, G']","['Agaoglu L', 'Devecioglu O', 'Anak S', 'Karakas Z', 'Yalman N', 'Biner B', 'Eryilmaz E', 'Goksan B', 'Unuvar A', 'Agirbasli H', 'Can M', 'Bilgen H', 'Gedikoglu G']","['Istanbul University, Istanbul School of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,"['0 (Cephalosporins)', '0 (Thienamycins)', '4O5J85GJJB (Netilmicin)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', 'FV9J3JU8B1 (Meropenem)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amikacin/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cefepime', 'Cephalosporins/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Meropenem', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Netilmicin/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thienamycins/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Turkey']",2001/07/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/joc.2001.13.3.281 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chemother. 2001 Jun;13(3):281-7. doi: 10.1179/joc.2001.13.3.281.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective recruitment of Afro-Caribbean donors is therefore necessary but was considered to pose an increased risk of human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) infection. To assess this a seroprevalence study of HTLV was undertaken in Afro-Caribbean and Caucasian donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sera from 1100 Afro-Caribbean and 1100 Caucasian donors were tested for antibody to HTLV. Reactive samples were confirmed for specificity using an algorithm comprising two additional assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where possible. RESULTS: Six Afro-Caribbean donors (0.55%) were considered to be infected with HTLV I. CONCLUSION: Donor selection in this case caused a significantly elevated prevalence of HTLV infection and serves as a warning of the need for care in the design of policies for selective donor recruitment.,"['Price, J', 'Cant, B A', 'Barbara, J A', 'Tedder, R S']","['Price J', 'Cant BA', 'Barbara JA', 'Tedder RS']","['National Blood Service, South Thames, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Africa/ethnology', '*Blood Donors', '*Ethnicity', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*ethnology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Mass Screening', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'RNA, Viral/*blood', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Risk', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Viremia/*ethnology/prevention & control/transmission', 'West Indies/ethnology', 'Whites']",2001/07/14 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1423-0410.2001.00030.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vox Sang. 2001 Apr;80(3):148-50. doi: 10.1046/j.1423-0410.2001.00030.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest that M. fortuitum and M. chelonae groups, in spite of the fact that they rarely cause infection, have a significant risk of infecting aged patients in general hospitals with various underlying diseases attributable to infections. As only a few colonies were isolated from patients' specimens in the majority of cases, it took time to carry out these clinical examinations, and to improve this ""laboratory's delay"", it is needed to make faster report to clinicians.","['Tazawa, S', 'Marumo, K', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Narushima, M', 'Higuchi, D']","['Tazawa S', 'Marumo K', 'Nakamura Y', 'Narushima M', 'Higuchi D']","['Division of Central Clinical Laboratory, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Kekkaku,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],0422132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Hospitals, General', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', '*Laboratories, Hospital', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium/*isolation & purification', 'Mycobacterium Infections/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Outpatients']",2001/07/14 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/14 10:00'],"['2001/07/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Kekkaku. 2001 May;76(5):419-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current methods are not sensitive in detecting micro metastases. Tyrosinase mRNA can be detected in peripheral blood by a molecular test. As tyrosinase is expressed only in melanocytes and melanocytes normally do not circulate in the blood, the test may prove reliable in detecting circulating melanoma cells. METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: we used a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detecting tyrosinase mRNA in the blood. A prospective investigation in melanoma patients undergoing surgery was conducted; follow-up duration was 12 months. SETTING: University Department Laboratory and Melanoma Clinic of a Tertiary Hospital. PATIENTS: a total of 27 Greek patients with a diagnosis of malignant melanoma at different stages of the disease; 12 months follow-up after surgery. Samples form 12 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia served as controls. INTERVENTIONS: none. MEASURES: none. RESULTS: We detected mRNA tyrosinase in the peripheral blood in 16 out of 27 melanoma patients studied. No tyrosinase mRNA was detected in any of the 25 samples from the controls. Two of the 16 positive cases developed a metastasis within the next 12 months following testing. The other 14 positive cases remain metastasis free for this period, as also did the test negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of blood circulating melanoma cells by a RT-PCR technique, may be helpful in defining melanoma patients who are at risk for the spread of the disease.","['Konstantopoulos, K', 'Psatha, M', 'Kalotychou, V', 'Frangia, N', 'Ioannovits, I', 'Meletis, I', 'Loukopoulos, D']","['Konstantopoulos K', 'Psatha M', 'Kalotychou V', 'Frangia N', 'Ioannovits I', 'Meletis I', 'Loukopoulos D']","['University of Athens School of Medicine, First Department of Medicine, Laikon Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Panminerva Med,Panminerva medica,0421110,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.14.18.1 (Monophenol Monooxygenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Monophenol Monooxygenase/genetics', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Reference Values', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/07/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/13 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Panminerva Med. 2001 Jun;43(2):109-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased sensitivity of acute myelogenous leukemias to lovastatin-induced apoptosis: a potential therapeutic approach. Blood, 93: 1308-1318, 1999) that lovastatin, a prototypic member of the statin family, can induce apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in a sensitive and specific manner. In the present study, we evaluated the relative potency and mechanism of action of the newer synthetic statins, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin, to trigger tumor-specific apoptosis. Cerivastatin is at least 10 times more potent than the other statins at inducing apoptosis in AML cell lines. Cerivastatin-induced apoptosis is reversible with the addition of the immediate product of the HMG-CoA reductase reaction, mevalonate, or with a distal product of the pathway, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. This suggests protein geranylgeranylation is an essential downstream component of the mevalonate pathway for cerivastatin similar to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. The enhanced potency of cerivastatin expands the number of AML patient samples as well as the types of malignancies, which respond to statin-induced apoptosis with acute sensitivity. Cells derived from acute lymphocytic leukemia are only weakly sensitive to lovastatin cytotoxicity but show robust response to cerivastatin. Importantly, cerivastatin is not cytotoxic to nontransformed human bone marrow progenitors. These results strongly support the further testing of cerivastatin as a novel anticancer therapeutic alone and in combination with other agents in vivo.","['Wong, W W', 'Tan, M M', 'Xia, Z', 'Dimitroulakos, J', 'Minden, M D', 'Penn, L Z']","['Wong WW', 'Tan MM', 'Xia Z', 'Dimitroulakos J', 'Minden MD', 'Penn LZ']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, The Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '4L066368AS (Fluvastatin)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'AM91H2KS67 (cerivastatin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Atorvastatin', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/pharmacology', 'Fluvastatin', 'Heptanoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/13 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/07/13 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Jul;7(7):2067-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we measured VEGF levels in plasma prospectively collected from patients enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9480, an intergroup study of suramin in patients with HRPC, to determine whether these levels had prognostic significance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pretreatment plasma was collected from patients with HRPC enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9480. In a subset of samples representative of the entire cohort, plasma VEGF levels were determined in duplicate using a Quantiglo chemiluminescent ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Statistical analyses were performed to determine the correlation between pretreatment plasma VEGF levels and time of overall survival. The proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic significance of various cut points in multivariate models. RESULTS: Plasma VEGF levels in this population ranged from 4-885 pg/ml, with a median level of 83 pg/ml. As a continuous variable, plasma VEGF levels inversely correlated with survival time (P = 0.002). Using various exploratory cut points, plasma VEGF levels appeared to correlate with survival. In multivariate models in which other prognostic factors (serum prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, evidence of measurable disease, and hemoglobin) were included, plasma VEGF levels were significant at various cut points tested. CONCLUSION: Although these data are exploratory and need to be confirmed in an independent data set, they suggest that VEGF may have clinical significance in patients with HRPC.","['George, D J', 'Halabi, S', 'Shepard, T F', 'Vogelzang, N J', 'Hayes, D F', 'Small, E J', 'Kantoff, P W']","['George DJ', 'Halabi S', 'Shepard TF', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Hayes DF', 'Small EJ', 'Kantoff PW']","['Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/07/13 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/07/13 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Jul;7(7):1932-6.,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9480'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported that verapamil, an inhibitor of drug transport, caused a decrease in cellular glutathione in CCRF-CEM/E1000 MRP1-overexpressing leukaemia cells (Biochem Pharmacol 55;1283--9, 1998). We now demonstrate that other inhibitors of MRP1-mediated drug transport (e.g. MK571, indomethacin, genistein, and nifedipine) deplete cellular glutathione in these leukaemia cells (>30% decrease; P < 0.01) while having no effect on the parental CCRF-CEM cells. However, treatment with etoposide or vincristine (at similar molar concentrations) caused a 20% decrease in glutathione. Verapamil-stimulated glutathione transport correlated with MRP1 expression in a series of drug-resistant cells, and glutathione was quantitatively recovered in the extracellular media. Further, verapamil-stimulated glutathione transport was rapid (50% decrease in 10 min), dose-dependent, and inhibited by vanadate, an inhibitor of ATPase activity, but not by sulphobromophthalein (BSP) or methionine, inhibitors of hepatic glutathione transporters. Incubation of CCRF-CEM/E1000 cells in 25 mM glutathione not only showed that verapamil-mediated efflux occurred against the concentration gradient, but also demonstrated the MRP1-mediated uptake of glutathione (P < 0.01 compared to the parental CCRF-CEM cells), which was not inhibited by vanadate. These results demonstrate that while MRP1 transports glutathione in the presence of inhibitors of drug transport, there is no convincing evidence for co-transport of glutathione with drug. They further demonstrate that MRP1 mediates the facilitated transport of glutathione into the MRP1-overexpressing CEM/E1000 cells, suggesting that MRP1 may play a major role in cellular glutathione homeostasis.","['Cullen, K V', 'Davey, R A', 'Davey, M W']","['Cullen KV', 'Davey RA', 'Davey MW']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Department, University of Technology, Sydney, Gore Hill 2065, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",2001/07/13 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/07/13 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(01)00681-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00681-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Aug 15;62(4):417-24. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00681-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the hydroxylated DENSPM compounds, both cyclopropyl norspermines substantially upregulated spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase. The most interesting effect of hydroxylating CPMENSPM is the profound reduction in toxicity compared with that of the parent drug.

Evidence is emerging that this cytokine may play an important role in regulating the neural-immune system interaction during acute inflammatory insult and the subsequent healing and restitution process. However, LIF may act as either a pro- or antiinflammatory cytokine, depending on the cell type and a number of other variables. In this review, the role of LIF in airway inflammation and resolution of inflammation is discussed. In particular, recent work suggesting that LIF is a mediator of bi-directional cross-talk between neural tissue and the immune system is highlighted.","['Knight, D']",['Knight D'],"['Asthma & Allergy Research Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia. dknight@cyllene.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Pulm Pharmacol Ther,Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics,9715279,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelium/pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Inflammation', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lung/innervation', 'Lymphokines/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction']",2001/07/13 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/13 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/pupt.2001.0282 [doi]', 'S1094-5539(01)90282-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Pulm Pharmacol Ther. 2001;14(3):169-76. doi: 10.1006/pupt.2001.0282.,,,,,61,,['Copyright Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

These cytokines stimulate proliferation of the cells and inhibit the secretion of PRL by 70-80% and that of GH by 50%. They induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the cells. The cells containing PRL or GH decreased at 48 h after treatment of the cells with LIF or IL-6.

We wish to report here the isolation, characterisation and expression of the full length cDNA for another ribosomal protein, the L35a (rpL35a), in MEL cells. This cDNA shares significant structural homology in both DNA and protein levels to genes encoding the rat and human L35a ribosomal proteins. Northern blot hybridisation analysis has shown that the steady-state level of rpL35a mRNA is progressively reduced during differentiation of MEL cells along the erythrocytic maturation pathway induced by DMSO or UDP-4, two structurally unrelated inducers of differentiation. However, in cells where differentiation was inhibited by N(6)-methyladenosine, the level of rpL35a RNA transcripts was not affected. In addition, rpL35a gene expression was not altered in apoptotic MEL cells. Furthermore, the suppression of L35a gene was not correlated to any change in DNA methylation at CCGG sites located at the rpL35a gene locus in undifferentiated and differentiated MEL cells, as we observed for the rpS5 gene. Overall, these data suggest that the expression of ribosomal genes, the L35a of 60S ribosomal subunit and the S5 of 40S ribosomal subunit, are regulated by a common mechanism in differentiating MEL cells, leading to the observed decrease in ribosomal function.","['Pappas, I S', 'Vizirianakis, I S', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S']","['Pappas IS', 'Vizirianakis IS', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-540 06 Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Rpl35a protein, mouse)', '141766-10-1 (2-(3-ethylureido)-6-methylpyridine)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2001/07/13 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/13 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cbir.2000.0695 [doi]', 'S1065-6995(00)90695-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2001;25(7):629-34. doi: 10.1006/cbir.2000.0695.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,['GENBANK/Y16430'],,,,,,,

The in vitro amplification of tumor-specific DNA or RNA sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows identification of a few neoplastic cells in 10(4) to 10(6) normal cells. Depending on the underlying malignant disease and therapeutic treatment, the presence of residual tumor cells in an individual patient may herald relapse, but a long-term stable situation or slowly vanishing tumor cells are also possible. Molecular monitoring of residual leukemia and lymphoma cells by quantitative PCR techniques has provided important information about the effectiveness of treatment and the risk of recurrent disease as shown by minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis in patients with various malignant diseases. Such diseases include childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, after induction therapy; acute promyelocytic leukemia, during and after chemotherapy; and chronic myelogenous leukemia, during treatment with alpha-interferon and after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Evaluation of the predictive value of the detection of MRD has to take into account its evolution and course, the pathogenesis, biology, and natural course of the underlying malignant disease, the molecular genetic lesion, and finally, the type of treatment. Quantification of minimal residual cells by the recently developed real-time quantitative PCR technique will surely have a major impact on our therapeutic strategies for patients with leukemia, lymphomas, and solid tumors.

Third, we found that the majority of cells spontaneously expressed oligodendrocytic markers (CNPase, A2B5, GalC) when cultured at low density.","['Hugnot, J P', 'Pilcher, H', 'Rashid-Doubell, F', 'Sinden, J', 'Price, J']","['Hugnot JP', 'Pilcher H', 'Rashid-Doubell F', 'Sinden J', 'Price J']","['Institute of Psychiatry, Denmark Hill, SE5 8AF, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neuroreport,Neuroreport,9100935,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fgfbp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/metabolism', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Hippocampus/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neuroglia/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Oligodendroglia/drug effects/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology']",2001/07/12 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001756-200107200-00038 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuroreport. 2001 Jul 20;12(10):2237-41. doi: 10.1097/00001756-200107200-00038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the incidence of disease in humans due to this pathogen is still very low. This study set out to investigate if there is a difference between strains isolated from human disease cases and those isolated from asymptomatic cattle which would account for the low disease incidence of such a ubiquitous organism. The work presented here has compared human disease strains from both sporadic and outbreak cases with a cross-section, as defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, of E. coli O157 strains from cattle. Human (n = 22) and bovine (n = 31) strains were genotyped for carriage of the genes for Shiga-like toxin types 1, 2, and 2c; E. coli secreted protein genes espA, espB, and espP; the enterohemolysin gene; eae (intimin); ast (enteroaggregative E. coli stable toxin [EAST]); and genes for common E. coli adhesins. Strains were also phenotyped for hemolysin, EspP, Tir, and EspD expression as well as production of actin and cytoskeletal rearrangement associated with attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on HeLa cells. The genotyping confirmed that there was little difference between the two groups, including carriage of stx(2) and stx(2c), which was similar in both sets. ast alleles were confirmed to all contain mutations that would prevent EAST expression. espP mutations were found only in cattle strains (5 of 30). Clear differences were observed in the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded factors between strains and in different media. EspD, as an indicator of LEE4 (espA, -B, and -D) expression, and Tir levels in supernatants were measured. Virtually all strains from both sources could produce EspD in Luria-Bertani broth, although at very different levels. Standard trichloroacetic acid precipitation of secreted proteins from tissue culture medium produced detectable levels of EspD from the majority of strains of human origin (15 of 20) compared with only a few (4 of 20) bovine strains (P < 0.001), which is indicative of much higher levels of protein secretion from the human strains. Addition of bovine serum albumin carrier protein before precipitation and enhanced detection techniques confirmed that EspD could be detected after growth in tissue culture medium for all strains, but levels from strains of human origin were on average 90-fold higher than those from strains of bovine origin. In general, levels of secretion also correlated with ability to form A/E lesions on HeLa cells, with only the high-level protein secretors in tissue culture medium exhibiting a localized adherence phenotype. This research shows significant differences between human- and bovine-derived E. coli O157 (stx(+) eae(+)) strains and their production of certain LEE-encoded virulence factors. These data support the recent finding of Kim et al. (J. Kim, J. Nietfeldt, and A. K. Benson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:13288-13293, 1999) proposing different E. coli O157 lineages in cattle and humans and extend the differential to the regulation of virulence factors. Potentially only a subset of E. coli O157 isolates (stx(+) eae(+)) in cattle may be capable of causing severe disease in humans.","['McNally, A', 'Roe, A J', 'Simpson, S', 'Thomson-Carter, F M', 'Hoey, D E', 'Currie, C', 'Chakraborty, T', 'Smith, D G', 'Gally, D L']","['McNally A', 'Roe AJ', 'Simpson S', 'Thomson-Carter FM', 'Hoey DE', 'Currie C', 'Chakraborty T', 'Smith DG', 'Gally DL']","['ZAP Laboratories, Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Adhesins, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (EHEC-hlyA protein, E coli)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 1)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (EspP protein, E coli)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Adhesins, Bacterial/genetics', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/*genetics', 'Bacterial Toxins/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enterocytes', 'Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology/veterinary', 'Escherichia coli O157/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics', '*Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics', 'Shiga Toxin 1/genetics', 'Shiga Toxin 2/genetics']",2001/07/12 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/IAI.69.8.5107-5114.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 2001 Aug;69(8):5107-14. doi: 10.1128/IAI.69.8.5107-5114.2001.,PMC98606,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['McNally A, Roe AJ, Simpson S, Thomson-Carter FM, Hoey DE, Currie C, Chakraborty', 'T, Smith DG, Gally DL.

Such tumor cells and membranes may serve, in cancer patients, as autologous tumor vaccines that are targeted in vivo to antigen-presenting cells by the anti-Gal antibody. This ralpha1,3GT lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, ensuring its solubility without detergent. It is effectively produced in P. pastoris under constitutive expression of the P(GAP) promoter and is secreted into the culture medium in a soluble, truncated form fused to a (His)(6) tag. This tag enables the simple affinity purification of ralpha1,3GT on a nickel-Sepharose column and elution with imidazole. The purified enzyme appears in SDS-PAGE as two bands with the size of 40 and 41 kDa and displays the same acceptor specificity as the mammalian native enzyme. ralpha1,3GT is very effective in synthesizing alpha-gal epitopes on membrane-bound carbohydrate chains and displays a specific activity of 1.2 nM membrane bound alpha-gal epitopes/min/mg. Incubation of very large amounts of human acute myeloid leukemia cells (1 x 10(9 )cells) with neuraminidase, ralpha1,3GT, and UDP-Gal resulted in the synthesis of approximately 6 x 10(6 )alpha-gal epitopes per cell. Effective synthesis of alpha-gal epitopes could be achieved also with as much as 2 g cell membranes prepared from the tumor of a patient with ovarian carcinoma. These data imply that ralpha1,3GT produced in P. pastoris is suitable for the synthesis of alpha-gal epitopes on bulk amounts of tumor cells or cell membranes required for the preparation of autologous tumor vaccines.","['Chen, Z C', 'Tanemura, M', 'Galili, U']","['Chen ZC', 'Tanemura M', 'Galili U']","['Department of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgery, Rush University, 1653 West Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (1,3-alpha-D-glucan synthase)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucosyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligosaccharides/*biosynthesis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Pichia/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism']",2001/07/12 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/glycob/11.7.577 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycobiology. 2001 Jul;11(7):577-86. doi: 10.1093/glycob/11.7.577.,,,,['CA85868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rev. Toxicol. 24, 177-209, 1994). Aplastic anemia has been demonstrated in animal models following benzene exposure but, heretofore, it has not been possible to replicate benzene-induced granulocytic leukemia in animals. The Tg.AC mouse appears to be the first animal model in which a granulocytic leukemia was produced by treatment with benzene (Tennant et al., The Use of Short- and Medium-Term Tests for Carcinogenic Hazard Evaluation, 1999; French and Saulnier, J. Toxicol. Environ. Health 61, 377-379, 2000). Leukemia was observed in Tg.AC mice to which benzene was administered dermally. Neither orally dosed Tg.AC mice or mice of the parental FVB strain treated by either route of exposure developed leukemia. It is well established that benzene metabolism is required to produce benzene toxicity. To determine whether metabolic differences arising from differences in route of exposure or strain of mouse directed the development of leukemia, the pharmacokinetics of benzene were compared between the two strains and between the two routes of administration. Regardless of the route of exposure or the strain of mouse, seven major metabolites plus unmetabolized benzene were detected in most samples at most time points. Few differences were observed between the two strains following either route of administration. These results suggest that the genetic modification in the Tg.AC mouse, i.e., insertion of the v-Ha-ras construct into the genome, did not disrupt any major pathways involved in determining the pharmacokinetics of benzene. Two significant differences were observed between the two routes of exposure: first, benzene was absorbed more slowly after intradermal injection than after oral gavage, and second, the intradermally dosed mice produced more conjugates of hydroquinone than did the orally dosed mice. These differences in metabolism may be involved in the previously observed differences in hematotoxicity between the two routes of exposure.","['Hoffmann, M J', 'Sinko, P J', 'Lee, Y H', 'Meeker, R J', 'Snyder, R']","['Hoffmann MJ', 'Sinko PJ', 'Lee YH', 'Meeker RJ', 'Snyder R']","['Joint Graduate Program in Toxicology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854-8020, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Hydroquinones/blood', 'Injections, Intradermal', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Tissue Distribution']",2001/07/12 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/taap.2001.9203 [doi]', 'S0041-008X(01)99203-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2001 Jul 15;174(2):139-45. doi: 10.1006/taap.2001.9203.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

A reduced carbon monoxide diffusion capacity and partial respiratory insufficiency were noted. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and pulmonary infiltrates could not be detected. Respiratory infections, thromboembolic causes or autoimmune diseases were carefully ruled out. IFN-alpha was suspected as causative agent, because experimental investigations in sheep showed that IFN-alpha can stimulate the thromboxane cascade which resulted in transient PAH. A reduced pulmonary diffusion capacity had been observed secondary to PAH. After discontinuation of IFN-alpha, our patient's clinical status improved rapidly. After 6 months the pulmonary artery pressure had returned to near normal values (35 mmHg) and the pulmonary diffusion capacity was normal. It took one year until the electrocardiogram reverted to the pre-IFN-alpha pattern.

Diagnoses were established according to FAB criteria (RARS, n=37; RA, n=53; RAEB, n=50; RAEB-t, n=19; CMML, n=21). Six different multiparameter scoring systems (the Mufti, Aul, Sanz, Morel, and Toyama scores, and the international prognostic scoring system [IPSS]) were applied. The Aul, Sanz, and Mufti scores were applied to all 180 patients, Morel and Toyama scores to 109 patients, and the IPSS to 102. As assessed by multivariate analysis, the percentage of bm-blasts, hemoglobin, platelet count, neutrophil count, LDH, and karyotype were found to be independent single variables for survival, and bm-blasts, neutrophil count, platelet count, and karyotype for AML evolution. All prognostic scoring systems applied appeared to be highly predictive for survival and AML development (P<0.001). The highest predictive values were found for the Aul, Sanz, and Toyama scores for overall survival, and the IPSS, Toyama, and Morel scores for AML-free survival. In summary, our data show that scoring systems are useful for predicting overall and AML-free survival in patients with MDS. Karyotype-based multiparameter systems appear to be particularly effective in defining MDS patients who are at high risk of transforming to leukemia.","['Sperr, W R', 'Wimazal, F', 'Kundi, M', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer, R', 'Schernthaner, G H', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Haas, O A', 'Geissler, K', 'Lechner, K', 'Valent, P']","['Sperr WR', 'Wimazal F', 'Kundi M', 'Fonatsch C', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer R', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Haas OA', 'Geissler K', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@univie.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/diagnosis/*mortality', '*Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/07/12 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770000280 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001 May;80(5):272-7. doi: 10.1007/s002770000280.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The correlation between automated counts and the standard method was poor. The regression was y = 9.63 + 0.94x, r2 = 0.86. For platelet counts <20 x 10(9)/L the maximal deviation was 37 x 10(9)/L; on average, 7 x 10(9)/L platelets were counted in excess when compared with the standard method. PCW, in contrast to the automated impedance method, discriminated platelets from nonplatelet particles such as debris, fragments of red blood cells (hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS]) and of blast cells, and identified platelets of abnormal size. In addition, the appearance ofplatelets, WBCs, and RBCs gave clues to the etiology of thrombocytopenia, such as leukemia, infection, HUS, familial macrothrombocytopenia, and immune thrombocytopenia. PCW is a fast, reliable platelet counting method requiring less experience than the phase-contrast method. Visual evaluation from a stained smear clearly differentiates platelets and nonplatelet particles in contrast to most automated counters. In addition, the original smear can be preserved and reevaluated.","['Sutor, A H', 'Grohmann, A', 'Kaufmehl, K', 'Wundisch, T']","['Sutor AH', 'Grohmann A', 'Kaufmehl K', 'Wundisch T']","['Universitats-Kinderklinik, Freiburg, Germany. sutor@kikli.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,,IM,"['Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Platelet Count/instrumentation/*methods/standards', 'Reference Standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Thrombocytopenia/*blood/diagnosis', 'Time Factors']",2001/07/12 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2001/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2001-15253 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2001 Jun;27(3):237-43. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-15253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spanish language versions of questionnaires for proxy assessors, based on the Health Utilities Index (HUI), were used to elicit responses from parents and physicians. The HUI is a family of multi-attribute, generic, preference-linked measures of health status and health-related quality of life that are reliable, responsive and valid, and have been used previously in pediatric oncology. Valid responses were received from 178 parents and 144 physicians in 6 centres in 4 countries (Cuba, Honduras, Colombia and Uruguay). For children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia the major morbidity burdens were in the attributes of emotion, cognition and pain. The overall burden of morbidity was greater in children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In survivors of Hodgkin's disease and Wilms' tumor the attributes most affected were emotion and pain. In general, there was considerable agreement between the assessments provided independently by parents and physicians.

We describe herein a new analytical method, based on infrared (IR) spectroscopy, to estimate the percentage of apoptotic leukemic cells in two different cell lines (CEM and K562), induced with etoposide (VP-16). As the percentage of apoptosis increases, the protein structure shifts from dominantly beta-sheet to unordered (random coil), the overall lipid content increases and the amount of detectable DNA decreases. These changes can be directly related to the percentage of apoptosis as determined by two standard reference methods: flow cytometry and DNA ladder formation. The correlation between the significant IR spectral changes and the percentage of apoptotic leukemia cells in the two cell lines was optimal up to 24 h following etoposide treatment (r = 0.99 for CEM cells and r = 0.96 for K562 cells). Furthermore, IR spectroscopy is able to detect apoptotic changes in these cells already after 4 h treatment with VP-16, compared to flow cytometry which needs 6 h to observe significant changes.

TSC is associated with mutations in 2 genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. The functions of these proteins have yet to be determined. Recently, the Drosophila homologue of TSC2, gigas, has been shown to be required for the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. However, the mechanism of this action remains unknown. Because the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 forms a complex with cyclin B1 to trigger the G2/M transition, we hypothesized that tuberin interacts with CDK1 to regulate its activity. In the study reported in this paper, we have used co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy to demonstrate that tuberin interacts with and co-localizes with CDK1 and its binding partner cyclin B1 in multiple cell types. We also demonstrate that hamartin interacts with CDK1 and cyclin B1. We further present evidence that tuberin interacts with the other regulatory subunit of CDK1, cyclin A. These findings suggest a direct role for tuberin and hamartin in modulating the activity of CDK1 during G2 and the G2/M transition. This is the first description of a role for both tuberin and hamartin in a common cellular function, providing a potential mechanism for the identical clinicopathologic manifestations that result when either of these proteins are inactivated.","['Catania, M G', 'Mischel, P S', 'Vinters, H V']","['Catania MG', 'Mischel PS', 'Vinters HV']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90095-1732, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,"['0 (CycB protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TSC1 protein, human)', '0 (TSC2 protein, human)', '0 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 Protein)', '0 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin A/*metabolism', 'Cyclin B/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'G2 Phase/physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tuberous Sclerosis/genetics', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 Protein', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/07/11 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/07/11 10:00'],"['2001/07/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnen/60.7.711 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2001 Jul;60(7):711-23. doi: 10.1093/jnen/60.7.711.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: We have previously shown that porphyrin biosynthesis modulators, such as Oph, which is also an iron-chelating agent, enhance protoporphyrin IX (Proto) accumulation in mammalian neoplastic cells treated with delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). As a result of the enhanced Proto accumulation, a significant increase in photodynamic damage was observed under illumination. Also tetrapyrrole and heme-biosynthesis modulators have been shown to cause death in treated insect larvae in darkness, a phenomenon referred to as dark-cell death. Dark-cell death was also observed in Oph + ALA-treated transformed mammalian cells. METHODS: Neoplastic cells were treated with ALA, Oph, and ALA + Oph, and the following cell properties were investigated: growth arrest, membrane permeability, cell survival, nucleosomal cleavage, and cell cycle alterations. RESULTS: It was observed that Oph but not ALA induced growth arrest, in a T-cell leukemia line (MLA 144) as assessed by reduction in DNA synthesis. Exogenous Proto and isomers of Oph lacking the iron-chelating property of Oph also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation in MLA 144 cells. Although the plasma membrane of Oph-treated cells remained intact following 3 h of dark-incubation, the cells exhibited DNA internucleosomal cleavage, characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis using the DNA intercalating dye propidium iodide (PI) coupled to flow cytometry, indicated that 81 +/- 5.6% of Oph-treated MLA 144 cells were apoptotic, with the majority of the cells arrested in the early S phase. On the other hand, treatment with either ALA or Proto did not alter the cell cycle. Also, using a double-labeling protocol with Hoechst 33342, and PI, and analysis by flow cytometry, Oph-treated cells were found to be 82% apoptotic after 3 h of dark-incubation.

Day-100 treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 19%. Poor-prognosis cytogenetics increased the risk of day-100 TRM (hazard ratio 11.4, P = 0.003), and use of tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis reduced the risk of day-100 TRM (hazard ratio 0.13, P = 0.027).

Refractoriness to conventional induction chemotherapy prior to transplantation was an independent risk factor for relapse (hazard ratio 10.8, P = 0.02). Three-year survival was 26% (95% CI, 14%-37%); survival rates were 29% for those transplanted for AML in second remission, 31% transplanted for AML in relapse, and 17% with MDS, and there were no independent risk factors for survival. TBC is an active preparative regimen for advanced AML.

Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood by flow cytometry is not widely recognized as a method for diagnosing HCL, perhaps due to the expectation of low yield of neoplastic cells in patients who are characteristically leukopenic. The abnormal coexpression of CD103, CD25, and intense CD11c and CD20 on monotypic, slightly large B-lymphocytes has previously been shown to be highly characteristic of HCL. We wished to determine if this pattern was valuable in the diagnosis of HCL in leukopenic patients with low levels of neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood. The abnormal immunophenotype above was observed in 25 peripheral blood specimens from patients with unexplained cytopenias or suspected lymphoproliferative processes. Ten of the 25 blood samples exhibited this abnormal phenotype in less than 5% of circulating leukocytes (ranging from <1% to 4%). All 10 patients had other manifestations of HCL, including cytopenias (mean white blood cell count, 1.8 x 10(3)/mm(3); hemoglobin, 11.0 gm/dl; platelets, 74 x 10(3)/mm(3)), splenomegaly, and typical bone marrow morphologic changes. Eight of the 10 patients achieved an excellent response to one course of 2-CDA, with significant improvement of cytopenias (mean white blood cell count: 5.3 x 10(3)/mm(3); hemoglobin: 14.4 g/dl; platelets: 181 x 10(3)/mm(3)) and regression of splenomegaly. One patient had a partial response to alpha interferon and a subsequent complete response to 2-CDA, and one died during treatment. In conclusion, flow cytometric immunophenotyping of peripheral blood is capable of detecting low levels of circulating malignant cells in HCL, even in leukopenic patients. As such, it can be a very useful, non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of this disorder.","['Cornfield, D B', 'Mitchell Nelson, D M', 'Rimsza, L M', 'Moller-Patti, D', 'Braylan, R C']","['Cornfield DB', 'Mitchell Nelson DM', 'Rimsza LM', 'Moller-Patti D', 'Braylan RC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/blood/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.1120 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2001 Aug;67(4):223-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.1120.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacy and toxicity were evaluated in relation to patient age at diagnosis (age < or > or = 36 months). METHODS: Two hundred and one patients treated for high-risk ALL on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 87-01 were included, 147 of whom were in continuous complete disease remission and were eligible for cognitive testing. Sixty-one patients consented to undergo testing. All patients received 18 grays (Gy) of cranial radiation as a component of central nervous system treatment. RESULTS: For all 201 patients, the 5-year overall survival (% +/- the standard error) was 82% +/- 2 and the 5-year event-free survival (% +/- the standard error) was 75% +/- 3. Only two patients developed a central nervous system recurrence. Intelligence quotient (IQ) and memory were at the expected mean for age, but performance on a complex figure drawing task was found to be reduced. Children who were age < 36 months at the time of diagnosis were found to have an IQ in the average range, but showed verbal deficits. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate excellent efficacy of therapy and relatively limited late neurotoxicity on a childhood ALL therapy protocol in which all evaluated patients had received 18 Gy of cranial radiation. Efficacious therapy that includes cranial radiation does not appear to necessarily incur a heightened risk for significant cognitive impairment.","['Waber, D P', 'Shapiro, B L', 'Carpentieri, S C', 'Gelber, R D', 'Zou, G', 'Dufresne, A', 'Romero, I', 'Tarbell, N J', 'Silverman, L B', 'Sallan, S E']","['Waber DP', 'Shapiro BL', 'Carpentieri SC', 'Gelber RD', 'Zou G', 'Dufresne A', 'Romero I', 'Tarbell NJ', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE']","[""Division of Psychology, The Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. deborah.waller@tch.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/radiation effects', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20010701)92:1<15::AID-CNCR1286>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010701)92:1<15::aid-cncr1286>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jul 1;92(1):15-22. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010701)92:1<15::aid-cncr1286>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,"['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-HD18655/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

The authors investigated the effect of daunorubicin in combination with ara-C in patients with refractory or recurring acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-two patients with refractory or recurring AML received escalating doses of daunorubicin of 75, 100, 125, or 135 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days together with ara-C 1 g/m(2) intravenous continuous infusion daily for 4 days. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (29%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and 7 (11%) a hematologic improvement (i.e., met all criteria for CR except for platelet count < 100 x 10(9)/L) for an overall response rate of 40%. The dose-limiting toxicity was mucositis in 4 in 9 (44%) patients treated at the 150 mg/m(2) dose level, but minimal at 125 mg/m(2) (2 of 32, 6%) or 135 mg/m(2) (1 of 13, 8%). Cardiotoxicity Grade 2 was observed in 4 patients (6%) and Grade 3 or higher in 4 patients (6%).

This study was designed to determine whether the rates of consanguinity and family history of cancer among the families of children with lymphoid malignancy are different from those in the general population. METHODS: The study comprised 117 patients from the whole of the country with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), ranging in age from 2 to 14 years. The consanguinity rate in the study group was compared with the rate in the general population. To study family history of cancer, the authors matched patients with 117 controls. In a telephone interview, each mother was asked to provide data regarding the biologic relationship between her and her husband as well as that between both sets of grandparents; each was also asked whether any family relative had a cancer and, if so, of what type. RESULTS: Among the 69 ALL cases, 80% of families were consanguineous and 20% were nonconsanguineous. Among the 26 NHL and 22 HL cases, each group included 3 consanguineous families, 12% and 14%, respectively. The consanguinity rates for ALL, NHL, and HL were all significantly different from the 50.5% consanguinity rate in the UAE population (all three P values < 0.0001). The family history of cancer was more often positive in ALL patients than in controls (odds ratio, 2.14; confidence interval, 1.01--4.53). Overall and for each lymphoid malignancy, there was no difference in family history of cancer between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous groups of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The consanguinity rate in the families of patients with ALL is significantly higher and in those with NHL and HL significantly lower than that in the UAE population. The family history of cancer is more often positive among ALL cases than controls--consanguinity having no effect.","['Bener, A', 'Denic, S', 'Al-Mazrouei, M']","['Bener A', 'Denic S', 'Al-Mazrouei M']","['Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Consanguinity', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'United Arab Emirates/epidemiology']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20010701)92:1<1::AID-CNCR1284>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010701)92:1<1::aid-cncr1284>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jul 1;92(1):1-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010701)92:1<1::aid-cncr1284>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, clinical trial. ANIMALS USED: Ten client-owned domestic shorthair cats. METHODS: Routine biochemical and hematologic evaluation was performed on each cat, and all were tested for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Microbial culture was performed on samples from the wounds. After surgical debridement, omentalization using a vascular pedicle of greater omentum, and closure of the chronic axillary wounds, using a thoracodorsal axial pattern flap, was performed. All excised tissue was examined histologically. RESULTS: The sex distribution was 7 males and 3 females, with a mean age of 3.5 years. The cats had undergone a median number of 3 previous repair attempts over a 1.5- to 25-month period before referral (mean, 10.2 months). No hematologic or biochemical abnormalities were noted apart from moderately elevated creatine kinase and aspartate transaminase concentrations in some cats. All cats were negative for FIV and FeLV. Histologic examination of resected tissue revealed hair (foreign body) in 2 cats and an unidentified foreign-body reaction in 3 other cats. Complete healing occurred in all cats (mean follow-up period of 21.7 months), with 2 cats requiring further surgery: 1 for flap dehiscence at 4 days after surgery, and 1 for donor-site dehiscence at 4 days after surgery. One other cat developed a large seroma in the axilla that resolved by 10 days following surgery. CONCLUSION: The use of an omental pedicle graft in combination with a thoracodorsal axial pattern flap is the first consistently successful 1-step technique for the management of chronic nonhealing axillary wounds in cats.","['Lascelles, B D', 'White, R A']","['Lascelles BD', 'White RA']","[""Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Department of Clinical Veterinary Science, Cambridge, CB3 OES, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Vet Surg,Veterinary surgery : VS,8113214,,IM,"['Animals', 'Axilla', 'Cat Diseases/surgery', 'Cats/*injuries', 'Female', 'Male', 'Omentum/*transplantation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Surgical Flaps/*veterinary', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wounds and Injuries/surgery/*veterinary']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161349901831045 [pii]', '10.1053/jvet.2001.24396 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Surg. 2001 Jul-Aug;30(4):380-5. doi: 10.1053/jvet.2001.24396.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons'],,,,,,,,,,

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal suppression is related to the duration of therapy, type of steroid used and dosage, and schedule of glucocorticoid administration. To evaluate the suppression and recovery time of the HPA axis in children with acute leukemia, we performed the ovine CRH (oCRH) stimulation test in 15 patients, who were given high doses of dexamethasone as part of their induction chemotherapy for 42 days. The oCRH tests were performed before, and 7 and 14 days after, discontinuation of the glucocorticoid. The ACTH levels were not significantly different among the 3 tests. The cortisol levels, however, were significantly (albeit mildly) lower, both basally and after oCRH, 1 and 2 weeks post treatment than before therapy. Six patients had cortisol values that remained suppressed 2 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. One of these patients had manifestations of mild adrenal insufficiency, 6-8 days after discontinuation of therapy, but required no glucocorticoid coverage. We conclude that up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of 6 weeks of high-dose dexamethasone administration, the HPA axis of patients with acute leukemia is mildly suppressed but infrequently associated with clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. This may indicate that major stress, when concurrent with glucocorticoid treatment, may prevent clinically significant adrenal suppression.","['Kuperman, H', 'Damiani, D', 'Chrousos, G P', 'Dichtchekenian, V', 'Manna, T D', 'Filho, V O', 'Setian, N']","['Kuperman H', 'Damiani D', 'Chrousos GP', 'Dichtchekenian V', 'Manna TD', 'Filho VO', 'Setian N']","[""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Children's Hospital, Sao Paulo University School of Medicine-Brazil. hkuperman@terra.com.br""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Glands/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Adrenal Insufficiency/chemically induced', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Hypothalamus/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Infant', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.86.7.7629 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2001 Jul;86(7):2993-6. doi: 10.1210/jcem.86.7.7629.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received pretransplant in vivo T-cell depletion using rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Only one patient had primary graft failure and severe grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease occurred in 14% of the patients. The overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 70% for CMV-negative patients (n = 76) and 29% in the seropositive cohort (n = 49) (P > 0.001). In multivariate analyses, CMV seropositivity remained an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (RR: 2.1; CI: 1.2-3.8; P = 0.014), apart from age > 20 years (RR: 2.74; CI: 1.2-3.8; P = 0.004) and late leucocyte engraftment (RR: 2.4; CI: 1.2-4.9; P = 0.015). The TRM for all patients was 27%. Despite monitoring for CMV antigenaemia and preemptive therapy with ganciclovir when reactivation occurred, seropositive patients had a three times higher risk of fatal treatment-related complications than seronegative patients.

Different amounts of DNA were used as the template for a nested polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the frequency of hybrid Vgamma/Jbeta genes, using silver-stained gels. The frequency of the rearrangement was evaluated in groups before, during and after therapy. A greatly increased frequency of Vgamma/Jbeta trans-rearrangement was found in PBLs of both groups of patients during exposure to chemotherapeutic agents compared with patients before chemotherapy. In patients who had finished treatment, the frequency of the rearrangement fell promptly to the baseline levels in ST but showed a slow decrease in ALL in those in whom increased levels could be found until 4 years after the end of treatment. We hypothesize that the chemotherapeutic agents are able to induce the Vgamma/Jbeta trans-rearrangement, but this is transient in most cases. The exact relationship between the persistence of the rearrangement and the occurrence of secondary leukaemia remains to be determined.","['Lopes, L F', 'Dias Neto, E', 'Lorand-Metze, I', 'Latorre, M R', 'Simpson, A J']","['Lopes LF', 'Dias Neto E', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Latorre MR', 'Simpson AJ']","['Centro de Tratamento e Pesquisa Hospital do Cancer, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Sao Paulo, Brazil. lf.lopes@sti.com.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/genetics', 'Time Factors']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2826 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02826.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jun;113(4):1001-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02826.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have evaluated the roles of different adhesion molecules in normal and leukaemia cell extravasation in a novel organotypic model for vessel wall and measured plasma ICAM-1 and -2 levels in acute leukaemia patients at diagnosis and during chemotherapy. We found that both normal mononuclear cells and blast cells from acute leukaemia patients, as well as retinoic acid-treated promyelocytic leukaemia cells, rapidly extravasated through endothelial cell layers into the underlying collagen matrix. ICAM-1 antibody prevented the extravasation, while antibodies to other adhesion molecules showed little (CD18, ICAM-2) or no inhibition (CD11a and ICAM-3). Soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) protein had no effect. We also observed increased plasma sICAM-1 and -2 levels in leukaemia patients and found that they correlated only weakly with the white blood cell count. No correlation was found between sICAM-1 or -2 levels and the response to therapy. Although elevated sICAM-2 levels decreased rapidly during chemotherapy, sICAM-1 levels did not. Because sICAM-1 protein had no effect on leukaemia cell extravasation in vitro, it is probable that the increased plasma sICAM-1 levels in leukaemia patients may not play a role in leukaemia cell infiltration. However, as we showed that ICAM-1 mediated leukaemia cell extravasation on the cell surface, it is possible that cellular ICAM-1 has an important role in disease progression.","['Mustjoki, S', 'Alitalo, R', 'Elonen, E', 'Carpen, O', 'Gahmberg, C G', 'Vaheri, A']","['Mustjoki S', 'Alitalo R', 'Elonen E', 'Carpen O', 'Gahmberg CG', 'Vaheri A']","['Departments of Virology, University of Helsinki, Finland.

A prospective study was performed to evaluate how far cytogenetically defined prognostic subgroups of AML differ in their proliferative activity as a potential mechanism for differential sensitivities to S-phase-specific induction chemotherapy comprising cytosine arabinoside (AraC). One hundred and eighty-seven patients with de novo AML were included in the study; 25 patients with a favourable [inv(16), t(8;21), t(15;17)] karyotype, 99 with a normal karyotype, 29 with an unfavourable karyotype (-5, 5q-, -7, 7q-, complex aberrations) and 34 with cytogenetic aberrations of unknown prognostic significance (all others). The favourable group demonstrated the highest ex vivo proliferative activity (PA) (3.41 pmol/105 cells), significantly (P = 0.02) exceeding the unfavourable group with the lowest PA (0.72) and the group with a normal karyotype (1.06) or with karyotype of unknown significance (1.05) that both demonstrated an intermediate PA. Samples with a high PA (> median of the whole group) were more likely to produce interleukin 3, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) (56%, 43% and 50%) than cells with a low PA (33%, 36% and 36%; n.s.). The effect of priming by exogenous GM-CSF or G-CSF was significantly more pronounced in samples with a low PA than in rapidly proliferating samples (P < 0.01). For the whole group, a high PA was closely associated with an increased incorporation of AraC triphosphate (AraCTP) into the DNA (P < 0.0001). Clinically, a high PA was associated with a better complete remission (CR) rate in the normal (95% versus 62%) and the unfavourable group (75% versus 33%). The significant differences in proliferative activity between cytogenetic subgroups of AML are associated with increased cytosine arabinoside pharmacodynamics and constitute one potential mechanism for the different response of cytogenetic subgroups to AraC-based induction therapy.","['Braess, J', 'Jahns-Streubel, G', 'Schoch, C', 'Haase, D', 'Haferlach, T', 'Fiegl, M', 'Voss, S', 'Kern, W', 'Schleyer, E', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Braess J', 'Jahns-Streubel G', 'Schoch C', 'Haase D', 'Haferlach T', 'Fiegl M', 'Voss S', 'Kern W', 'Schleyer E', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. jan.braess@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2866 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02866.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jun;113(4):975-82. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02866.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The procedures for the evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2001; 40: 155-65). This synthesis of the literature on chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is based on 129 scientific articles: one meta-analysis, 51 randomised trials, 39 prospective and 18 retrospective studies, and 20 other articles. Altogether, 39,557 patients were included in these studies. The conclusions reached can be summarized into the following points: Standard induction therapy for patients with AML, consisting of daunorubicin and ara-C in conventional doses, results in a complete remission (CR) rate of 50-60% in an unselected population and a long-term survival of about 10-20%. The total doses of both ara-C and daunorubicin are of importance for remission duration and in some studies also for survival. High-dose ara-C in the induction therapy prolongs remission duration in randomised trials, but has not been proven to affect long-term survival. It also increases toxicity and is not generally recommended. Idarubicin, another anthracyclin, has been compared with daunorubicin in conjunction with ara-C, resulting in a higher CR rate, especially in younger patients. In a meta-analysis of the five-randomised trials performed, a slight survival advantage was also seen with idarubicin. Yet, there is inconclusive evidence to conclude that idarubicin is superior to daunorubicin, and further trials are needed. Mitoxantrone improves the outcome of induction therapy in comparison with daunorubicin in some randomised studies, but conclusive evidence is still lacking. The addition of etoposide to daunorubicin or mitoxantrone and ara-C has improved CR rates, but has not convincingly improved survival and secondary leukaemias may be induced. New induction treatment strategies are defined by identification of prognostic subgroups. A risk stratification of AML patients as to chromosomal aberrations might be of importance for the choice of therapy. Moreover, the speed and the morphological response to the first induction course are predictive for relapse. However, no prospective randomised studies are as yet published regarding risk-adapted induction therapy. Post-remission dose-intensive chemotherapy prolongs the duration of remission, seemingly most in patients < 60 years. However, the data in support of these conclusions are sparse. A convincing effect on survival has not been shown. Limited data indicate that post-remission maintenance therapy with long-term attenuated chemotherapy prolongs time to recurrence, without evidence for prolongation of survival. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is an established practice for consolidation in first remission for young patients with an HLA-matched sibling. It is however not known which patients will really benefit from transplantation as no truly randomised comparison of allogeneic vs autologous transplantation or conventionally-dosed chemotherapy has been performed. Patients with and without an HLA-identical sibling have been compared on the basis of intention-to-treat principles ('genetic randomisation'). The disease-free survival seems to be prolonged in the donor group, due to a lower relapse rate with allogeneic transplantation. A higher procedure-related mortality makes the effects on total survival uncertain. Randomised trials with autologous transplantation vs conventional consolidation show a lower relapse rate and a trend for an improved disease-free survival. In one study, in which an autograft was added to four courses of intensive therapy, there was also a late survival advantage. Thus, the role for intensified post-remission treatment in first complete remission with high-dose chemotherapy followed by allogeneic or autologous marrow or stem cell transplantation requires further studies. Moreover, studies with stratification of therapy according to predictors for prognosis in the individual patient are needed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation after minimal or reduced myeloablative conditioning ('mini-transplantation' or non-myelo stem cell transplantation) induces a host-vs-graft tolerance and an immune graft-vs-leukaemia effect. This new concept of immunotherapy seems to have a low procedure-related mortality, but long-term effects are unknown and evaluation in controlled clinical studies is required. Patients with relapsed AML can only infrequently achieve long-term remissions with chemotherapy in conventional doses. trolled data indicate that allogeneic transplantation can be a curative treatment for these patients a","['Kimby, E', 'Nygren, P', 'Glimelius, B']","['Kimby E', 'Nygren P', 'Glimelius B']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/02841860151116321 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2001;40(2-3):231-52. doi: 10.1080/02841860151116321.,,,['SBU-group.

The procedures for the evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2001; 40: 155-65). This synthesis of the literature on chemotherapy for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) is based on data from 20 randomised controlled trials and one meta-analysis. Moreover, data from 19 prospective studies, one retrospective study and four other articles were used. Totally 44 scientific articles are included, involving 11,289 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized into the following points: Primary treatment of patients with symptomatic B-CLL is recommended to be an oral alkylating agent such as chlorambucil. This drug induces tumour remission and symptomatic relief in a majority of patients with progressive disease. Response may be long-lasting, but cure is not obtained. Optimum dose and schedule of administration of chlorambucil or other alkylating agents have not been defined. It is recommended to defer initial therapy until required by disease progression. Large randomised trials have demonstrated that early treatment with chlorambucil in a continuous or an intermittent schedule does not prolong survival in B-CLL patients with low tumour burden (Binet stage A). The addition of corticosteroids to alkylator regimens has not been proven to give any benefit. Combination chemotherapy as primary treatment has not shown any advantage compared with single drugs. Early inclusion of anthracyclines to the therapy does not convincingly add to the activity of alkylating agents. The purine analogues fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine are active in B-CLL. However, like other drugs, they do not appear to be curative. In randomised multicentre trials a benefit from fludarabine as primary therapy compared with polychemotherapy (CHOP or CAP) has been observed in terms of tolerance and treatment response but not yet in survival. No randomised studies have been performed to show whether one of the purine analogues should be preferred. At relapse after single drug treatment, retreatment with the same drug often induces new remissions. However, the proportion of patients responding declines each time chlorambucil or any other single agent is readministered. At progression on single alkylating agents, the purine analogues or various combinations, mostly CHOP, frequently induce tumour remissions. For patients with advanced B-CLL failing to respond to fludarabine or CHOP, the prognosis is poor. None of the salvage regimens reported has produced durable remissions. High-dose chemo-radiotherapy with stem cell transplantation has been evaluated for young patients with B-CLL. A long survival has been shown in some patients following allogeneic and autologous transplantation. However, the risk of transplantation-related mortality is still high with allo-transplants and relapse is common after auto-transplantation. A benefit of purging autologous stem cells has been proposed but evidence is lacking. Thus, transplantation remains experimental; more patients and a longer follow-up are needed to assess if cure can be achieved. In the future an individual risk-adapted therapy will be required. The clinical heterogeneity of the disease has pointed to the necessity of new predictors for prognosis evaluated in prospective trials.","['Kimby, E', 'Brandt, L', 'Nygren, P', 'Glimelius, B']","['Kimby E', 'Brandt L', 'Nygren P', 'Glimelius B']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VAP-cyclo protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/07/10 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/07/10 10:00'],"['2001/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/02841860151116303 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2001;40(2-3):224-30. doi: 10.1080/02841860151116303.,,,['SBU-group.

The report is intended primarily for decision-makers at various levels, both practitioners and administrators. It is also of interest for the medical profession. The extensive body of scientific literature was reviewed according to strict criteria that reflected the scientific weight of the literature. Sixteen experts representing different disciplines (oncology, surgery, internal medicine, health economy and quality of life research) participated in the literature review. Each section was discussed within the project group and was reviewed by at least one, but usually two international researchers. Additional input was provided by national experts representing different scientific disciplines. For the final evaluation to be as close to the objective truth as possible, a concerted effort was made to guarantee objectivity and thorough assessment of current knowledge about the effects of chemotherapy on the selected cancers. The tumour types selected for this assessment include firstly those types where three investigations had shown an increased use of chemotherapy in Sweden during the latest decade. These were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and urinary bladder cancer. Secondly, the two tumour types comprising the greatest number of patients treated with chemotherapy in Sweden, breast cancer and haematological malignancies, were included. Among the haematological malignancies, the most prevalent ones, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the large B-cell type and indolent NHL of follicular type were evaluated. These constitute about 75%, of all haematological malignancies. Thirdly, ovarian cancer was included since chemotherapy has been extensively used and since, at the time of the planning of this overview, a group of very expensive drugs, the taxanes, had preliminarily shown promising results. A wealth of scientific literature has been published on cancer therapy. The review presented in this report is limited to scientific studies judged to be important for evaluating chemotherapy efficacy. Assessments of the content and quality of these studies, and a critical summary of the results in all stages of the selected tumours, have never before been attempted in this way. However, similar comprehensive overviews of certain stages of the tumours have previously been made. These overviews were also critically evaluated. Totally 1,496 studies involving 558,743 patients were reviewed. The survey of practice of chemotherapy use involved all departments of surgery, urology, gynaecology, internal medicine including haematologic units, pulmonary medicine and general and gynaecologic oncology at 16 hospitals in two health care regions in Sweden, covering 39% of the Swedish population. During the 4 weeks of the survey, all patients with the diagnoses concerned who received chemotherapy were registered. The study included 1,590 patients. The working group's general conclusions are summarised in the following points: The literature on the effects of chemotherapy is extensive. Chemotherapy has a well-documented role in the curative and palliative treatment of patients with several types of cancer. The use of chemotherapy is of utmost importance for the possibility of cure in certain tumour types. In other tumours, chemotherapy increases the possibility of cure when added to local and regional treatments, particularly surgery. In the instances of no possibility of cure, chemotherapy may to a variable extent improve both patient survival and well-being. In Sweden chemotherapy is largely used in accordance with that documented in the scientific literature. The extent of both over- and under-treatment seems to be limited but cannot be excluded at the individual patient level. The literature-based knowledge is scientifically of lower quality in the most chemotherapy sensitive tumours than in tumours showing more limited sensitivity. In the more sensitive tumours, positive effects on a symptomatic stage and survival were seen several decades ago. In those days, clinical treatment studies did not fulfil the current high quality requirements. Small life-prolonging effects of chemotherapy are sometimes very well documented in large, high quality scientific studies.

To investigate possible consequences of this genetic alteration for tumor development, we conditionally expressed p16(INK4A) in the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line CCRF-CEM, which carries a homozygous deletion of this gene. In agreement with its reported function, p16(INK4A) expression was associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRB and stable cell cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1), documenting that the pRB/E2F pathway is functional in these cells. Unexpectedly, p16(INK4A) expression increased the sensitivity threshold for glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis from therapeutic to physiologic levels. As a possible explanation for this phenomenon, we found that p16(INK4A)-arrested cells had elevated GC receptor expression associated with enhanced GC-mediated transcriptional activity and increased responsiveness of the GC-regulated cyclin D3 gene. These data are supported by our previous findings that GC receptor levels critically influence GC sensitivity and imply that p16(INK4A) inactivation, in addition to allowing unrestricted proliferation, represents a mechanism by which lymphoid tumor cells might escape cell death triggered by endogenous GC.","['Ausserlechner, M J', 'Obexer, P', 'Wiegers, G J', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R']","['Ausserlechner MJ', 'Obexer P', 'Wiegers GJ', 'Hartmann BL', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck Medical School and the Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of systemically applied vitamin D analogs for treating cancer has not yet fulfilled its promise. A main reason for these disappointing results is that the use of systemically applied vitamin D analogs is limited by severe side effects, mostly hypercalcemia, at the supraphysiological doses needed to reach clinical improvement. New concepts for the development of cancer treatment strategies that are based on the use of vitamin D(3) compounds are discussed in this manuscript. At the moment, different strategies that may enable the application of vitamin D analogs for the treatment of various malignancies, including malignant skin tumors, are employed. It has been shown that certain vitamin D analogs differ in their intracellular metabolism, nongenomic actions, pharmacokinetics, interaction with the vitamin D binding protein (DBP) or the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Several of these new concepts are based on recent laboratory results demonstrating that VDR requires heterodimerisation with additional nuclear cofactors such as the retinoid-X receptor (RXR) for sufficient DNA-binding or are based on new findings in the metabolism of vitamin D. Taken together, these new strategies hold promise that analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) may herald a new era in the treatment of various malignancies, including skin cancer.","['Reichrath, J']",['Reichrath J'],"['Hautklinik der Universitat des Saarlandes, Homburg/Saar.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Calcitriol/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['50299 [pii]', '10.1159/000050299 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2001 Apr;24(2):128-33. doi: 10.1159/000050299.,,,,,50,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

The precise determination of chromosomal changes helps to indicate the prognosis and to understand the pathogenesis of CLL. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We applied conventional cytogenetics (CC), FISH and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to the investigation of clonal abnormalities in 88 B-CLL patients at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: By using CC of bone marrow cells without any stimulation, non-random chromosomal changes were found in 17 (19%) of 88 patients. The employment of FISH and CGH revealed chromosomal changes in additional 33 patients, thus increasing the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities to 57%. The most common abnormalities detected in our patients included deletions of 13q in 16 cases (18%), followed by trisomy of chromosome 12 in 12 patients (13%), deletions of 11q in 10 patients (11%) and deletions of 17p in 10 patients (11%). A statistically significant correlation between higher disease activity and the presence of deletions 11q and 17p was observed. CONCLUSION: The addition of FISH and CGH to CC in 88 B-CLL patients improved the detection of clonal chromosomal changes from 19 to 57%. The most frequent chromosomal change was deletion of 13q14 (18%). Deletions of 11q23 and 17p13 were found in patients with higher clinical disease activity. Our results underline the importance of employing FISH and CGH techniques in CLL patients. CC without any stimulation has a low detection rate and is not suggested for detection of chromosomal changes in CLL.","['Jarosova, M', 'Jedlickova, K', 'Holzerova, M', 'Urbanova, R', 'Papajik, T', 'Raida, L', 'Pikalova, Z', 'Lakoma, I', 'Prekopova, I', 'Kropackova, J', 'Indrak, K']","['Jarosova M', 'Jedlickova K', 'Holzerova M', 'Urbanova R', 'Papajik T', 'Raida L', 'Pikalova Z', 'Lakoma I', 'Prekopova I', 'Kropackova J', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Palacky University Hospital, Olomouc (Czech Republic). marie.jarosova@fnol.cz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['ONK24060 [pii]', '10.1159/000050284 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2001 Feb;24(1):60-5. doi: 10.1159/000050284.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

CD7/CD56 coexpression has been suggested to be a distinct biological and clinical entity of AML. PATIENT: This is a report of a 53-year-old woman who developed CD7/CD56-positive AML with primary manifestation as intracranial tumor. The patient reported of neurological impairment (impairment of visus and occurrence of double pictures). Cranial computed tomography showed an intracranial tumor, and histological examination exhibited myeloid blast cells. Peripheral leukocyte count at admission was within the normal range (5,32 Gpt/l), and percentage frequency of blasts in the blood smears was 54%. Cytological bone marrow examination showed diffuse infiltration by the same myeloid blast cells. The immunophenotype was CD7/CD13/CD33/CD38/CD56/ HLA-DR-positive. The blast cells were myeloperoxidase-positive but lactoferrin-negative. Thus, diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (M2 FAB) was established. Treatment consists of chemotherapy (Ara-C and anthracycline) and local radiation of the intracranial tumor. After treatment patient achieved a complete remission. CONCLUSION: With regard to the literature CD7/CD56-positive AML have a high incidence of central nervous system involvement which should be kept in mind and may be associated to CD56 expression.

Promising results have been reported with new cytotoxic agents such as the purine analogues fludarabine and 2-chlordeoxyadenosine, either at first diagnosis or at relapse. Nevertheless, all patients with CLL relapse after initial response. Since residual lymphoma cells are very likely to be the origin of the clinical relapse, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches with different mechanism of action to eliminate these residual cells. These approaches include allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation as well as immunotherapeutic strategies. Monoclonal antibodies, either alone or conjugated to toxins or radioisotopes, are thus being actively investigated. In clinical trials the genetically engineered chimeric unconjugated anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab and the humanized unconjugated anti-CD52 antibody Campath-1H achieved the most promising results in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus far there is only little clinical experience with Rituximab in patients with CLL, and the exact role of these agent in the treatment of CLL has still to be determined in ongoing and future trials. As a single agent Campath-1H showed more clinical activity in previously treated CLL patients than Rituximab, with response rates of up to 33% in a multicenter pivotal study. Furthermore, the potential risks of tumor lysis and anaphylaxia for both antibodies and immunosuppression particularly for Campath-1H must be taken into account. The present review will compare the development and the basic principles of these unconjugated monoclonal antibodies and consider their present and potential role in the treatment of patients with CLL.

Here we describe the intercellular transfer of OX40L molecules by a non-Ag specific manner. After 2-h coculture of activated CD4(+) T cell (OX40L(-), OX40(+)) with FLAG peptide-tagged OX40L (OX40L-flag) protein-expressing COS-1 cells, the OX40L-flag protein was detected on the cell surface of the CD4(+) T cells by both anti-OX40L and anti-FLAG mAbs. The intercellular OX40L transfer was specifically abrogated by pretreatment of the COS-1 cells with anti-OX40L mAb, 5A8. The OX40L transfer to OX40-negative cells was also observed, indicating an OX40-independent pathway of OX40L transfer. HUVECs, allostimulated monocytes, and human T cell leukemia virus type I-infected T cells, which all express OX40L, can potentially act as the donor cells of OX40L. The entire molecule of OX40L was transferred and stabilized on the recipient cell membrane with discrete punctate formation. The transferred OX40L on normal CD4(+) T cells was functionally active as they stimulated latent HIV-1-infected cells to produce viral proteins via OX40 signaling. Therefore, these findings suggest that the intercellular molecular transfer of functional OX40L may be involved in modifying the immune responses.","['Baba, E', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Lichtenfeld, J', 'Tanaka, R', 'Yoshida, A', 'Sugamura, K', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Tanaka, Y']","['Baba E', 'Takahashi Y', 'Lichtenfeld J', 'Tanaka R', 'Yoshida A', 'Sugamura K', 'Yamamoto N', 'Tanaka Y']","['Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Okinawa-Asia Research Center of Medical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. e-baba@tumor.med.kyushu-u. ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OX40 Ligand)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '98849-88-8 (FLAG peptide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotinylation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Extracellular Space/*immunology/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'OX40 Ligand', 'Oligopeptides', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, OX40', '*Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*metabolism']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.2.875 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Jul 15;167(2):875-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.2.875.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, TL tetramers were prepared with T3(b)-TL and murine beta(2)-microglobulin, not including antigenic peptides, and binding specificity was studied. CTL clones against TL Ags were stained with the T3(b)-TL tetramer, and the binding shown to be CD3 and CD8 dependent. Normal lymphocytes from various origins were also studied. Surprisingly, most CD8(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes derived from the small intestines (iIEL), as well as CD8(+) and CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes, were stained, while only very minor populations of CD8(+) cells derived from other peripheral lymphoid tissues, such as spleen and lymph nodes, were positive. The binding of T3(b)-TL tetramers to CD8(+) iIEL and thymocytes was CD8 dependent, but CD3 independent, in contrast to that to TL-restricted CTL. These results altogether showed that TL-restricted CTL can be monitored by CD3-dependent binding of T3(b)-TL tetramers. In addition, CD3-independent T3(b)-TL tetramer binding to iIEL and thymocytes may imply that TL expressed on intestinal epithelium and cortical thymocytes has a physiological function interacting with these tetramer(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes.","['Tsujimura, K', 'Obata, Y', 'Matsudaira, Y', 'Ozeki, S', 'Yoshikawa, K', 'Saga, S', 'Takahashi, T']","['Tsujimura K', 'Obata Y', 'Matsudaira Y', 'Ozeki S', 'Yoshikawa K', 'Saga S', 'Takahashi T']","['Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan. ktsujimu@aichi-cc.pref.aichi.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/physiology', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology/*metabolism']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.2.759 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Jul 15;167(2):759-64. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.2.759.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantification is based on the coamplification of telomeric repeats synthesized by telomerase along with a specifically designed recombinant DNA-internal standard (DNA-IS). The DNA-IS has a similar size and the same primer recognition sites as the telomerase DNA products and differs from them only in a central 18 bp sequence. PCR products are captured on microtiter wells via the biotin-streptavidin system and hybridized with two distinct digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes that are designed to recognize specifically telomerase products and DNA-IS. The hybrids are quantified by a luminometric reaction using an antidigoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The hybridization assay was validated with the MCF-7 breast carcinoma and leukemia K-562 cell lines and a synthetic telomerase product (R(8)). RESULTS: Luminescence ratios for telomerase products and DNA-IS were linearly related to the concentration of the pre-PCR product synthesized by telomerase (R(8)), in the range of 0.0005 to 10 pM. The overall reproducibility of the assay (between-run) varied between 11.3 and 15%. Application of the method in eleven breast tumors showed a great variation in the levels of telomerase enzymatic activity. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed luminometric hybridization assay for the quantitative determination of telomerase enzymatic activity is highly sensitive and can be used for a large-scale prospective evaluation of clinical samples.","['Kolioliou, M', 'Talieri, M', 'Lianidou, E S']","['Kolioliou M', 'Talieri M', 'Lianidou ES']","['Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, 15771, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Calibration', 'Chemistry, Clinical/*methods', 'DNA, Recombinant/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Telomerase/*blood/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-9120(01)00225-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-9120(01)00225-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2001 Jun;34(4):277-84. doi: 10.1016/s0009-9120(01)00225-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Likewise, retinoic acid treatment blocked Ca(2+) influx activated by store depletion via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

These data suggest that store-operated Ca(2+) influx changed during cell-cycle progression which might have important implications for cell growth.","['Bodding, M']",['Bodding M'],"['University Laboratory of Physiology, Parks Road, Oxford, UK. matthias.boedding@med-rz.uni-sb.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Potassium/pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/ceca.2001.0222 [doi]', 'S0143-4160(01)90222-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 2001 Aug;30(2):141-50. doi: 10.1054/ceca.2001.0222.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,['Cell Calcium 2001 Sep;30(3):228'],,

Ca(2+) release and subsequent Ni(2+)-sensitive, store-operated influx were induced by thapsigargin and stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. The alleged noncompetitive IP3 receptor inhibitor,2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) rapidly blocked a major part of the secondary influx response in CHO cells in a reversible manner. It also reduced Mn(2+) influx in response to thapsigargin. Inhibition of Ca(2+) release was also seen but this was less complete, slower in onset, less reversible, and required higher concentration of 2-APB. In RBL-1 cells, I(CRAC) activity was rapidly blocked by extracellular 2-APB whereas intracellular 2-APB was less effective. Store-operated Ca(2+) influxes were only partially blocked by 2-APB. In SH-SY5Y cells, Ca(2+) influxes were insensitive to 2-APB. Ca(2+) release in RBL-1 cells was partially sensitive but in SH-SY5Y cells the release was totally resistant to 2-APB. The results suggest, that 2-APB (1) may inhibit distinct subtypes of IP3 receptors with different sensitivity, and (2) that independently of this, it also inhibits some store-operated Ca(2+) channels via a direct, extracellular action.","['Kukkonen, J P', 'Lund, P E', 'Akerman, K E']","['Kukkonen JP', 'Lund PE', 'Akerman KE']","['Department of Physiology, Division of Cell Physiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. jkukkone@fysiologi.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'E4ES684O93 (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Boron Compounds/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Fura-2/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/ceca.2001.0219 [doi]', 'S0143-4160(01)90219-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 2001 Aug;30(2):117-29. doi: 10.1054/ceca.2001.0219.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,

Archival bone-marrow smears present a valuable resource that can be exploited easily for mutational analysis. Here, a modified technique to extract DNA is described, and used subsequently for mutation/polymorphism screening of the stem-cell factor receptor proto-oncogene c-kit in 23 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The selected method was straightforward and used bone-marrow material scraped from periodic acid-Schiff, sudan black B and May-Grunwald/Giemsa-stained preparations, and treated initially with proteinase K prepared in digestion buffer to digest all proteinaceous matter. Following incubation, saturated sodium chloride was added and DNA extracted from the supernatant by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol treatment. Retrieved DNA was precipitated with ethanol at -20 degrees C overnight, washed with 95% ethanol, air-dried, resuspended using purite water and stored at -20 degrees C prior to use in mutational analysis. The extraction method described was compared with a commercial reagent for combined DNA, RNA and protein isolation using cryopreserved cells from 20 patients with AML. The quality of extracted DNA isolated by the two methods was comparable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) techniques. Bone-marrow biopsies are performed regularly on each AML patient to monitor the disease; therefore, an extraction method using this resource could liberate a valuable source of DNA for study (e.g. molecular investigations, including mutation/polymorphism screening etc.). This would allow fresh and programme-frozen cells to be reserved for those investigations requiring intact, viable cells. The use of archived bone-marrow smears would permit vast increase in the scope for retrospective testing and large-scale analyses.","['Court, E L', 'Davidson, K', 'Smith, M A', 'Inman, L', 'Marriott, S A', 'Smith, J G', 'Pallister, C J']","['Court EL', 'Davidson K', 'Smith MA', 'Inman L', 'Marriott SA', 'Smith JG', 'Pallister CJ']","['Centre for Research in Biomedicine, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics']",2001/07/07 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 2001;58(2):76-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes a rural hospital consortium as a single Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) affiliate that used local cancer teams and itinerant oncologists to develop a clinical trials program. METHOD: Grafted onto an existing oncology outreach program, educational programs were developed to help identify patients and recruit them to cooperative group clinical trials. Outcomes included the number of patients accrued to clinical trials, and a comparison of the quality of audited research records with those of affiliated institutions of the CALGB. The consequences of the program were to measure changes in patterns of care of breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers during the study period. These included diagnostic, staging, and treatment changes that occurred over time. RESULTS: 3.3% of incident cases were accrued to clinical trials during the study period, more often for breast and colorectal than for lung and prostate cancers. Reasons that were identified for low accrual were lack of clinical trials for the majority of cases, including the elderly. More than 65% of the patients in the outreach population were older than 65, compared with 50% at the cancer center.

Such boosting of this fundamental immune cell population suggests a prophylactic role for this herb in normal animals. Based on this evidence, our goal in the present work was to assess the role of dietary administration of this herbal extract to mice bearing leukemia, a type of tumor well known to be a target for NK cells. DESIGN: A commercially available root extract of E. purpurea, which we have already shown to be highly effective in mice, was administered daily for 50 days from the onset of leukemia (day 0). Control leukemic mice received no extract. Other leukemic mice received the NK-enhancing neurohormone, melatonin, administered precisely as above. In all treatment and control categories, some mice were sampled at 9 days after tumor onset, others were sampled at 3 months, and still others were left to assess treatment effect on life span. RESULTS: At 9 days (intermediate stage leukemia; death beginning by day 17-18), E. purpurea-treated mice had a 2.5-fold increase in the absolute numbers of NK cells in their spleens. By 3 months after leukemia onset, E. purpurea-treated mice still had 2-3 times the normal numbers of NK cells in their spleens. No leukemic, untreated (control) mice remained alive at 3 months, hence the comparison with normal animals. Moreover, at 3 months post-tumor onset, all the major hemopoietic and immune cell lineages in their bone marrow birth site, were recorded at normal numbers, in E. purpurea-consuming, leukemic mice. The survival advantage provided by administering these leukemic mice with E. purpurea was highly significant versus untreated, leukemic mice when analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival statistics. CONCLUSION: The present study has provided the first systematic analysis, under controlled laboratory conditions, of the effect(s) of the botanical, E. purpurea, in vivo, in leukemic hosts. The profoundly positive effects of this herb in disease abatement observed in this study suggest the therapeutic potential of E. purpurea, at least with respect to leukemia, if not other tumors as well.","['Currier, N L', 'Miller, S C']","['Currier NL', 'Miller SC']","['Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Altern Complement Med,"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",9508124,['JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Echinacea/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Melatonin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2001/07/07 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/07 10:00'],"['2001/07/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/107555301300328115 [doi]'],ppublish,J Altern Complement Med. 2001 Jun;7(3):241-51. doi: 10.1089/107555301300328115.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Iowa and Minnesota to evaluate the association between various occupations, industries, and occupational exposures and leukemia risk. A total of 513 cases and 1,087 controls was included in the study. A lifetime occupational history and other risk factor information were collected through in-person interviews, and a job-exposure matrix was used to assess possible risks associated with specific exposures. RESULTS: A significantly increased risk of leukemia was observed among agricultural service industries and among nursing and healthcare workers. Janitors, cleaners, and light truck drivers also experienced increased risk. Those employed in plumbing, heating and air conditioning industries, and sales of nondurable goods (such as paints and varnishes) had an increased risk. Printers, painters, and workers in the food and metal industries had a nonsignificantly increased risk of leukemia. Analyses by specific exposures and histology of leukemia showed that risk of leukemia associated with occupational or industrial exposures may vary by histological type of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of leukemia among workers employed in agricultural industries, nursing and healthcare workers, and in a few occupations with possible exposure to solvents is consistent with earlier studies.

To determine the mechanism(s) of tal-1-induced leukemogenesis, we created transgenic mice expressing a DNA binding mutant of tal-1.

However, wild type tal-1 and the DNA binding mutant both form stable complexes with E2A proteins. In addition, tal-1 stimulates differentiation of CD8-single positive thymocytes but inhibits the development of CD4-single positive cells: effects also observed in E2A-deficient mice.

Evidence suggests that PcG complexes are heterogeneous with respect to both protein composition and specific function. MPc3 is a recently described mouse Polycomb (Pc) protein that shares structural homology with at least two other Pc proteins, M33 and MPc2. All three Pc proteins bind another PcG protein, RING1, through a conserved carboxy-terminal C-box motif. Here, data are presented demonstrating that MPc3 also interacts with AF9, a transcriptional activator implicated in the development of acute leukemias. The carboxy-terminus of AF9 is fused to the MLL protein in leukemias characterized by t(9;11)(p22;q23) chromosomal translocations. Importantly, it is the carboxy-terminus of AF9 to which MPc3 binds. The AF9 binding site of MPc3 maps to a central, non-conserved, region of the polypeptide sequence. In contrast to MPc3, data indicate that the Pc protein M33 does not interact with AF9. This finding suggests a potentially unique role for MPc3 in linking a PcG silencing complex to a transcriptional activator protein.","['Hemenway, C S', 'de Erkenez, A C', 'Gould, G C']","['Hemenway CS', 'de Erkenez AC', 'Gould GC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, LA 70112, USA. chemenw@tulane.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Cbx8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RING1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ring1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2001/07/06 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/06 10:00'],"['2000/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2001/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2001/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204478 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jun 28;20(29):3798-805. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204478.,,,,['1K01 CA78318-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that indirubins are potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3. We here investigated the anti-mitotic properties of this class of compounds using the cell permeable indirubin-3'-monoxime and the HBL-100 cell line. Indirubin-3'-monoxime reversibly arrests asynchronous HBL-100 cells in G2. This arrest is not accompanied by any significant change in expression of the major cell cycle regulators. However indirubin-3'-monoxime inhibits the phosphorylation of consensus CDK phosphorylation sites as well as of nucleolin at a specific CDK1/cyclin B phosphorylation site, suggesting a direct action on the mitotic CDK1/cyclin B. When indirubin-3'-monoxime is added to HBL-100 cells synchronized in M phase by nocodazole, cells undergo an endoreplication leading to an 8n DNA content. As soon as indirubin-3'-monoxime is washed away, these polyploid cells become aneuploid and later die from necrosis.

The loss of heterozygosity at the TEL locus in leukemias and the hemizygous deletion of TEL that is observed in various tumors, suggests that TEL is a tumor suppressor. Overexpression of TEL alters cellular morphology and represses the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin-1. Based on these studies, deletion analysis was used to define the minimal repression domains of TEL. TEL-mediated repression required both the N-terminal pointed domain and a central region composed of amino acids 268-303. The mSin3A and N-CoR corepressors bind to the pointed domain and the central repression domain of TEL, respectively. Unexpectedly, histone deacetylase-3, but not other histone deacetylases, also associates with the central region of TEL. Histone deacetylase-3 interacts with a TEL mutant that cannot bind N-CoR, suggesting that this is a direct interaction with TEL. In addition, histone H3 was under-acetylated near the TEL-binding sites in the endogenous stromelysin-1 promoter when TEL was expressed. Furthermore, trichostatin A, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, impaired TEL-dependent repression of the stromelysin-1 promoter. Finally, while TEL-expression induced cellular aggregation of Ras-transformed cells, Trichostatin A reversed the TEL-induced cellular aggregation phenotype. Thus, the cumulative data suggests that histone deacetylase-3 activity is required for the transcriptional functions of TEL.","['Wang, L', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Wang L', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry and the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Ncor1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/07/06 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/06 10:00'],"['2001/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2001/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204479 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jun 21;20(28):3716-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204479.,,,,"['CA68465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA77274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Epo is required for erythropoiesis in general, glucocorticoids and SCF mainly contribute to stress erythropoiesis in hypoxic mice. This ability of normal erythroid progenitors to undergo expansion under stress conditions is targeted by the avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV), harboring the oncogenes v-ErbB and v-ErbA. We investigated the signaling pathways required for progenitor expansion under stress conditions and in leukemic transformation. Immortal strains of erythroid progenitors, able to undergo normal, terminal differentiation under appropriate conditions, were established from fetal livers of p53-/- mice. Expression and activation of the EGF-receptor (HER-1/c-ErbB) or its mutated oncogenic version (v-ErbB) in these cells abrogated the requirement for Epo and SCF in expansion of these progenitors and blocked terminal differentiation. Upon inhibition of ErbB function, differentiation into erythrocytes occurred. Signal transducing molecules important for renewal induction, i.e. Stat5- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), are utilized by both EpoR/c-Kit and v/c-ErbB.

Unfortunately, GVL reactivity is often associated with life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Here, we describe TCR gamma delta (V gamma 9/V delta 1) CTL, isolated from the peripheral blood of an AML patient after stem cell transplantation (SCT), that very efficiently lysed freshly isolated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and AML cell lines. Interestingly, HLA-matched non-malignant hematopoietic cells were not killed. We revealed that the killer cell-inhibitory receptor (KIR) p58.2 (CD158b) specific for group 2 HLA-C molecules negatively regulates the cytotoxic effector function displayed by these TCR gamma delta CTL. First, an antibody against HLA-C enhances lysis of non-malignant cells. Secondly, stable transfection of HLA-Cw*0304 into the class I-negative cell line 721.221 inhibited lysis. Finally, engagement of p58.2 by antibodies immobilized on Fc gamma R-expressing murine P815 cells inhibits CD3- and TCR gamma delta-directed lysis. Compared to non-malignant hematopoietic cells, AML cells express much lower levels of MHC class I molecules making them susceptible to lysis by p58.2(+) TCR gamma delta CTL. Such KIR-regulated CTL reactivity may have a role in the GVL response without affecting normal tissues of the host and leading to GVHD.","['Dolstra, H', 'Fredrix, H', 'van der Meer, A', 'de Witte, T', 'Figdor, C', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade, E']","['Dolstra H', 'Fredrix H', 'van der Meer A', 'de Witte T', 'Figdor C', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade E']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (KIR2DL3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'HLA-C Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2001/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703043 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 May;27(10):1087-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703043.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although initial treatment with corticosteroids is effective in the majority of patients, 30--60% develop steroid resistance. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is commonly used as first-line therapy for steroid resistant (SR) aGVHD. However, data on its efficacy are limited. At two institutions we reviewed the results of treatment with ATG of 58 patients with SR aGVHD. Initial manifestations of aGVHD were treated with 2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone (MP). Equine ATG was administered as first-line therapy for SR aGVHD, a median of 9 days (range, 3 to 39) after initiation of MP. At the time of initiation of ATG, IBMTR severity indices B, C and D were observed in 6%, 40% and 54% of patients, respectively. Improvement was observed in 30% of patients treated with ATG. Skin disease was more likely to improve with ATG (79%), while progression of gut and liver aGVHD was observed in 40% and 66% of patients, respectively. Despite initial improvement, 52 patients (90%) died a median of 40 days after ATG therapy from progressive aGVHD and/or infection (74%), ARDS (15%), or relapse (11%).

From 1989, we attempted to improve tumor control by using high-dose anthracyclines in induction, by increasing from one to two the number of consolidation courses pre-transplant and by introducing intermediate doses of cytarabine in the first consolidation course. The CR rate was 77% (33/43) before 1989 and 90% (59/65) after 1989 (P = 0.06). Forty-five out of the 59 patients (76%) who achieved CR after 1989 could undergo bone marrow grafting in CR1 vs 16/33 (48%) before 1989 (P = 0.01). In spite of the higher proportion of patients above 50 years after 1989 (32%) toxicity was mild and an adequate graft was obtained more frequently after one collection. The principal factor relating to improvement in graft feasibility was the post-1989 modification of induction and consolidation regimens. This improvement in graft feasibility was associated with a better disease-free survival (DFS) (48 +/- 7% vs 32 +/- 8%, P = 0.04) and overall survival (OS) (53 +/- 6% vs 30 +/- 7%, P = 0.007) at 5 years. By multivariate analysis four factors were associated with overall survival (OS): karyotype, white blood cell count at diagnosis, treatment regimen and bone marrow grafting in CR1.

Here we describe the spatial and temporal regulation of LIF signaling in vivo by using tissues isolated from uteri on different days over the implantation period. During this time, LIF receptors are expressed predominantly in the luminal epithelium (LE) of the uterus. Isolated epithelium responds to LIF by phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3, but not by an increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase levels. The related cytokines Il-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, as well as epidermal growth factor, do not activate Stat3, although epidermal growth factor stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase. In vivo Stat3 activation is induced by LIF alone, resulting in the localization of Stat3 specifically to the nuclei of the LE coinciding with the onset of uterine receptivity. The responsiveness of the LE to LIF is regulated temporally, with Stat activation being restricted to day 4 of pregnancy despite the presence of constant levels of LIF receptor throughout the preimplantation period. Uterine receptivity is therefore under dual control and is regulated by both the onset of LIF expression in the endometrial glands and the release from inhibition of receptor function in the LE.","['Cheng, J G', 'Chen, J R', 'Hernandez, L', 'Alvord, W G', 'Stewart, C L']","['Cheng JG', 'Chen JR', 'Hernandez L', 'Alvord WG', 'Stewart CL']","['Cancer and Developmental Biology Laboratory, Division of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Uterus/*metabolism/pathology']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.151180898 [doi]', '151180898 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jul 17;98(15):8680-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.151180898.

It maps to chromosome 9q34 centromeric to ABL. The gene fusion results from a complex chromosome rearrangement that was resolved by fluorescence in situ hybridization with various probes on chromosomes 9 and 11 as an ins(11;9)(q23;q34)inv(11)(q13q23). The rearrangement resulted in a 5'-MLL/FBP17-3' fusion mRNA. We retrovirally transduced murine-myeloid progenitor cells with MLL/FBP17 to test its transforming ability. In contrast to MLL/ENL, MLL/ELL and other MLL-fusion genes, MLL/FBP17 did not give a positive readout in a serial replating assay. Therefore, we assume that additional cooperating genetic abnormalities might be needed to establish a full malignant phenotype. FBP17 consists of a C-terminal Src homology 3 domain and an N-terminal region that is homologous to the cell division cycle protein, cdc15, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Both domains are separated by a consensus Rho-binding motif that has been identified in different Rho-interaction partners such as Rhotekin and Rhophilin. We evaluated whether FBP17 and members of the Rho family interact in vivo with a yeast two-hybrid assay. None of the various Rho proteins tested, however, interacted with FBP17. We screened a human kidney library and identified a sorting nexin, SNX2, as a protein interaction partner of FBP17.

The secreted form stimulates cell growth and transformation, while the nuclear form inhibits DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. By using the yeast two-hybrid system we have identified a nucleolar FGF3 binding protein (NoBP) which coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with FGF3 in transfected COS-1 cells. Characterization of the NoBP binding domain of FGF3 exactly matched the sequence requirements of FGF3 for its translocation into the nucleoli, suggesting that NoBP might be the nucleolar binding partner of FGF3 essential for its nucleolus localization. Carboxyl-terminal domains of NoBP contain linear nuclear and nucleolar targeting motifs which are capable of directing a heterologous protein beta-galactosidase to the nucleus and the nucleoli. While NoBP expression was detected in all analyzed proliferating established cell lines, NoBP transcription was rapidly downregulated in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 when induced to differentiate. Analysis on the expression pattern of NoBP mRNA throughout the cell cycle in HeLa cells synchronized by lovastatin demonstrated a substantial upregulation during the late G(1)/early S phase. NoBP overexpression conferred a proliferating effect onto NIH 3T3 cells and can counteract the inhibitory effect of nuclear FGF3, suggesting a role of NoBP in controlling proliferation in cells.

Whereas treatment of the human leukemia cell line HL60 with RA results in cellular differentiation, addition of the synthetic retinoid, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (HPR), induces HL60 cells to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment of HL60 cells as well as other cell lines (i.e. NIH3T3 cells) with RA blocks HPR-induced cell death. In attempting to discover the underlying biochemical activities that might account for these cellular effects, we found that monodansylcadaverine (MDC), which binds to the enzyme (transamidase) active site of tissue transglutaminase (TGase), eliminated RA protection against cell death and in fact caused RA to become an apoptotic factor, suggesting that the ability of RA to protect against apoptosis is linked to the expression of active TGase. Furthermore, it was determined that expression of exogenous TGase in cells exhibited enhanced GTP binding and transamidation activities and mimicked the survival advantage imparted by RA. We tested whether the ability of this dual function enzyme to limit HPR-mediated apoptosis was a result of the ability of TGase to bind GTP and/or catalyze transamidation and found that GTP binding was sufficient for the protective effect. Moreover, excessive transamidation activity did not appear to be detrimental to cell viability. These findings, taken together with observations that the TGase is frequently up-regulated by environmental stresses, suggest that TGase may function to ensure cell survival under conditions of differentiation and cell stress.","['Antonyak, M A', 'Singh, U S', 'Lee, D A', 'Boehm, J E', 'Combs, C', 'Zgola, M M', 'Page, R L', 'Cerione, R A']","['Antonyak MA', 'Singh US', 'Lee DA', 'Boehm JE', 'Combs C', 'Zgola MM', 'Page RL', 'Cerione RA']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Photoaffinity Labels)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'I9N81SC5HD (monodansylcadaverine)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cadaverine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fenretinide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Photoaffinity Labels/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Time Factors', 'Transglutaminases/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M105318200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)34751-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Sep 7;276(36):33582-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M105318200.

The ability of SML and SMIL to potentiate the effect of anti-MY9 immunotoxin (anti-MY9-IT) was tested against human leukemia HL-60 sensitive and resistant tumor cells in vitro. SML and SMIL potentiated the activity of anti-MY9-IT by 10-20 times against HL-60 sensitive tumor cell lines. However, greater potentiation of anti-MY9-IT was observed in combination with SML and SMIL against HL-60 resistant tumor cells, found to be 200 and 500 times, respectively. The potentiation of anti-MY9-IT by SMIL was more than two-fold compared with SML against both HL-60 sensitive and resistant tumor cells.

Our studies show that SML and SMIL can be successfully used to potentiate the activity of ricin based anti-MY9-IT in vitro, and further in vivo studies will demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.","['Singh, M', 'Ferdous, A J', 'Kanikkannan, N', 'Faulkner, G']","['Singh M', 'Ferdous AJ', 'Kanikkannan N', 'Faulkner G']","['College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL 32307-3800, USA. mandip.sachdeva@famu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Biopharm,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,9109778,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Monensin/*administration & dosage', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0939641101001424 [pii]', '10.1016/s0939-6411(01)00142-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 2001 Jul;52(1):13-20. doi: 10.1016/s0939-6411(01)00142-4.,,,,"['G12 RR03020-11/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'GM08111-24/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To describe better and compare the survival after randomization of patients from the CLL90 trial that randomly compared ChOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, oncovin, prednisone), CAP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) and fludarabine in advanced CLL, we performed a quality-adjusted survival analysis. This consisted of defining four clinical states (toxicity, treatment free of toxicity, no treatment nor symptoms, relapse), then summing up the average times spent in each state weighted by utility coefficients that reflect relative value according to quality of life. The resulting quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWIST) was compared between randomized groups, and sensitivity (threshold) analyses to the choice of utility coefficients was performed. Over 73 months after randomization, the fludarabine group gained a mean of 45 days of toxicity-free survival at CAP, and 61 days over ChOP. The mean TWIST was 27.05 months with CAP, 31.5 months with ChOP and 32.95 months with fludarabine. The threshold analyses showed that, whatever the utility weights, the mean Q-TWIST was always greater with ChOP or fludarabine as compared to CAP. Fludarabine was consistently a better treatment than ChOP, except in the unlikely case of high utility weights attributed to toxicity and low utility weights attributed to treatment. Nevertheless, from a clinical point of view, differences between ChOP and fludarabine were moderate or event slight (mean difference in TWIST of 1.45 months). We conclude that patients with advanced CLL have a moderate benefit in terms of Q-TWIST when treated with fludarabine over ChOP. These two treatments are always superior to CAP.","['Levy, V', 'Porcher, R', 'Delabarre, F', 'Leporrier, M', 'Cazin, B', 'Chevret, S']","['Levy V', 'Porcher R', 'Delabarre F', 'Leporrier M', 'Cazin B', 'Chevret S']","['Departement de Biostatistique et Informatique Medicale, Hopital Saint Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Epidemiol,Journal of clinical epidemiology,8801383,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ACP protocol', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0895-4356(00)00359-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0895-4356(00)00359-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Epidemiol. 2001 Jul;54(7):747-54. doi: 10.1016/s0895-4356(00)00359-0.,,,['French Cooperative CLL Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Basic research study. SETTING: Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) program at an academic institution. PATIENT(S): Consenting oocyte and sperm donors. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Oocytes were aspirated from oocyte donors (n = 12) and inseminated with frozen-thawed donor (n = 2) sperm followed by culture of embryos to day 5 or 6 in sequential media. The inner cell masses of expanded blastocysts were isolated using immunosurgery and cultured for 4-11 days on irradiated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEFs). Viable cell colonies were passed every 7-10 days onto fresh PMEFs in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (0.1 microg/mL) and evaluated for appropriate cell surface markers. RESULT(S): Immunosurgery of 40 blastocysts resulted in the culture of 18 inner cell masses, which have produced three cell lines. One of these cell lines has been shown to stain positive for alkaline phosphatase and stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4 and negative for SSEA-1, express telomerase activity, and produce hCG when allowed to differentiate. CONCLUSION(S): These findings demonstrate that the future production of human embryonic stem cell lines for therapeutic use is possible with the use of donated gametes. Many ethical issues were considered before the initiation of this study, and it was our goal to ensure that both oocyte and sperm donors understood the nature and purpose of the research before their participating in the study.","['Lanzendorf, S E', 'Boyd, C A', 'Wright, D L', 'Muasher, S', 'Oehninger, S', 'Hodgen, G D']","['Lanzendorf SE', 'Boyd CA', 'Wright DL', 'Muasher S', 'Oehninger S', 'Hodgen GD']","['Technology Development Center, Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia 23507, USA. lanzense@evms.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens)', '0 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Blastocyst/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', '*Cell Line/metabolism', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Female', 'Glycosphingolipids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Male', '*Oocyte Donation', '*Oocytes', '*Spermatozoa', 'Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Telomerase/metabolism', '*Tissue Donors']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0015-0282(01)01825-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(01)01825-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2001 Jul;76(1):132-7. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(01)01825-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying acquired RA resistance in APL patients are not well understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recently established a spontaneous RA-resistant APL cell line (UF-1) from a patient and used this cell line as an excellent in vitro model for RA-resistant clinical situations. We investigated the structural and functional abnormalities of chimeric PML/RARalpha gene in UF-1 cells and preserved materials from the original patient. RESULTS: A novel point mutation was detected in the ligand-binding (E) domain of the RARalpha portion of the PML/RARalpha gene in UF-1 cells. This mutation resulted in amino acid substitution of Arg611 (CGG) for Trp611 (TGG) in the short-form PML/RARalpha protein, which corresponded to Arg276 in wild-type RARalpha. Importantly, the same mutation was also detected in the preserved materials from the original patient. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding wild-type and mutant PML/RARalpha constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and performed RA-binding assay. Interestingly, RA-binding activity was dramatically decreased in the mutant PML/RARalpha compared with that of the wild-type chimeric protein, suggesting that this single amino acid substitution is critical for RA binding. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that a novel point mutation in the ligand-binding domain of the RARalpha portion (Arg611) of the chimeric PML/RARalpha gene decreased sensitivity to all-trans RA. We conclude that acquisition of the PML/RARalpha mutation is one possible mechanism for development of RA resistance in patients with APL in vivo.","['Takayama, N', 'Kizaki, M', 'Hida, T', 'Kinjo, K', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Takayama N', 'Kizaki M', 'Hida T', 'Kinjo K', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00651-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00651-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Jul;29(7):864-72. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00651-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cooperative activation between Hoxa9 and Meis1 is induced by retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias and the myeloid leukemia cell line M1. The present study was conducted to examine possible Meis gene activation and cooperative DNA binding of homeobox proteins in WEHI-3B and to reveal the specific role of Hox and Meis genes in myeloid differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed to examine homeobox genes expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to evaluate DNA binding of homeobox proteins. Myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 was induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. RESULTS: Meis2 was coactivated with Hoxb8 in WEHI-3B cells. DNA-protein complexes including Hox, Meis, and Pbx were observed in WEHI-3B and 32Dcl3. Expression and the DNA-binding complex of Hoxa9, Hoxb8, Meis1, and Meis2 were down-regulated during myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells. Enforced expression of Hox or Meis genes inhibited myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that Meis2 is an important Meis gene for myeloid leukemogenesis and that Hox and Meis are important genes for myeloid leukemogenesis through differentiation block.","['Fujino, T', 'Yamazaki, Y', 'Largaespada, D A', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Nakamura, T']","['Fujino T', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Largaespada DA', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Hirokawa K', 'Nakamura T']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mrg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukopoiesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00655-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00655-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Jul;29(7):856-63. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00655-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 10% of cases are due to adverse drug reactions with roughly another 10% due to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), predominantly mycosis fungoides, or leukemia. It is clear from multiple studies that the clinical diagnosis of the underlying entity is often difficult, as these diseases can present in a very similar fashion. A skin biopsy is usually employed in this setting as a diagnostic tool. However, the histopathologic diagnosis of the underlying cause is complicated by the subtlety of the distinguishing histologic features. In this situation, an ancillary technique demonstrating the presence of a monoclonal T-cell proliferation could help to rule in or out CTCL in cases that clinically and histopathologically do not allow a definitive diagnosis. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 25 biopsies from sixteen patients who presented to the Stanford Dermatology Clinic with erythroderma. We examined the specimens morphologically and analyzed the gamma chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR- gamma) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by heteroduplex analysis for clonality. We then correlated the results of our PCR and heteroduplex analyses with the patients' clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Four biopsies, from three patients, contained clonal TCR-gamma rearrangements; the four biopsies, all of which were equivocal histologically, correlated to diagnoses of mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sezary syndrome (SS). Twenty-one biopsies contained polyclonal T-cell populations. Eighteen of these biopsies represent patients with inflammatory dermatoses. Three of these biopsies, all of which were taken from a single patient, correlate to a diagnosis of MF. CONCLUSION: TCR-gamma PCR heteroduplex analysis seems to represent an important adjuvant diagnostic tool that, used in conjunction with histopathology and clinical history, could help to clarify the underlying etiology of erythroderma.","['Cherny, S', 'Mraz, S', 'Su, L', 'Harvell, J', 'Kohler, S']","['Cherny S', 'Mraz S', 'Su L', 'Harvell J', 'Kohler S']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/*pathology']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['cup280703 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0560.2001.280703.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2001 Aug;28(7):351-5. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0560.2001.280703.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are limited clinical data to support the use of cytokines in prevention and treatment of SM. Thus, at present no adjunctive treatment is justified for routine use in all patients. Potential application of these immunomodulatory agents include the use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the management of mycoses in neutropenic patients with myelogenous leukaemia or bone marrow transplantation. Interferon-gamma may have a useful role against aspergillosis in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.

The challenge for the next decade will be how to select patients for particular molecularly targeted therapeutics and how to combine these agents.","['Frankel, A E', 'Schuster, M W', 'Jurcic, J G']","['Frankel AE', 'Schuster MW', 'Jurcic JG']","['Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['150105 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-200115010-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2001;15(1):55-71. doi: 10.2165/00063030-200115010-00005.,,,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extracellular region of the membrane-bound human CD23 is processed into at least four soluble (s) CD23 forms, with apparent molecular masses of 37, 33, 29, and 25 kDa. High levels of sCD23 are found in patients with allergy, certain autoimmune diseases, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Therefore, inhibition of the processing of membrane-bound CD23 to control the cytokine-like effects of sCD23 offers a novel therapeutic opportunity. While the 37-, 29-, and 25-kDa forms of sCD23 have been expressed previously as recombinant proteins, the 33-kDa form has not been purified and characterized. To further investigate the multiple roles of sCD23 fragments and to devise assays to identify potent small-molecule inhibitors of CD23 processing, we have produced the 33-kDa form of sCD23 using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Drosophila S2 cells. The CHO-expressed 33-kDa protein was found to undergo proteolytic degradation during cell growth and during storage of purified protein, resulting in accumulation of a 25-kDa form. The Drosophila system expressed the 33-kDa sCD23 in a stable form that was purified and demonstrated to be more active than the CHO-derived 25-kDa form in a monocyte TNFalpha release assay.","['Khandekar, S S', 'Mayer, R J', 'Cusimano, D M', 'Katchur, S R', 'Appelbaum, E R']","['Khandekar SS', 'Mayer RJ', 'Cusimano DM', 'Katchur SR', 'Appelbaum ER']","['Department of Protein Biochemistry, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Drosophila/cytology/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis/*genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2001/07/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/prep.2001.1448 [doi]', 'S1046-5928(01)91448-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 2001 Jul;22(2):330-6. doi: 10.1006/prep.2001.1448.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism of this tissue-selective cytotoxicity is, however, yet unclear. AraG is phosphorylated, and thereby pharmacologically activated, by the mitochondrial deoxguanosine kinase and the cytosolic/nuclear deoxycytidine kinase. We have recently shown that araG is predominantly incorporated into mitochondrial DNA of cancer cell lines, which suggests a role of mitochondria as its pharmacological target. In the present study, we have generated araG-resistant CEM T-lymphoblast cell lines and show that araG resistance may occur by two separate molecular mechanisms that can occur sequentially. The first mechanism is associated with a decrease of araG incorporation into mitochondrial DNA, and the second event is associated with loss of dCK activity.","['Curbo, S', 'Zhu, C', 'Johansson, M', 'Balzarini, J', 'Karlsson, A']","['Curbo S', 'Zhu C', 'Johansson M', 'Balzarini J', 'Karlsson A']","['Division of Clinical Virology F-68, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, S-141 86, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.5124 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)95124-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Jul 6;285(1):40-5. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5124.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on MEL cell proliferation was significantly greater by one order of magnitude than that on differentiation (IC(50): 9.2 vs 0.8 nM, respectively). The response of activin A-treated mature MEL cells to 1,25(OH)2D3 in the induction of 1,25(OH)2D3-24-hydroxylase (24-OHase) activity, a rapid effect of 1,25(OH)2D3, was enhanced to the same degree as in untreated immature cells, suggesting that differences in capacity of cells to inactivate 1,25(OH)2D3 did not contribute to augmentation of 1,25(OH)2D3 effect in activin A-treated mature cells. Furthermore, neither the number nor the affinity of vitamin D receptors (VDR) differed significantly between activin A-treated cells and untreated immature cells. The intracellular cAMP level, which affects 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated induction of 24-OHase activity, was significantly less in activin A-treated mature cells than in immature MEL cells. The addition of dibutyryl cAMP (dbc AMP) to activin A-treated MEL cells dose-dependently attenuated 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated induction of 24-OHase activity, finally to a level comparable to that of the untreated cells at the final concentration of 100 nM dbcAMP, while dbcAMP itself by 100 nM did not affect MEL cell differentiation by 24 h. In summary, we have shown for the first time that 1,25(OH)2D3 exerted its effect on leukemia cells at physiological concentration and that the magnitude of this effect depended on the changes in intracellular cAMP level through stages of differentiation, suggesting that the cAMP-protein kinase A system may be useful as a target for clinical application of vitamin D analogs by improving the sensitivity of leukemic cells to 1,25(OH)2D3.","['Waki, M', 'Inaba, M', 'Hiura, Y', 'Nagasaki, T', 'Imanishi, Y', 'Ishimura, E', 'Otani, S', 'Nishizawa, Y']","['Waki M', 'Inaba M', 'Hiura Y', 'Nagasaki T', 'Imanishi Y', 'Ishimura E', 'Otani S', 'Nishizawa Y']","['Division of Metabolism, Department of Biochemistry, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.- (vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Inhibins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2001/07/05 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/abbi.2001.2423 [doi]', 'S0003-9861(01)92423-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2001 Jul 15;391(2):265-70. doi: 10.1006/abbi.2001.2423.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An MSCV based retroviral vector with the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (MGIN) produced by GP+envAM12 (amphotropic envelope), PG13 (gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope) or 293GPG (vesicular stomatitis virus envelope) cell lines was used to transduce cord blood CD34+ cells on Retronectin (fibronectin fragment CH-296) in three different ways: either in vector containing medium (VCM), in fresh medium on Retronectin pre-loaded with vector or in VCM on Retronectin pre-loaded with vector. RESULTS: Paradoxically, the transduction efficiency obtained with pre-load of vector onto Retronectin alone was higher than pre-load plus VCM for PG13-MGIN (67.9 +/- 6.0% vs 24.9 +/- 8.0%) and AM12-MGIN (47.5 +/- 5.8% vs 38.7 +/- 2.2%). Further experiments showed that transduction on Retronectin pre-loaded with PG13-MGIN or AM12-MGIN was inhibited by the presence of the same VCM at high concentrations, but not by the presence of a VCM with a different receptor specificity. If no pre-load of vector was performed, the highest transduction efficiencies were seen when VCMs were diluted 1:10 (MOIs of 3). The inhibitory effect of high titer PG13-MGIN VCM was confirmed in more primitive CD34+CD38low cells and in NOD/SCID repopulating cells, and was also seen in experiments with bone marrow CD34+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: Retroviral transduction of CB CD34+ cells on Retronectin is inhibited by high titer PG13 and GP+envAM12 vector containing medium. Efficient gene transfer to human hematopoietic cells can be obtained by preload alone of the vector onto Retronectin. These findings are of importance for the design of transduction protocols for repopulating hematopoietic cells.","['Relander, T', 'Brun, A', 'Hawley, R G', 'Karlsson, S', 'Richter, J']","['Relander T', 'Brun A', 'Hawley RG', 'Karlsson S', 'Richter J']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/methods', 'Fetal Blood', 'Fibronectins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2001/07/05 10:00,2002/02/07 10:01,['2001/07/05 10:00'],"['2001/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1521-2254(200105/06)3:3<207::AID-JGM183>3.0.CO;2-O [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2001 May-Jun;3(3):207-18. doi: 10.1002/1521-2254(200105/06)3:3<207::AID-JGM183>3.0.CO;2-O.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We developed a rabbit anti-ORF50 protein polyclonal antibody, and investigated the ORF50 protein expression by immunohistochemistry using primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines and tissue sections of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), HHV-8-associated solid lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). RESULTS: Western blot analysis revealed that this antibody reacted with a 110-kd protein in the lysate of phorbolester-stimulated HHV-8-infected PEL cell lines. Immunohistochemistry revealed that a very small population of cells expressed the ORF50 protein in KS and HHV-8-associated solid lymphoma cells, and almost all these cells expressed HHV-8-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen. The ORF50 protein expression was also rare in the cells of PEL cell lines, and the staining pattern was diffuse or dot-like in the nuclei, overlapping partially with that of promyelocytic leukemia protein. In MCD, however, the ORF50 protein was expressed in some cells of the mantle zone of the lymphoid follicle. CONCLUSIONS: The ORF50 protein expression in vivo was considerably rare in KS, HHV-8-associated solid lymphoma, and PEL, but was more frequent in MCD. Rare expression of this transactivator protein in HHV-8-associated malignancies causes low expression levels of other lytic proteins and may play a role in the maintenance of the latent infection.

We describe a 17-year-old Japanese female who had increased aminotransferases without cholestasis on day 23 after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT). Liver biopsy revealed lymphocytic infiltration of the portal tracts and pericentral necrosis of the lobuli. The limiting plates were not clearly defined due to cellular infiltrates. There was periductal lymphocytic infiltration and vacuolization of the biliary epithelial cells with exocytosis, compatible with GVHD of cholangiohepatitic type.

Thirty-three adult patients with leukemia (15 AML, 3 ALL, and 15 CML) persisting or relapsing 1-36 months (median, 6) after allogeneic BMT underwent various immune manipulations and consequently developed acute and/or chronic GVHD at our center. Immunotherapies to elicit GVHD comprised chemotherapy followed by PBSC (n = 18), non-myeloablative transplant (n = 2), PBL followed by IFN-alpha (n = 5), PBL alone (n = 3), abrupt cessation of CsA (n = 3), and CsA withdrawal combined with IFN-alpha (n = 2). Twenty-four (72.7%) patients obtained a remission including complete hematological or cytogenetic remission, respectively, for acute leukemias or CML. Overall survival of patients, estimated at 3 years using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 33.9% (95% CI, 20-52%). Twelve patients including two patients with ALL remain in complete hematological (n = 5) or cytogenetic remission (n = 7) 3-93 months (median 12) after achieving remission. Twelve (63.2%) of 19 dead patients died due to treatment-related toxicities; five patients from acute GVHD, three from GVHD followed by infections and four from infections. By multivariate Cox analysis, only chronic GVHD resulted in a higher probability of disease-free survival (P = 0.026). Eight patients who had both acute GVHD < or = grade I and chronic GVHD are all alive without leukemia. We conclude that acute GVHD is associated with considerable toxicity while chronic GVHD plays a role in retaining remission in leukemia relapsing after allogeneic BMT.","['Min, C K', 'Eom, K S', 'Lee, S', 'Kim, D W', 'Lee, J W', 'Min, W S', 'Kim, C C']","['Min CK', 'Eom KS', 'Lee S', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Kim CC']","['The Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods/mortality', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/mortality', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality']",2001/07/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2000/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703021 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 May;27(9):999-1005. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The soluble form of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) was also analyzed. In patients with acute GVHD (grades II-IV), serum levels of sE-selectin and sICAM-1 increased around onset of GVHD (day 30). While the increase of sE-selectin levels was transient, sICAM-1 levels remained high until day 60. In patients with extensive chronic GVHD, sVCAM-1 as well as sE-selectin levels significantly increased. The appearance of clinical symptoms was preceded by elevations of sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin levels on day 60, and sICAM-1 levels on days 30 and 60. For the analysis of TMA, to exclude the influence of GVHD, serum levels were measured in auto-SCT patients. Around the onset of TMA, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin levels significantly increased in patients with TMA without an increase of sICAM-1 levels.

Peripheral blood counts were examined 6 months and yearly following transplantation. Median follow-up was 4.1 years (range 1-10+ years). Three years after transplantation 91% of patients had normal white blood counts (WBC), 94% normal haemoglobin (Hb) and 75% normal platelets. Trilineage recovery was complete in 70% (n = 83) at 3 years and 85% (n = 50) at 5 years. Recovery of Hb occurred before WBC and platelet recovery. Approximately 25% of patients displayed an elevated MCV throughout the follow-up period. These long-term results were independent of age, high-dose regimen, number of reinfused stem cells and stem cell source. Double (n = 12) vs single (n = 119) transplantations showed significantly slower trilineage recovery and higher MCV. No secondary graft failure, myelodysplasia or leukaemia was encountered. In conclusion, complete trilineage recovery after HDC followed by ABMT or PSCT occurs slowly. PSCT and ABMT are capable of maintaining long-term haematopoiesis. Slower recovery is seen after double transplantations. The results suggest lasting implications for bone marrow function after autologous transplantation.","['Nieboer, P', 'de Vries, E G', 'Mulder, N H', 'Sleijfer, D T', 'Willemse, P H', 'Hospers, G A', 'Gietema, J A', 'Sluiter, W J', 'van Der Graaf, W T']","['Nieboer P', 'de Vries EG', 'Mulder NH', 'Sleijfer DT', 'Willemse PH', 'Hospers GA', 'Gietema JA', 'Sluiter WJ', 'van Der Graaf WT']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Cell Count', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Graft Survival', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2001/07/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2000/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2001/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703030 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 May;27(9):959-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we demonstrate the existence of a functional LIF gene in the marsupial Sminthopsis crassicaudata, and the presence of LIF-related sequences in the monotreme Tachyglossus aculeatus (Australian echidna). Isolation of genomic and cDNA clones from S. crassicaudata, indicated that the LIF gene is highly conserved between marsupials and monotremes in terms of sequence and genomic organisation. Critical functional residues within the LIF sequence were also conserved including residues implicated in intracellular LIF activity, and in interaction with the receptor subunits LIFR and gp130. These findings suggest that the structure and biochemical function of the protein is likely to be conserved. Consistent with this, purified recombinant S. crassicaudata LIF interacted functionally with mouse receptor components and was sufficient for maintenance of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in the undifferentiated state. Conservation of LIF outside eutherians is intriguing given the markedly divergent reproductive strategies which include, for some marsupial species, embryonic diapause, and in monotremes, the absence of implantation. The availability of marsupial LIF probes provides an opportunity to investigate conservation of expression and function in these mammals.","['Cui, S', 'Hope, R M', 'Rathjen, J', 'Voyle, R B', 'Rathjen, P D']","['Cui S', 'Hope RM', 'Rathjen J', 'Voyle RB', 'Rathjen PD']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Cell Genet,Cytogenetics and cell genetics,0367735,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence/*genetics', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Exons/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*chemistry/genetics', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Marsupialia/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monotremata/*genetics', 'Multigene Family/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['56915 [pii]', '10.1159/000056915 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Cell Genet. 2001;92(3-4):271-8. doi: 10.1159/000056915.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

We report here on the rexinoid signaling capacity that triggers apoptosis of immature promyelocytic NB4 cells as a default pathway in the absence of survival factors. Rexinoid-induced apoptosis displays all features of bona fide programmed cell death and is inhibited by RXR, but not RAR antagonists. Several types of survival signals block rexinoid-induced apoptosis. RARalpha agonists switch the cellular response toward differentiation and induce the expression of antiapoptosis factors. Activation of the protein kinase A pathway in the presence of rexinoid agonists induces maturation and blocks immature cell apoptosis. Addition of nonretinoid serum factors also blocks cell death but does not induce cell differentiation. Rexinoid-induced apoptosis is linked to neither the presence nor stability of the promyelocytic leukemia-RARalpha fusion protein and operates also in non-acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Together our results support a model according to which rexinoids activate in certain leukemia cells a default death pathway onto which several other signaling paradigms converge. This pathway is entirely distinct from that triggered by RAR agonists, which control cell maturation and postmaturation apoptosis.","['Benoit, G R', 'Flexor, M', 'Besancon, F', 'Altucci, L', 'Rossin, A', 'Hillion, J', 'Balajthy, Z', 'Legres, L', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, E', 'Gronemeyer, H', 'Lanotte, M']","['Benoit GR', 'Flexor M', 'Besancon F', 'Altucci L', 'Rossin A', 'Hillion J', 'Balajthy Z', 'Legres L', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E', 'Gronemeyer H', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U-496, Centre G.

Even when effective, these drug regimens are toxic, they require demanding administration schedules, and resistant viruses can emerge. Thus the need for new gene-based therapies continues. In one such approach, capsid-targeted viral inactivation (CTVI), nucleases fused to viral coat proteins are expressed in infected cells and become incorporated during virion assembly. CTVI can eliminate infectious murine retrovirus titer in tissue culture. Here we describe transgenic mice expressing fusions of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) Gag protein to staphylococcal nuclease. This work tests the protective effect and demonstrates in vivo proof-of-principle of CTVI in transgenic mice expressing endogenous proviral copies of Mo-MuLV. The antiviral protein-expressing mice are phenotypically normal, attesting to the lack of toxicity of the fusion protein. The Mo-MuLV infection was much less virulent in transgenic littermates than in nontransgenic littermates. Gag-nuclease expression reduced infectious titers in blood up to 10-fold, decreased splenomegaly and leukemic infiltration, and increased life spans up to 2.5-fold in transgenic relative to nontransgenic infected animals. These results suggest that gene therapies based on similar fusion proteins, designed to attack human immunodeficiency virus or other retroviruses, could provide substantial therapeutic benefits.","['Schumann, G', 'Hermankova, M', 'Cannon, K', 'Mankowski, J L', 'Boeke, J D']","['Schumann G', 'Hermankova M', 'Cannon K', 'Mankowski JL', 'Boeke JD']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Longevity', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/*therapy', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*therapy', 'Virion/metabolism']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.15.7030-7041.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Aug;75(15):7030-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.15.7030-7041.2001.,PMC114431,,,['P01-AI41215/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have constructed replication-competent murine leukemia virus (MLV) vectors containing internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-transgene cassettes at the env-3' untranslated region boundary in order to examine the effects of insert sequence and size on the loss of inserts during viral replication. A virus containing an insertion of 1.6 kb replicated with greatly attenuated kinetics relative to wild-type virus and lost the inserted sequences in a single infection cycle. In contrast, MLVs containing inserts of 1.15 to 1.30 kb replicated with kinetics only slightly attenuated compared to wild-type MLV and exhibited much greater stability, maintaining their genomic integrity over multiple serial infection cycles. Eventually, multiple species of deletion mutants were detected simultaneously in later infection cycles; once detected, these variants rapidly dominated the population and thereafter appeared to be maintained at a relative equilibrium. Sequence analysis of these variants identified preferred sites of recombination in the parental viruses, including both short direct repeats and inverted repeats. One instance of insert deletion through recombination with an endogenous retrovirus was also observed. When specific sequences involved in these recombination events were eliminated, deletion variants still arose with the same kinetics upon virus passage and by apparently similar mechanisms, although at different locations in the vectors. Our results suggest that while lengthened, insert-containing genomes can be maintained over multiple replication cycles, preferential deletions resulting in loss of the inserted sequences confer a strong selective advantage.","['Logg, C R', 'Logg, A', 'Tai, C K', 'Cannon, P M', 'Kasahara, N']","['Logg CR', 'Logg A', 'Tai CK', 'Cannon PM', 'Kasahara N']","['Department of Pathology and Institute for Genetic Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (puromycin N-acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.119 (hygromycin-B kinase)']",IM,"[""*3' Untranslated Regions"", '3T3 Cells', 'Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.15.6989-6998.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Aug;75(15):6989-98. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.15.6989-6998.2001.,PMC114427,,,"['R01 CA085908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA85908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of viral proteins (or derived peptides) at the surface of an infected cell does not permit the establishment of an efficient immune attack. Such a strategy appears to have been adopted by animal oncoviruses such as bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV). In BLV-infected animals, only a small fraction of the infected lymphocytes (between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 50,000) express large amounts of viral proteins; the vast majority of the proviruses are repressed at the transcriptional level. Induction of BLV transcription involves the interaction of the virus-encoded Tax protein with the CREB/ATF factors; the resulting complex is able to interact with three 21-bp Tax-responsive elements (TxRE) located in the 5' long terminal repeat (5' LTR). These TxRE contain cyclic AMP-responsive elements (CRE), but, remarkably, the ""TGACGTCA"" consensus is never strictly conserved in any viral strain (e.g.,AGACGTCA, TGACGGCA, TGACCTCA). To assess the role of these suboptimal CREs, we introduced a perfect consensus sequence within the TxRE and showed by gel retardation assays that the binding efficiency of the CREB/ATF proteins was increased. However, trans-activation of a luciferase-based reporter by Tax was not affected in transient transfection assays. Still, in the absence of Tax, the basal promoter activity of the mutated LTR was increased as much as 20-fold. In contrast, mutation of other regulatory elements within the LTR (the E box, NF-kappa B, and glucocorticoid- or interferon-responsive sites [GRE or IRF]) did not induce a similar alteration of the basal transcription levels. To evaluate the biological relevance of these observations made in vitro, the mutations were introduced into an infectious BLV molecular clone. After injection into sheep, it appeared that all the recombinants were infectious in vivo and did not revert into a wild-type virus. All of them, except one, propagated at wild-type levels, indicating that viral spread was not affected by the mutation. The sole exception was the CRE mutant; proviral loads were drastically reduced in sheep infected with this type of virus. We conclude that a series of sites (NF-kappa B, IRF, GRE, and the E box) are not required for efficient viral spread in the sheep model, although mutation of some of these motifs might induce a minor phenotype during transient transfection assays in vitro. Remarkably, a provirus (pBLV-Delta 21-bp) harboring only two TxRE was infectious and propagated at wild-type levels. And, most importantly, reconstitution of a consensus CRE, within the 21-bp enhancers increases binding of CREB/ATF proteins but abrogates basal repression of LTR-directed transcription in vitro. Suboptimal CREs are, however, essential for efficient viral spread within infected sheep, although these sites are dispensable for infectivity. These results suggest an evolutionary selection of suboptimal CREs that repress viral expression with escape from the host immune response. These observations, which were obtained in an animal model for HTLV-1, are of interest for oncovirus-induced pathogenesis in humans.","['Merezak, C', 'Pierreux, C', 'Adam, E', 'Lemaigre, F', 'Rousseau, G G', 'Calomme, C', 'Van Lint, C', 'Christophe, D', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Burny, A', 'Kettmann, R', 'Willems, L']","['Merezak C', 'Pierreux C', 'Adam E', 'Lemaigre F', 'Rousseau GG', 'Calomme C', 'Van Lint C', 'Christophe D', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Activating Transcription Factor 2', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', '*DNA, Viral', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dogs', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/growth & development/physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Response Elements', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Cultivation', '*Virus Latency']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.15.6977-6988.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Aug;75(15):6977-88. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.15.6977-6988.2001.,PMC114426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subgroup B feline leukemia viruses (FeLV-Bs) use the gibbon ape leukemia virus receptor, Pit1, as a receptor for entry. Our previous studies showed that some chimeric envelope proteins encoding portions of FeLV-B could also enter cells by using a related receptor protein, Pit2, which serves as the amphotropic murine leukemia virus receptor (S. Boomer, M. Eiden, C. C. Burns, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 71:8116--8123, 1997). Here we show that an arginine at position 73 within variable region A (VRA) of the FeLV-B envelope surface unit (SU) is necessary for viral entry into cells via the human Pit2 receptor. However, C-terminal SU sequences have a dominant effect in determining human Pit2 entry, even though this portion of the protein is outside known receptor binding domains. This suggests that a combination of specific VRA sequences and C-terminal sequences may influence interactions between FeLV-B SU and the human Pit2 receptor. Binding studies suggest that the C-terminal sequences may affect a postbinding step in viral entry via the Pit2 receptor, although in all cases, binding of FeLV-B SU to human Pit2 was weak. In contrast, neither the arginine 73 nor specific C-terminal sequences are required for efficient binding or infection with Pit1. Taken together, these data suggest that different residues in SU may interact with these two receptors. The specific FeLV-Bs described here, which can enter cells using either human Pit receptor, may be useful as envelope pseudotypes for viruses used in gene therapy.","['Sugai, J', 'Eiden, M', 'Anderson, M M', 'Van Hoeven, N', 'Meiering, C D', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Sugai J', 'Eiden M', 'Anderson MM', 'Van Hoeven N', 'Meiering CD', 'Overbaugh J']","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC20A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC20A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.15.6841-6849.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Aug;75(15):6841-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.15.6841-6849.2001.,PMC114411,,,"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of costimulation of OX40 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by its natural ligand, gp34, the OX40-transfected ACH-2 cell line, ACH-2/OX40, chronically infected with HIV-1, was cocultured with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed gp34-transfected mouse cell line, SV-T2/gp34. The results showed that HIV-1 production was strongly induced. This was followed by apparent apoptosis, and both processes were specifically inhibited by the gp34-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody 5A8. Endogenous TNF alpha (TNF-alpha) and TNF-beta production were not involved in the enhanced HIV-1 production. Furthermore, enhanced HIV-1 transcription in gp34-stimulated ACH-2/OX40 cells was dependent on the kappa B site of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, and the OX40-gp34 interaction activated NF-kappa B consisting of p50 and p65 subunits.

The present study first shows that OX40-gp34 interaction stimulates HIV-1 expression and suggests that OX40 triggering by gp34 may play an important role in enhancing HIV-1 production in both acutely and latently infected CD4(+) T cells in vivo.","['Takahashi, Y', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Yamashita, A', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'Nakamura, M', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Takahashi Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Yamashita A', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Nakamura M', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (OX40 Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfrsf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'OX40 Ligand', 'Receptors, OX40', '*Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.15.6748-6757.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Aug;75(15):6748-57. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.15.6748-6757.2001.,PMC114401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that expression of a dominant active Notch1 (ICN1) transgene in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to thymic-independent development of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) T cells in the bone marrow (BM). To understand the function of Notch1 in early stages of T cell development, we assessed the ability of ICN1 to induce extrathymic T lineage commitment in BM progenitors from mice that varied in their capacity to form a functional pre-T cell receptor (TCR). Whereas mice repopulated with ICN1 transduced HSCs from either recombinase deficient (Rag-2(-/)-) or Src homology 2 domain--containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76)(-/)- mice failed to develop DP BM cells, recipients of ICN1-transduced Rag-2(-/)- progenitors contained two novel BM cell populations indicative of pre-DP T cell development. These novel BM populations are characterized by their expression of CD3 epsilon and pre-T alpha mRNA and the surface proteins CD44 and CD25. In contrast, complementation of Rag-2(-/)- mice with a TCR beta transgene restored ICN1-induced DP development in the BM within 3 wk after BM transfer (BMT). At later time points, this population selectively and consistently gave rise to T cell leukemia. These findings demonstrate that Notch signaling directs T lineage commitment from multipotent progenitor cells; however, both expansion and leukemic transformation of this population are dependent on T cell-specific signals associated with development of DP thymocytes.","['Allman, D', 'Karnell, F G', 'Punt, J A', 'Bakkour, S', 'Xu, L', 'Myung, P', 'Koretzky, G A', 'Pui, J C', 'Aster, J C', 'Pear, W S']","['Allman D', 'Karnell FG', 'Punt JA', 'Bakkour S', 'Xu L', 'Myung P', 'Koretzky GA', 'Pui JC', 'Aster JC', 'Pear WS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.194.1.99 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2001 Jul 2;194(1):99-106. doi: 10.1084/jem.194.1.99.,PMC2193437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because oncogenesis involves alterations in cell growth, it is important to examine the effects of Tax on cell cycle progression. Using a synchronized cell system, we have found that Tax expression accelerates G(1) phase progression and S phase entry with concomitant DNA replication. This accelerated progression is accompanied by an earlier onset of cdk2 kinase activity. In contrast to the shortening of G(1) phase, the length of S phase is unaffected by Tax expression. As a result of a more rapid cell cycle progression, cells expressing Tax exhibit faster growth kinetics and display an altered cell cycle distribution. Additionally, the decreased time allowed for growth in the presence of Tax results in a decreased cell size. Tax-associated acceleration of cell cycle progression may play a role in the ability of this viral oncoprotein to mediate cellular transformation and promote the development of human T cell leukemia virus type I-associated diseases.","['Lemoine, F J', 'Marriott, S J']","['Lemoine FJ', 'Marriott SJ']","['Interdepartmental Program of Cell and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Size/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', '*G1 Phase', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'S Phase']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M105195200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)31491-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 24;276(34):31851-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M105195200.

The ets transcription factor, TEL, undergoes translocations with several distinct tyrosine kinases including JAK2. TEL-JAK2 transforms cell lines to factor independence, and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity results in the phosphorylation of several substrates including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. In this study we have shown that TEL-JAK2 can constitutively activate the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI 3'-kinase) signaling pathway. The regulatory subunit of PI 3'-kinase, p85, associates with TEL-JAK2 in immunoprecipitations, and this was shown to be mediated by the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 but independent of a putative p85-binding motif within TEL-JAK2. The scaffolding protein Gab2 can also mediate the association of p85. TEL-JAK2 constitutively phosphorylates the downstream substrate protein kinase B/AKT. Importantly, the pharmacologic PI 3'-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, blocked TEL-JAK2 factor-independent growth and phosphorylation of protein kinase B. However, LY294002 did not alter STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that STAT5 and protein kinase B activation mediated by TEL-JAK2 are independent signaling pathways. Therefore, activation of the PI 3'-kinase signaling pathway is an important event mediated by TEL-JAK2 chromosomal translocations.","['Nguyen, M H', 'Ho, J M', 'Beattie, B K', 'Barber, D L']","['Nguyen MH', 'Ho JM', 'Beattie BK', 'Barber DL']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M103100200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77794-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 31;276(35):32704-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M103100200.

Our model is based on well-defined assumptions, uses rigorous and well-characterized statistical measures, and accounts for the heterogeneity and genomic complexity of the data. In contrast to cluster analysis, which attempts to define groups of genes and/or samples that share common overall expression profiles, our modeling approach uses known sample group membership to focus on expression profiles of individual genes in a sensitive and robust manner. Further, this approach can be used to test statistical hypotheses about gene expression. To demonstrate this methodology, we compared the expression profiles of 11 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 27 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples from a previous study (Golub et al. 1999) and found 141 genes differentially expressed between AML and ALL with a 1% significance at the genomic level. Using this modeling approach to compare different sample groups within the AML samples, we identified a group of genes whose expression profiles correlated with that of thrombopoietin and found that genes whose expression associated with AML treatment outcome lie in recurrent chromosomal locations.

In accord with this interpretation, clonotypic TEL-AML1 fusion sequences could be amplified from the archived neonatal blood spots of the leukemic twins. The blood spot of the third, healthy, dizygotic triplet was also fusion gene positive in a single segment, though at age 3 years, his blood was found negative by sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for the genomic sequence and by reverse transcription-PCR. Leukemic cells in both twins had, in addition to TEL-AML1 fusion, a deletion of the normal, nonrearranged TEL allele. However, this genetic change was found by fluorescence in situ hybridization to be subclonal in both twins.

Despite the relatively high incidence of MDS in the elderly, differentiation of MDS from de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still remains problematic. Identification of genes expressed in an MDS-specific manner would allow the molecular diagnosis of MDS. Toward this goal, AC133 surface marker-positive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like fractions have been collected from a variety of leukemias in a large-scale and long-term genomics project, referred to as ""Blast Bank,"" and transcriptome of these purified blasts from the patients with MDS were then compared with those from AML through the use of oligonucleotide microarrays. A number of genes were shown to be expressed in a disease-specific manner either to MDS or AML. Among the former found was the gene encoding the protein Delta-like (Dlk) that is distantly related to the Delta-Notch family of signaling proteins. Because overexpression of Dlk may play a role in the pathogenesis of MDS, the disease specificity of Dlk expression was tested by a quantitative ""real-time"" polymerase chain reaction analysis. Examination of the Blast Bank samples from 22 patients with MDS, 31 with AML, and 8 with chronic myeloid leukemia confirmed the highly selective expression of the Dlk gene in the individuals with MDS. Dlk could be the first candidate molecule to differentiate MDS from AML. The proposal is made that microarray analysis with the Blast Bank samples is an efficient approach to extract transcriptome data of clinical relevance for a wide range of hematologic disorders.","['Miyazato, A', 'Ueno, S', 'Ohmine, K', 'Ueda, M', 'Yoshida, K', 'Yamashita, Y', 'Kaneko, T', 'Mori, M', 'Kirito, K', 'Toshima, M', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Saito, K', 'Kano, Y', 'Furusawa, S', 'Ozawa, K', 'Mano, H']","['Miyazato A', 'Ueno S', 'Ohmine K', 'Ueda M', 'Yoshida K', 'Yamashita Y', 'Kaneko T', 'Mori M', 'Kirito K', 'Toshima M', 'Nakamura Y', 'Saito K', 'Kano Y', 'Furusawa S', 'Ozawa K', 'Mano H']","['Divisions of Functional Genomics, Hematology, Cardiology, and Molecular Immunology, Jichi Medical School, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (delta protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['DNA/*analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.2.422 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46864-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jul 15;98(2):422-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.2.422.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs is mediated by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), it was postulated that sensitivity to mitochondrial membrane depolarization might be heterogeneous in AML. Using the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (mClCCP), the mitochondrial membrane sensitivity to depolarization (mClCCP concentrations that inhibit 50% of the transmembrane potential [IC(50)]) in AML blasts was measured and demonstrated marked interclonal heterogeneity, with the existence of comparatively sensitive (median mClCCP IC(50), 4 microM) and resistant (median mClCCP IC(50), 10 microM) clones. Furthermore, the mClCCP IC(50) was inversely associated with spontaneous in vitro apoptosis (P =.001). It was high in cases with mutant TP53 and correlated with the total cellular level of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (P =.019) but not of bcl-2, bax, or bcl-x. It was also found that the dithiol oxidant diamide, in contrast to the monovalent thiol oxidant diethyl maleate, increased the sensitivity of mitochondrial membranes to mClCCP. To confirm that TP53 directly affects MTP in leukemic cells and to establish the role of vicinal thiol oxidation in the TP53-dependent pathway, CEM 4G5 leukemia cells with forced, temperature-dependent expression of TP53 were studied. Monobromobimane, which inhibits mitochondrial membrane depolarization by preventing dithiol cross-linking, inhibited depolarization and apoptosis in 4G5 cells. It was concluded that in leukemia, TP53 and vicinal thiol/disulfide status are determinants of mitochondrial membrane sensitivity to depolarization, which is in turn associated with spontaneous apoptosis.","['Pallis, M', 'Grundy, M', 'Turzanski, J', 'Kofler, R', 'Russell, N']","['Pallis M', 'Grundy M', 'Turzanski J', 'Kofler R', 'Russell N']","['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham and Nottingham City Hospital, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', ""54501-79-0 (3,3'-dihexyl-2,2'-oxacarbocyanine)"", '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', 'G81WQB56OL (diethyl maleate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Carbocyanines', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/pharmacology', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Maleates/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*ultrastructure', 'Mutation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis/genetics/physiology', 'Uncoupling Agents/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.2.405 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46862-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jul 15;98(2):405-13. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.2.405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include high transduction efficiency, ability to infect postmitotic cells, and large packaging capacity. The usefulness of HSV amplicon vectors for the transduction of primary human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was explored. Vectors were constructed encoding beta-galactosidase (LacZ), CD80 (B7.1), or CD154 (CD40L) and were packaged using either a standard helper virus (HSVlac, HSVB7.1, and HSVCD40L) or a helper virus-free method (hf-HSVlac, hf-HSVB7.1, and hf-HSVCD40L). Both helper-containing and helper-free vector stocks were studied for their ability to transduce CLL cells, up-regulate costimulatory molecules, stimulate allogeneic T-cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte tumor reaction, and generate autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Although helper-containing and helper-free amplicon stocks were equivalent in their ability to transduce CLL cells, a vigorous T-cell proliferative response was obtained using cells transduced with hf-HSVB7.1 but not with HSVB7.1. CLL cells transduced with either HSVCD40L or hf-HSVCD40L were compared for their ability to up-regulate resident B7.1 and to function as T-cell stimulators. Significantly enhanced B7.1 expression in response to CD40L was observed using hf-HSVCD40L but not with HSVCD40L. CLL cells transduced with hf-HSVCD40L were also more effective at stimulating T-cell proliferation than those transduced with HSVCD40L stocks and were successful in stimulating autologous CTL activity. It is concluded that HSV amplicons are efficient vectors for gene therapy of hematologic malignancies and that helper virus-free HSV amplicon preparations are better suited for immunotherapy.","['Tolba, K A', 'Bowers, W J', 'Hilchey, S P', 'Halterman, M W', 'Howard, D F', 'Giuliano, R E', 'Federoff, H J', 'Rosenblatt, J D']","['Tolba KA', 'Bowers WJ', 'Hilchey SP', 'Halterman MW', 'Howard DF', 'Giuliano RE', 'Federoff HJ', 'Rosenblatt JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Cancer Center, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics', 'CD40 Ligand/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.2.287 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46847-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jul 15;98(2):287-95. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.2.287.,,,,"['F30 MH012305/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 MH012305-03/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-NS36420A/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA87978-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the various inhibitors tested, only 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole [4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor, was found to induce a marked increase in caspase activity, which was associated with a loss of cell viability and a reduction in cGMP content. ODQ also provoked the processing of caspases-3 and -9, release of cytochrome c and, as early events, reduction of Bcl-2 content and dephosphorylation of Bad at Ser 112. Furthermore, YC-1, an sGC activator, and 8-Br-cGMP, a cell-permeant analogue of cGMP, exerted some protection against various apoptotic stimuli, such as serum deprivation or spermine accumulation. Although PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone), an inhibitor of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, did not increase basal caspase activity, and ODQ did not affect p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation significantly, phorbol myristate acetate stimulated p44/42 MAPK and reduced caspase activation induced by ODQ, serum deprivation, and spermine in a p44/42-dependent manner. SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole), a p38 MAPK inhibitor, also partially protected against ODQ-induced apoptosis by increasing p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. In conclusion, these results suggest that sGC may be relevant both for survival of L1210 cells under basal growing conditions and for protection against various apoptotic stimuli. p44/42 MAPK activation may also confer some protection from apoptosis, but apparently through a pathway largely independent of cGMP.","['Flamigni, F', 'Facchini, A', 'Stanic, I', 'Tantini, B', 'Bonavita, F', 'Stefanelli, C']","['Flamigni F', 'Facchini A', 'Stanic I', 'Tantini B', 'Bonavita F', 'Stefanelli C']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica G.

A mutation or deletion in a gene can provoke the complete absence of its product; sometimes expression is partial or normal but functional activity is absent or defective. In certain cases, partial or defective activity causes variant forms of the disease presenting symptomatology or atypical cellular phenotype. In other cases, this is not cause of the variant form, which can appear in interfamilial cases sharing the same mutation. In these cases, these differences can be attributed to environmental factors or to other genes able to modify the affected gene. In this article we provide examples of variant forms in several PIDs. Some are late onset forms, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemias diagnosed in adults, since until diagnosis, clinical symptomatology was minimal. In adenosine-deaminase deficiency, a serious and highly lymphoproliferative form of SCID, patients have been described whose symptomatology began after the age of 20 years. Another SCID, RAG1 and RAG2 recombinase deficiency, may produce a typical form with a characteristic T-B-NK + phenotype, Omenn's syndrome, or forms with an unexpected T-B + NK + phenotype. Deficiency in common gamma chain receptor for IL-2 may produce phenotypical variants that can lead to diagnostic error. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome may present as fulminant infectious mononucleosis, as leukemia or lymphoma or as hipo- or agammaglobulinemia. Possibly, some patients diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency or with x-linked agammaglobulinemia do in fact have this syndrome. Chronic granulomatous disease is usually of early-onset, but late-onset forms have been described. In one case the first clinical manifestation was produced when the patient was 60 years old. The above examples serve to highlight that, even though PIDs are usually suspected by pediatricians, in some cases the diagnosis may be missed by internists or non-pediatricians. Moreover, the clinical and laboratory findings of these variant forms must be determined to carry out an early diagnosis, which is essential for a favorable therapeutic outcome.","['Fontan Casariego, G']",['Fontan Casariego G'],"['Unidad de Inmunologia, Hospital La Paz, Madrid. gfontan@hulp.insalud.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr),Allergologia et immunopathologia,0370073,"['9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/deficiency/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/genetics', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complement System Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/classification/epidemiology/etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics', 'Syndrome']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-0546(01)79040-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-0546(01)79027-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr). 2001 May-Jun;29(3):101-7. doi: 10.1016/s0301-0546(01)79027-1.,,,,,25,Inmunodeficiencias primarias.

During retinoid acid (RA)- and dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP)-induced differentiation of the APL cells, there is a marked up-modulation of both the protein kinase A (PKA) and C (PKC) activities. In order to further assess whether these kinases are intimately associated with both the differentiation process and the regulation of TF and TM expression, we have correlated the modulation of their respective pathways with the extent of differentiation and modulation of these cellular receptors. NB4 cells were incubated with all-trans-RA (ATRA) or dbcAMP for up to 48 h. The contribution of phospholipase C (PLC), inositol phosphate (IP), PKC and PKA in the expression of CD11b, TF and TM was studied by the use of specific inhibitors. Myo-inositol uptake and PKC activity increased in cells induced to differentiate by ATRA but the retinoid did not affect cAMP levels or PKA activity. Under treatment with dbcAMP, PKA activity was increased while inositol uptake and PKC activity remained unchanged. Our results show that the effects of ATRA and dbcAMP on promyelocytic cells are closely related, respectively, to the PLC/IP/PKC and the cAMP/PKA pathways. In cells induced to differentiate by ATRA, CD11b expression seems more closely related to inositol uptake than to PKC activity while the expression of TF and TM show the opposite pattern, which suggests cellular events regulated at a different level within a common signal transduction pathway.","['Lopez-Pedrera, C', 'Dobado-Berrios, P M', 'Ros, R', 'Torres, A', 'Garcia-Navarro, S', 'Jardi, M', 'Felez, J', 'Velasco, F']","['Lopez-Pedrera C', 'Dobado-Berrios PM', 'Ros R', 'Torres A', 'Garcia-Navarro S', 'Jardi M', 'Felez J', 'Velasco F']","['Department of Research, Reina Sofia University Hopsital, Cordoba, Spain. pmdb@sofia.hrs.sas.cica.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism/pharmacology/physiology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thrombomodulin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/04 10:00,2002/07/12 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['01061031 [pii]'],ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2001 Jun;85(6):1031-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased levels of soluble forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors I and II, found in lymphoproliferative and infectious diseases, can interfere with TNF induced apoptotic cell death. The aim of the present study was to evaluate soluble TNF family receptors levels in lymphoproliferative disorders associated with HCV infection. METHODS: One hundred and forty-nine subjects were studied, including 120 anti-HCV positive patients (60 without lymphoproliferative manifestations, 47 with type II cryoglobulinemia and 13 with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL)) and 29 anti-HCV negative subjects (19 with low-grade B-NHLs and ten normal controls). RESULTS: Soluble forms of TNF receptor I, TNF receptor II and Fas were significantly higher in HCV positive patients compared with normal controls. The highest levels were found in patients affected by type II cryoglobulinemia or HCV positive lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas (LP-NHLs), while HCV positive patients without type II cryoglobulinemia or with other B-NHLs had lower values (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among HCV infected individuals, very high levels of soluble TNF receptors are significantly associated with type II cryoglobulinemia and LP-NHLs, suggesting that they may be involved in these proliferative disorders.","['Realdon, S', 'Pontisso, P', 'Adami, F', 'Trentin, L', 'Noventa, F', 'Ferrari, A', 'Migliorato, I', 'Gatta, A', 'Alberti, A']","['Realdon S', 'Pontisso P', 'Adami F', 'Trentin L', 'Noventa F', 'Ferrari A', 'Migliorato I', 'Gatta A', 'Alberti A']","['Clinica Medica 5, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cryoglobulinemia/blood/virology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hepacivirus/genetics', 'Hepatitis C/*blood/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*blood/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*blood', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/blood']",2001/07/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-8278(00)00063-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-8278(00)00063-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2001 May;34(5):723-9. doi: 10.1016/s0168-8278(00)00063-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the ABX Pentra 120 Retic haematology analyser in comparison to the Coulter STKS haematology system and the microscopy method with respect to accuracy, precision and reliability. We compared 308 samples (239 samples from adults and 69 from children) including patients with oncological diseases. The comparison of the white blood cell differential revealed strong correlations between the results obtained with the ABX Pentra 120 Retic and the microscopy method, the Coulter STKS and the microscopy method and both automated methods (values of paediatric samples in parentheses; neutrophils: rs > or = 0.933 (rs > or = 0.951), lymphocytes: rs > or = 0.907 (rs > or = 0.945), monocytes: rs > or = 0.584 (rs > or = 0.459) and eosinophils: rs > or = 0.963 (rs > or = 0.966)). The analytical performance of automatic analysers for the detection of the morphological ""left shift"" was determined for all samples in comparison to the microscopical white blood cell differential. The sensitivity, specificity and efficiency depended strongly on the chosen threshold levels and were different for both analysers. The sensitivity for flagging a left shift increased with an increasing proportion of neutrophil bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes and promyelocytes.

In the present study a procedure to determine appropriate iteration times for weighted averages was devised, and examined by application to mortality data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mortality data for leukemia, solid neoplasms, and traffic accidents caused by cars in Japan were employed. The smoothing method was iterating weighted averages over age-period-specific death rates and their four nearest neighbors in age-period data tables. The primary condition, which the iteration times should satisfy, was that the differences between crude data and smoothed ones were not significantly large, i.e., smoothed mortality data should be within 95% confidence intervals of crude rates. Therefore, the following steps were adopted to determine appropriate times: (1) estimation of 95% confidence intervals for crude age-period-specific mortality rates. (2) determination of iteration times under the primary condition that the proportion of cells left out of the confidence intervals should be around 5%. In cases where the proportion of cells outside of confidence intervals was still below 5% even with 10 or more times of iteration, an index of convergence of smoothing was introduced and used to determine appropriate iteration times. RESULTS: For solid neoplasms, appropriate times of iteration was three. With leukemia, the proportion of cells left out of their confidence intervals remained within 5% with iteration 27 times. Therefore, an index of convergence for the smoothing process was used to avoid over-smoothing. As a result, a value of five was obtained. In the case of car traffic accidents, even only a single smoothing did not fulfill the primary condition, because mortality rates increased very rapidly from age classes of 10-14 to 15-19, the mortality rates for the latter being about ten times larger. To deal with this, the proportion of cells left out of their confidence intervals was calculated excluding these age classes. As a result, five times was found to be appropriate. CONCLUSION: The smoothing method in this study is simple and easy to apply to mortality data. And procedure to determine appropriate iteration times is based on an inferential statistical method. Applying the method to three kinds of mortality data, it was found to be practical and useful for clarification of their characteristics and trends.","['Negishi, S', 'Yokoyama, H']","['Negishi S', 'Yokoyama H']","['Department of Medical Information Science, Jichi Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi,[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health,19130150R,,IM,"['Accidents, Traffic/*mortality', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi. 2001 May;48(5):367-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By FISH and Southern blot analyses we identified a rearrangement in the MLL gene due to a novel t(3;11)(q28;q23) chromosomal translocation in a patient who developed AML-M5 3 years after treatment for a follicular lymphoma. Through inverse PCR, the LPP (lipoma preferred partner) gene on 3q28 was identified as the MLL fusion partner. LPP contains substantial identity to the focal adhesion protein, zyxin, and is frequently fused to HMGIC in lipomas. The breakpoint occurred in intron 8 of MLL and LPP. Two in-frame MLL-LPP transcripts, which fuse MLL exon 8 to LPP exon 9, were detected by RT-PCR, although the smaller of these contained a deletion of 120 bp from the MLL sequence. The predicted MLL-LPP fusion protein includes the A/T hook motifs and methyltransferase domain of MLL joined to the two last LIM domains of LPP. A reciprocal LPP-MLL transcript, predicted to include the proline-rich and leucine zipper motifs, and the first LIM domain of LPP were also detected by RT-PCR. In summary, LPP is a newly identified MLL fusion partner in secondary leukemia resulting from topoisomerase inhibitors. The MLL-LPP and LPP-MLL predicted proteins contain many of the features present in other MLL rearrangements.","['Daheron, L', 'Veinstein, A', 'Brizard, F', 'Drabkin, H', 'Lacotte, L', 'Guilhot, F', 'Larsen, C J', 'Brizard, A', 'Roche, J']","['Daheron L', 'Veinstein A', 'Brizard F', 'Drabkin H', 'Lacotte L', 'Guilhot F', 'Larsen CJ', 'Brizard A', 'Roche J']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie (CNRS FRE 2224), Poitiers University Hospital, CHU La Miletrie BP577, 86021 Poitiers Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LPP protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.1157 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Aug;31(4):382-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1157.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Using detailed allelotype analysis on a range of lympho-haematopoietic tumour types arising in F1 hybrid mice, we now show a consistent pattern of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) which identifies a common region of loss delineated by microsatellites D4Mit21 and D4Mit53 on proximal chromosome 4. This critical segment corresponds to the thymic lymphoma tumour suppressor region 5 (TLSR5) identified in an earlier study. Tumours of this type have also been reported as showing allelic loss from the Trp53 and Ikaros regions on chromosome 11. In the present study, only a small fraction of tumours showed LOH in the Ikaros region, while a minority of lymphomas, but not acute myeloid leukaemias, showed allelic loss of the chromosome 11 segment encoding Trp53. These and other data indicate strongly that the genomic regions identified as showing recurrent LOH depend on the genetic background of the mice. Overall, the results indicate a key role for a tumour suppressor gene(s) encoded in an approximately 3 cM segment on proximal chromosome 4 and provide an experimental basis for the further investigation of the functional role of candidate genes which include Pax5 and Tgfbr1.","['Meijne, E', 'Huiskamp, R', 'Haines, J', 'Moody, J', 'Finnon, R', 'Wilding, J', 'Spanjer, S', 'Bouffler, S', 'Edwards, A', 'Cox, R', 'Silver, A']","['Meijne E', 'Huiskamp R', 'Haines J', 'Moody J', 'Finnon R', 'Wilding J', 'Spanjer S', 'Bouffler S', 'Edwards A', 'Cox R', 'Silver A']","['Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group (NRG), Petten, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes/radiation effects', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.1156 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Aug;31(4):373-81. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1156.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

We studied 52 extranodal B-cell lymphomas: 18 extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT type (MZBL,MT), 7 MZBL,MT of the gastro-intestinal tract with a diffuse large B-cell component (giMZBLplusLBCL), and 27 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the gastro-intestinal tract without small cell component (giLBCL). Analytical techniques were comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The translocation t(11;18) was found as the sole aberration in two MZBL,MT only. In contrast to this, t(11;18)-negative MZBL,MT were characterized by frequent gains on chromosome 3 and DNA amplifications on 2p13-p15. Furthermore, we found a clonal lymphoma progression from the small to the large cell component with accumulation of gains and losses of chromosomal material in the large cell component in giMZBLplusLBCL. Aberrations overlapping with MZBL,MT and giMZBLplusLBCL included losses on chromosome 13, amplifications of the REL proto-oncogene, or gains on chromosome 12. In addition, the large cell component revealed gains on 8q24, including amplifications of the MYC proto-oncogene, and losses on 2q. The giLBCL had frequent gains on chromosomes 12 and 9, as well as on 11q, and losses on 6q. We conclude that, based on the distinctive and partly overlapping patterns of genetic aberrations, MALT lymphomas can be divided into different genetic subgroups.","['Barth, T F', 'Bentz, M', 'Leithauser, F', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Siebert, R', 'Schlotter, M', 'Schlenk, R F', 'Dohner, H', 'Moller, P']","['Barth TF', 'Bentz M', 'Leithauser F', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Siebert R', 'Schlotter M', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner H', 'Moller P']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, D-89091 Ulm, Germany. thomas.barth@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Clone Cells', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.1150 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Aug;31(4):316-25. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1150.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, its use is hampered by the associated graft-versus-host disease. The critical issue of a possible dissociation of the antileukemic effect and graft-versus-host disease by targeting specific minor histocompatibility antigens remains unresolved because of the unknown nature and number of minor histocompatibility antigens necessary or sufficient to elicit anti-leukemic activity and graft-versus-host disease. We found that injection of T lymphocytes primed against a single major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigen (B6dom1) caused no graft-versus-host disease but produced a curative anti-leukemic response. Avoidance of graft-versus-host disease required that no other host-reactive T cells be co-injected with T cells primed with B6dom1. Here we show that effective and non-toxic immunotherapy of hematologic malignancies can be achieved by targeting a single immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigen.","['Fontaine, P', 'Roy-Proulx, G', 'Knafo, L', 'Baron, C', 'Roy, D C', 'Perreault, C']","['Fontaine P', 'Roy-Proulx G', 'Knafo L', 'Baron C', 'Roy DC', 'Perreault C']","['Guy-Bernier Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/89907 [doi]', '89907 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2001 Jul;7(7):789-94. doi: 10.1038/89907.,,,,,,,,,['Nat Med. 2001 Jul;7(7):769-70.

Analysis of the extension products in the presence of the four dNTPs or of a single dNTP showed that the M-MuLV RT was completely blocked and did not incorporate any dNMP opposite 2'-deoxyribonolactone. KF exo(-) preferentially incorporated nucleotides opposite the lesion following the frequency order dAMP > dGMP >> dTMP approximately dCMP and thus appeared to obey the 'A rule' for preferential incorporation as has been shown previously for the 2'-deoxyribose abasic site. In the sequence context examined, the primer extension by KF exo(-) appeared to be less efficient when dAMP was positioned opposite the lesion as compared with dTMP or dGMP. These two nucleotides promoted a more efficient polymerization accompanied by nucleotide deletion through misalignment incorporations. We therefore predict that the sequence context may strongly influence the translesional synthesis by KF exo(-) and thus the miscoding and mutational potential of the 2'-deoxyribonolactone in E.coli.","['Berthet, N', 'Roupioz, Y', 'Constant, J F', 'Kotera, M', 'Lhomme, J']","['Berthet N', 'Roupioz Y', 'Constant JF', 'Kotera M', 'Lhomme J']","['LEDSS, Chimie Bioorganique, UMR CNRS 5616, Universite Joseph Fourier, BP 53, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 9, France. nathalie.berthet@ujf-grenoble.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Sugar Acids)', '34371-14-7 (2,4,5-trihydroxypentanoic acid gamma-lactone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'DNA/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA Polymerase I/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Mutagenesis/genetics', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Sugar Acids/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/29.13.2725 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jul 1;29(13):2725-32. doi: 10.1093/nar/29.13.2725.,PMC55770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population comprised 142 patients with AML in first relapse with no history of an antecedent hematologic disorder and a median age of 61 years. All patients received Mylotarg as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, at a dose of 9 mg/m(2), at 2-week intervals for two doses. Patients were evaluated for remission, survival, and treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients treated with Mylotarg obtained remission as characterized by 5% or less blasts in the marrow, recovery of neutrophils to at least 1,500/microL, and RBC and platelet transfusion independence. Although patients treated with Mylotarg had relatively high incidences of myelosuppression, grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (23%), and elevated hepatic transaminase levels (17%), the incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (4%) and infections (28%) were relatively low. There was a low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (11%) and no treatment-related cardiotoxicity, cerebellar toxicity, or alopecia. Many patients received Mylotarg on an outpatient basis (38% and 41% of patients for the first and second doses, respectively). Among the 142 patients, the median total duration of hospitalization was 24 days; 16% of patients required 7 days of hospitalization or less. CONCLUSION: Administration of the antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent Mylotarg to patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse induces complete remissions with what appears to be a favorable safety profile.","['Sievers, E L', 'Larson, R A', 'Stadtmauer, E A', 'Estey, E', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Dombret, H', 'Karanes, C', 'Theobald, M', 'Bennett, J M', 'Sherman, M L', 'Berger, M S', 'Eten, C B', 'Loken, M R', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Sievers EL', 'Larson RA', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Estey E', 'Lowenberg B', 'Dombret H', 'Karanes C', 'Theobald M', 'Bennett JM', 'Sherman ML', 'Berger MS', 'Eten CB', 'Loken MR', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Bernstein ID', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, and Hematologics Inc, Seattle WA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'North America/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Survival Rate']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.13.3244 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jul 1;19(13):3244-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.13.3244.,,,['Mylotarg Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A matched-pair analysis was performed within a homogeneous group of children with first relapse of BCR-ABL-negative B-cell precursor (BPC) ALL treated according to relapse trials ALL-Rezidiv (REZ) of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group. A total of 249 patients were eligible for this study: 53 (21%) were positive for TEL-AML1, and 196 (79%) were negative. Positive patients were matched for established most-significant prognostic determinants at relapse, time point, and site of relapse, as well as age and peripheral blast cell count at relapse. RESULTS: Fifty pairs matching the aforementioned criteria could be determined. The probabilities with SE of event-free survival and survival at 5 years for matched TEL-AML1 positives and negatives are 0.63 +/- 0.10 versus 0.38 +/- 0.10 (P =.09) and 0.82 +/- 0.09 versus 0.42 +/- 0.19 (P =.10), respectively. These results were confirmed by multivariate analysis, revealing an independent prognostic significance of time point and site of relapse (both P <.001) but not of TEL-AML1 expression (P =.09). CONCLUSION: TEL-AML1 expression does not constitute an independent risk factor in relapsed childhood BCP-ALL after matching for relevant prognostic parameters. It undoubtedly characterizes genetically an ALL entity associated with established favorable prognostic parameters.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled onto a trial conducted in central Japan between 1989 and 1992. Treatment consisted of standard four-drug induction therapy followed by a risk-based intensification phase, reinduction therapy, late intensification, and remission maintenance therapy (total of 104 weeks). The initial lumbar puncture, with an intrathecal injection of chemotherapy, was performed after 1 week of prednisolone sensitivity testing (day 8). End points included response to prednisolone, CNS status at the time of the day 8 lumbar puncture, subsequent adverse events in CNS and bone marrow, and event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: The remission induction rate was 93.1% with a 6-year EFS rate (+/- SE) of 68.7% +/- 2.4%, which is similar to historical results for patients who received their diagnostic lumbar puncture and first instillation of intrathecal chemotherapy on day 0. Overall, 84.5% of the patients had good responses to prednisolone, whereas 15.5% had poor responses. Clinical outcome was strikingly better for the good responders (6-year EFS, 74.1% +/- 2.5% compared with 40.1% +/- 6.4% for patients with poor responses), suggesting that omission of intrathecal chemotherapy did not alter the predictive value of drug sensitivity testing. Eighteen patients experienced CNS relapse as their first adverse event (cumulative risk, 5.1%; 95% confidence interval, 2.7% to 7.4%), coincident with reports from groups using conventional strategies of CNS clinical management. Bleeding into the CSF at the time of the day 8 lumbar puncture was apparent in 29 cases (8.1%), but leukemic blasts were identified in only two.

The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study assessed overall and cause-specific mortality in a retrospective cohort of 20,227 5-year survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible subjects were individuals diagnosed with cancer (from 1970 to 1986) before the age of 21 who had survived 5 years from diagnosis. Underlying cause of death was obtained from death certificates and other sources and coded and categorized as recurrent disease, sequelae of cancer treatment, or non-cancer-related. Age and sex standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using United States population mortality data. RESULTS: The cohort, including 208,947 person-years of follow-up, demonstrated a 10.8-fold excess in overall mortality (95% confidence interval, 10.3 to 11.3). Risk of death was statistically significantly higher in females (SMR = 18.2), individuals diagnosed with cancer before the age of 5 years (SMR = 14.0), and those with an initial diagnosis of leukemia (SMR = 15.5) or CNS tumor (SMR = 15.7). Recurrence of the original cancer was the leading cause of death among 5-year survivors, accounting for 67% of deaths. Statistically significant excess mortality rates were seen due to subsequent malignancies (SMR = 19.4), along with cardiac (SMR = 8.2), pulmonary (SMR = 9.2), and other causes (SMR = 3.3). Treatment-related associations were present for subsequent cancer mortality (radiation, alkylating agents, epipodophyllotoxins), cardiac mortality (chest irradiation, bleomycin), and other deaths (radiation, anthracyclines). No excess mortality was observed for external causes (SMR = 0.8). CONCLUSION: While recurrent disease remains a major contributor to late mortality in 5-year survivors of childhood cancer, significant excesses in mortality risk associated with treatment-related complications exist up to 25 years after the initial cancer diagnosis.","['Mertens, A C', 'Yasui, Y', 'Neglia, J P', 'Potter, J D', 'Nesbit, M E Jr', 'Ruccione, K', 'Smithson, W A', 'Robison, L L']","['Mertens AC', 'Yasui Y', 'Neglia JP', 'Potter JD', 'Nesbit ME Jr', 'Ruccione K', 'Smithson WA', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School and Cancer Center, Minneapolis, USA. mertens@epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Sex Distribution', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.13.3163 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jul 1;19(13):3163-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.13.3163.,,,,['CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jul 1;19(13):3161-2.

Recently, it was proven that Ral regulates c-Src activity and subsequent phosphorylation of its substrate, STAT3. Here, we show that STAT3 inversely regulates activation of Ral through induction of expression of RalGDS. To identify new leukemia inhibitory factor-induced genes, we have performed representational difference analysis using M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells and cloned RalGDS. The expression of RalGDS and subsequent activation of RalA were clearly suppressed by a dominant negative form of STAT3 and a JAK inhibitor, JAB/SOCS1/SSI-1, indicating that RalGDS/RalA signaling requires the activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. An experiment using a Ras inhibitor demonstrated that full activation of RalA also requires activation of Ras. These results suggest a novel cross-talk between JAK/STAT3 and the Ras/RalGDS/Ral signaling pathways through gp130.","['Senga, T', 'Iwamoto, T', 'Kitamura, T', 'Miyake, Y', 'Hamaguchi, M']","['Senga T', 'Iwamoto T', 'Kitamura T', 'Miyake Y', 'Hamaguchi M']","['Department of Molecular Pathogenesis, Nagoya University School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-Ku, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (ral Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Rala protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ral GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ral GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'ral Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor/*genetics/*metabolism']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M105749200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77790-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 31;276(35):32678-81. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M105749200.

The PPE (TAATAAATCAA) is identical to a consensus HOX.PBX binding sequence. Further, PBX1b has been shown to be a component of a PPE-specific binding complex present in nuclear extracts from As4.1 cells. The binding affinities of different paralog HOX members to the PPE were examined in the absence or presence of PBX1b. HOXB6, -B7, and -C8 failed to bind the PPE alone but showed weak affinity in the presence of PBX1b. In contrast, HOXD10 and to a lesser degree HOXB9 bound the PPE with high affinities regardless of whether PBX1b was present. Abd-B HOX members, including HOXD10, -A10, -A9, -B9, and -C9, are expressed in As4.1 cells. The ability of HOX and PBX1b to form a ternary complex with PREP1 on the PPE is also demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Point mutations in either the HOX or PBX half-site of the PPE disrupted the formation of the HOX.PBX complex and dramatically decreased transcriptional activity of the Ren-1(c) gene demonstrating that both the HOX and PBX half-sites are critical for mouse renin gene expression. These results strongly implicate Abd-B class Hox genes and their cofactors as major determinants of the sites of renin expression.","['Pan, L', 'Xie, Y', 'Black, T A', 'Jones, C A', 'Pruitt, S C', 'Gross, K W']","['Pan L', 'Xie Y', 'Black TA', 'Jones CA', 'Pruitt SC', 'Gross KW']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB6 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (HOXC8 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hoxb6 protein, rat)', '0 (Hoxb7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hoxc8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Renin/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M011541200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77766-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 31;276(35):32489-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M011541200.

The number and the intensity of PML NBs increase in response to interferon (IFN). Overexpression of PML affects the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. However, PML has a less powerful antiviral activity against these viruses than the IFN mediator MxA. Here, we show that overexpression of PML, but not that of Mx1 or MxA, leads to a drastic decrease of a complex retrovirus, the human foamy virus (HFV), gene expression. PML represses HFV transcription by complexing the HFV transactivator, Tas, preventing its direct binding to viral DNA. This physical interaction requires the N-terminal region of Tas and the RING finger of PML, but does not necessitate PML localization in NBs. Finally, we show that IFN treatment inhibits HFV replication in wild-type but not in PML-/- cells. These findings point to a role for PML in transcriptional repression and suggest that PML could play a key role in mediating an IFN-induced antiviral state against a complex retrovirus.","['Regad, T', 'Saib, A', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, V', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'de The, H', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K']","['Regad T', 'Saib A', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Pandolfi PP', 'de The H', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['CNRS UPR 9051, Hopital St Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MX1 protein, human)', '0 (Mx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*metabolism', 'Astrocytoma', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/physiology/virology', '*GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Glioblastoma', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'L Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spumavirus/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2001/07/04 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/20.13.3495 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Jul 2;20(13):3495-505. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.13.3495.,PMC125516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary objective was to test the feasibility of assessing partners' QoL in a cooperative group setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients and partners were separately interviewed by telephone at baseline, two, four and six months by a single trained research interviewer. Patients' QoL was measured by the FACT-P, Mental Health Inventory-17 (MHI-17), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), a two-day log of pain medications, and the OARS for co-morbid conditions. Partners' QoL was measured by the MHI-17, Caregiver Burden Interview, and co-morbid conditions. RESULTS: The QoL study refusal rates were low for patients (4%) and partners (3%). Although patients tended to experience greater treatment side effects in the first two months (FACT Physical Well-Being item, P = 0.057), their cancer-specific emotions (e.g., worrying about worsening health) significantly improved at two and four months (FACT-Emotional Well-Being, P = 0.003, P = 0.03, respectively), as did their prostate cancer-specific physical problems (e.g., urination, pain), at two and four months (FACT-P, P = 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively). Partners' anxiety significantly decreased over time (MHI, P < 0.05). Patients' quality of life at two months was significantly related to their clinical response (FACT-P total and prostate cancer-specific problems, P < 0.05), and their clinical response was significantly related to a decrease in their partners' anxiety at two months (MHI, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite feeling worse from side effects, patients' prostate cancer-specific problems and emotional state significantly improved in the first four months of treatment. With treatment significantly affecting both patients' and partners' lives. and the successful assessment of partners' QoL, QoL of both patients and partners could be used as important endpoints in selected clinical trials.","['Kornblith, A B', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Zuckerman, E', 'Godley, P A', 'Savarese, D', 'Vogelzang, N J']","['Kornblith AB', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Zuckerman E', 'Godley PA', 'Savarese D', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, NYC, New York, USA. akornbli@bethisraelny.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '35LT29625A (Estramustine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Anxiety', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Emotions', 'Estramustine/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Pain', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*complications/*drug therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Spouses', '*Taxoids']",2001/07/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1011102619058 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)54116-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2001 May;12(5):633-41. doi: 10.1023/a:1011102619058.,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)'],"['CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), TK levels may provide prognostic information independent of stage and other prognostic factors, but it is still unclear whether they can be used to predict the response to treatment and length of survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine whether TK levels can be used to predict response and survival, we retrospectively examined the serum TK level in 188 previously treated and untreated patients with active or advanced CLL who were then treated with fludarabine alone or in combination with prednisone. The correlation of the TK level with other prognostic features and with outcome was then assessed. RESULTS: Serum TK levels were elevated in 92% of the patients, and the levels proved to associate with previous treatment, stage of disease, and other tumor-burden related features (i.e., white blood cell counts, absolute lymphocyte count, bone marrow cellularity). The levels were also directly associated with indicators of tumor cell turnover (i.e., beta2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase levels). Of particular importance, we found that the TK level was a significant prognostic indicator of both response to treatment and survival. Specifically, 83% of patients with a TK level of < 10 U/L responded (complete and partial response) to treatment with fludarabine, whereas only 45% of patients with a TK level of > or = 10 U/l responded to treatment (P < 0.01). This difference was maintained when we separately analyzed untreated and previously treated patients, and in patients divided according to the Binet stage. The TK level also added prognostic information about response to a predictive model based on the hemoglobin and, albumin levels and the extent of prior treatment. Of further importance, the median survival rate in patients with a TK level of < 10 U/l was 65%, as opposed to a rate of 22% in patients with a TK level of > or = 10 U/l (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The serum TK level in CLL patients provides useful prognostic information regarding both response to therapy and length of survival and should be used in planning appropriate therapy. In particular, patients with a TK level of > or = 10 U/l have a poor prognosis and should be considered for aggressive treatment.","['Di Raimondo, F', 'Giustolisi, R', 'Lerner, S', 'Cacciola, E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Keating, M J']","['Di Raimondo F', 'Giustolisi R', 'Lerner S', 'Cacciola E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Catania, Ospedale Ferrarotto, Italy. diraimon@sirio-oncology.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thymidine Kinase/*analysis/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2001/07/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1011138825593 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)54114-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2001 May;12(5):621-5. doi: 10.1023/a:1011138825593.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fatty acids from pomegranate, tung, and catalpa were cytotoxic to human monocytic leukemia cells at concentrations exceeding 5 microM for pomegranate and tung and 10 microM for catalpa, but fatty acids from pot marigold oil had no effect at concentrations ranging up to 163 microM. The main conjugated fatty acids of pomegranate, tung, catalpa, and pot marigold were cis(c)9,trans(t)11,c13-CLN (71.7%), c9,t11,t13-CLN (70.1%), t9,t11,c13-CLN (31.3%), and t8,t10,c12-CLN (33.4%), respectively. Therefore, the cytotoxicities of fatty acids from pomegranate, tung, and catalpa were supposed to be due to 9,11,13-CLN isomers. To elucidate the cytotoxicity of these CLN, we separated each CLN isomer from the fatty acid mixtures by high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed its cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicities of c9,t11,c13-CLN, c9,t11,t13-CLN, and t9,t11,c13-CLN were much stronger than that of t8,t10,c12-CLN. Therefore, the higher cytotoxicity of fatty acids from pomegranate, tung, and catalpa than those from pot marigold would be derived from the different activities of 9,11,13-CLN and 8,10,12-CLN. Since there was little difference in the cytotoxicities of c9,t11,c13-CLN,c9,t11,t13-CLN, and t9,t11,c13-CLN, it is suggested that the cis/trans configuration of 9,11,13-CLN isomers had little effect on their cytotoxic effects. The mechanism of the cytotoxicity of the four fatty acids above may involve lipid peroxidation, because the order of toxicity of the fatty acids was consistent with their susceptibility to peroxidation in aqueous phase. This was supported by the decrease in the cytotoxicity of the fatty acids by addition of butylated hydroxytoluene.","['Suzuki, R', 'Noguchi, R', 'Ota, T', 'Abe, M', 'Miyashita, K', 'Kawada, T']","['Suzuki R', 'Noguchi R', 'Ota T', 'Abe M', 'Miyashita K', 'Kawada T']","['Division of Marine Bioscience, Graduate School of Fisheries Science, Hokkaido University, Hakodate, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Linoleic Acids)', '0 (Plant Oils)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Linoleic Acids/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plant Oils/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Seeds/*chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/04 10:00'],"['2001/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11745-001-0746-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 2001 May;36(5):477-82. doi: 10.1007/s11745-001-0746-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These markers include surface markers or rearranged T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes in the lymphoid malignancies and fused genes associated with chromosomal translocations such as BCR-ABL in t(9;22) or PML-RAR alpha in t(15;17) in myeloid malignancies. The expression of the WT1 gene is recognized as the universal tumor marker for a wide variety of hematological malignancies. Using these sensitive markers, a tumor cell in 10,000 to 1,000,000 normal cells can be detected. By examining a large number of patients, it has been shown that the MRD in the early phase of chemotherapy has a correlation with the prognosis of childhood ALL. Based on these observations, a new strategy of chemotherapy in which the post-remission therapy is modified based on the MRD results has begun. The amount of tumor cells contaminated in the autologous stem cell grafts in ALL patients might be related to the prognosis.

However, the response of leukemic cells to signals transduced by the BM microenvironment is not completely understood. The present study describes a new human B-lineage ALL cell line designated BLIN-4 (B LINeage-4). BLIN-4 cells respond to multiple cytokines/human BM stromal cell-derived molecules. One subline (BLIN-4E) undergoes cell death in the absence of BM stromal cells or cytokines and slowly proliferates on human BM stromal cells supplemented with interleukin (IL)-7 + FLT3-ligand. Another subline (BLIN-4L) slowly proliferates in the absence of cytokines and BM stromal cells and shows robust proliferation on BM stromal cells supplemented with IL-7 + FLT3-ligand. Although human BM stromal cells are comparable with IL-7 + FLT3-ligand in supporting proliferation of BLIN-4L cells, neutralizing antibody experiments demonstrate that BLIN-4L expansion on BM stromal cells is IL-7/FLT3-ligand independent. BLIN-4L could also respond to human thymic stromal lymphopoietin. BLIN-4E and BLIN-4L have the identical immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement and a CD10(+)/CD19(+)/CD20(-)/CD22(+)/CD40(+)/mu heavy chain(-) phenotype. The original BM leukemic blasts harbored a ring chromosome 4 with a low percentage of cells also having either trisomy 8 or trisomy 18. The BLIN-4 sublines maintained the ring chromosome 4, but the trisomy 8 and trisomy 18 segregated into BLIN-4E and BLIN-4L, respectively. Thus, the BLIN-4 sublines exhibit biological characteristics consistent with a potential evolution in B-lineage ALL involving subclones with decreasing requirements on the BM microenvironment.","['Shah, N', 'Oseth, L', 'Tran, H', 'Hirsch, B', 'LeBien, T W']","['Shah N', 'Oseth L', 'Tran H', 'Hirsch B', 'LeBien TW']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'GT0IL38SP4 (thymic stromal lymphopoietin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/biosynthesis', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/06/30 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/30 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jul 1;61(13):5268-74.,,,,"['R01 CA31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA76055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, higher radiation doses could be delivered to leukemia cells by antibody if the systemic therapy were decreased or eliminated. To examine the ability of (131)I-anti-CD45 antibody to provide sufficient immunosuppression for transplantation across allogeneic barriers, T-cell-depleted BALB.B marrow was transplanted into H2-compatible B6-Ly5(a) mice after (131)I-30F11 (rat antimurine CD45) antibody with or without varying dose levels of total body irradiation (TBI). Groups of five or six recipient mice per (131)I or TBI dose level per experiment were given tail vein injections of 100 microg of (131)I-labeled 30F11 antibody 4 days before marrow infusion, with or without TBI on day 0. Engraftment, defined as > or =50% donor B cells at 3 months posttransplant, was determined by two-color flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood granulocytes, T cells, and B cells using antibodies specific for donor and host CD45 allotypes and for CD3. Donor engraftment of > or =80% recipient mice was achieved with either 8 Gy of TBI or 0.75 mCi of (131)I-30F11 antibody, which delivers an estimated 26 Gy to bone marrow. Subsequent experiments determined the dose of TBI alone or TBI plus 0.75 mCi of (131)I-30F11 antibody necessary for engraftment in recipient mice that had been presensitized to donor antigens before transplant, a setting requiring more stringent immunosuppression. Engraftment was seen in > or =80% of presensitized recipients surviving after 14-16 Gy of TBI or 12-14 Gy of TBI and 0.75 mCi of (131)I-30F11 antibody. However, only 28 of 69 (41%) presensitized mice receiving 10-16 Gy of TBI alone survived, presumably because of rejection of donor marrow and ablation of host hematopoiesis. In contrast, 29 of 35 (83%) presensitized mice receiving (131)I-30F11 antibody and 10-14 Gy of TBI survived, presumably because the additional immunosuppression provided by estimated radiation doses of 53 Gy to lymph nodes and 81 Gy to spleen from 0.75 mCi of (131)I-30F11 antibody permitted engraftment of donor marrow. These results suggest that targeted radiation delivered by (131)I-anti-CD45 antibody provides sufficient immunosuppression to replace an appreciable portion of the TBI dose used in matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant.","['Ruffner, K L', 'Martin, P J', 'Hussell, S', 'Nourigat, C', 'Fisher, D R', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Matthews, D C']","['Ruffner KL', 'Martin PJ', 'Hussell S', 'Nourigat C', 'Fisher DR', 'Bernstein ID', 'Matthews DC']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Immunization', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*pharmacology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Radioimmunotherapy/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2001/06/30 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/30 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jul 1;61(13):5126-31.,,,,"['T32 CA009515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of U937 monocytic leukemia cells to a marginally toxic concentration of UCN-01 (e.g., 150 nM) for 18 h resulted in phosphorylation/activation of p42/44 MAPK. Coadministration of the MEK inhibitor PD184352 (10 microM) blocked UCN-01-induced MAPK activation and was accompanied by marked mitochondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c release and loss of DeltaPsi(m)), caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were noted in the case of other MEK inhibitors (e.g., PD98059; U0126) as well as in multiple other leukemia cell types (e.g., HL-60, Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, and Raji). Coadministration of PD184352 and UCN-01 resulted in reduced binding of the cdc25C phosphatase to 14-3-3 proteins, enhanced dephosphorylation/activation of p34(cdc2), and diminished phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein. The ability of UCN-01, when combined with PD184352, to antagonize cdc25C/14-3-3 protein binding, promote dephosphorylation of p34(cdc2), and potentiate apoptosis was mimicked by the ataxia telangectasia mutation inhibitor caffeine. In contrast, cotreatment of cells with UCN-01 and PD184352 did not substantially increase c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase activation nor did it alter expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Bax, or X-inhibitor of apoptosis. However, coexposure of U937 cells to UCN-01 and PD184352 induced a marked increase in p38 MAPK activation. Moreover, SB203580, which inhibits multiple kinases including p38 MAPK, partially antagonized cell death. Lastly, although UCN-01 +/- PD184352 did not induce p21(CIP1), stable expression of a p21(CIP1) antisense construct significantly increased susceptibility to this drug combination. Together, these findings indicate that exposure of leukemic cells to UCN-01 leads to activation of the MAPK cascade and that interruption of this process by MEK inhibition triggers perturbations in several signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways that culminate in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis. They also raise the possibility that disrupting multiple signaling pathways, e.g., by combining UCN-01 with MEK inhibitors, may represent a novel antileukemic strategy.","['Dai, Y', 'Yu, C', 'Singh, V', 'Tang, L', 'Wang, Z', 'McInistry, R', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Dai Y', 'Yu C', 'Singh V', 'Tang L', 'Wang Z', 'McInistry R', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (U 0126)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Butadienes/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/enzymology']",2001/06/30 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/30 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jul 1;61(13):5106-15.,,,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor runt-related gene 2 (RUNX2)/core binding factoralpha-1/acute myeloid leukemia 3/polyoma enhancer-binding protein 2alphaA/osteoblast-specific transcription factor 2 regulates osteoblast differentiation, increases lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice, and is expressed in murine ECs. Here, we report on RUNX2 expression in human bone marrow EC (HBME-1) and its role in EC differentiation. Expression of RUNX2 occurred in HBME-1 cultured on extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates that stimulate in vitro differentiation (tube formation). Neutralizing anti-insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I-receptor antibody inhibited tube formation as well as activation of RUNX2 expression in HBME-1 cultured on ECM. IGF-I treatment also increased both RUNX2 mRNA and protein expression. HBME-1 transfectants expressing dominant-negative (DN) RUNX were established to address the role of RUNX2 in these processes. HBME/DN cells exhibited reduced tube formation activity relative to control transfectants and less ability to growth arrest and differentiate on ECM. DNRUNX expression also inhibited HBME-1 migration and invasion, which are necessary for tube formation. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator and membrane-type MMP-1 genes were consistently down-regulated in DNRUNX transfectants. The results suggest that RUNX2 is important in IGF-I and ECM-regulated EC migration and differentiation. RUNX2 effects on HBME-1 migration and invasion may occur through activation of protease expression, events that regulate angiogenesis, and tumor growth.","['Sun, L', 'Vitolo, M', 'Passaniti, A']","['Sun L', 'Vitolo M', 'Passaniti A']","['Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Endopeptidases/biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",2001/06/30 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/30 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jul 1;61(13):4994-5001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further show that the HIV genome associates with these proteins before nuclear migration. In the presence of arsenic, PML is sequestered in the nucleus, and the efficiency of HIV-mediated transduction is markedly increased.

PML appears to be involved in multiple functions, including apoptosis and transcriptional activation by RAR, whereas PML-RARalpha blocks these functions of PML. However, the mechanisms of leukemogenesis by PML-RARalpha remain elusive. Here we show that PML interacts with multiple corepressors (c-Ski, N-CoR, and mSin3A) and histone deacetylase 1, and that this interaction is required for transcriptional repression mediated by the tumor suppressor Mad. PML-RARalpha has the two corepressor-interacting sites and inhibits Mad-mediated repression, suggesting that aberrant binding of PML-RARalpha to the corepressor complexes may lead to abrogation of the corepressor function.

METHODS: Observations were carried out in the same 21 patients with ALL before the beginning of chemotherapy, after Protocol I and after Protocol M of the antileukemic treatment carried out according to the program BFM 86. RESULTS: The applied chemotherapy inhibited phenazone elimination. Both phenazone half-life and metabolic clearance rate were significantly different in patients after treatment with anticancer drugs, especially with high-dose of methotrexate (MTX), from those in patients before the beginning of chemotherapy (p < 0.001). Moreover, after MTX administration transaminases activity and serum bilirubin concentration were significantly higher than before treatment (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, anticancer chemotherapy decreased liver metabolic capacity. Particularly, high-dose methotrexate treatment altered the elimination of phenazone by inhibiting the activity of hepatic mixed function oxidase system. This change may lead to an increase in toxicity of active drugs which are metabolized by this enzyme system. In addition, altered activity of liver metabolic function can impair transformation of prodrugs to active forms. It should be considered in selection of individual drug dosages. The objective estimation of the type and degree of liver dysfunction can only be achieved by the combination of a quantitative phenazone dynamic test and static biochemical tests.","['Wiela-Hojenska, A', 'Gorczynska, E', 'Orzechowska-Juzwenko, K', 'Golebiowski, W', 'Hurkacz, M', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska, J']","['Wiela-Hojenska A', 'Gorczynska E', 'Orzechowska-Juzwenko K', 'Golebiowski W', 'Hurkacz M', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska J']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'T3CHA1B51H (Antipyrine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antipyrine/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2001/06/30 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/06/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/30 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2001 Jun;39(6):246-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 10% of AT homozygotes develop cancer, mostly of the lymphoid system. Lymphoid malignancies in patients with AT are of both B cell and T cell origin, and include Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and several forms of leukaemia. The AT locus was mapped to the chromosomal region 11q22-23 using genetic linkage analysis in the late 1980s and the causative gene was identified by positional cloning several years later. The ATM gene encodes a large protein that belongs to a family of kinases possessing a highly conserved C-terminal kinase domain related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain. Members of this kinase family have been shown to function in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control following DNA damage. Recent studies indicate that ATM is activated primarily in response to double strand breaks and may be considered a caretaker of the genome. Most mutations in ATM result in truncation and destabilisation of the protein, but certain missense and splicing errors have been shown to produce a less severe phenotype. AT heterozygotes have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Atm deficient mice exhibit many of the symptoms found in patients with AT and have a high frequency of thymic lymphoma. The association between mutation of the ATM gene and a high incidence of lymphoid malignancy in patients with AT, together with the development of lymphoma in Atm deficient mice, supports the proposal that inactivation of the ATM gene may be of importance in the pathogenesis of sporadic lymphoid malignancy. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q22-23 (the location of the ATM gene) is a common event in lymphoid malignancy. Frequent inactivating mutations of the ATM gene have been reported in patients with rare sporadic T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), and most recently, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in AT, the most frequent nucleotide changes in these sporadic lymphoid malignancies were missense mutations. The presence of inactivating mutations, together with the deletion of the normal copy of the ATM gene in some patients with T-PLL, B-CLL, and MCL, establishes somatic inactivation of the ATM gene in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies, and strongly suggests that ATM functions as a tumour suppressor. The presence of missense mutations in the germline of patients with B-CLL has been reported, suggesting that some patients with B-CLL may be constitutional AT heterozygotes. The putative hereditary predisposition of B-CLL, although intriguing, warrants further investigation.","['Boultwood, J']",['Boultwood J'],"['Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. jboultwo@enterprise.mol.biol.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/06/29 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/06/29 10:00'],"['2001/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.54.7.512 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2001 Jul;54(7):512-6. doi: 10.1136/jcp.54.7.512.,PMC1731462,,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of bench top flow cytometers has meant that immunophenotyping is now also used for the quantitation of CD34(+) peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) to ensure the correct timing and adequacy of haematopoietic progenitor cell harvests. Furthermore, flow cytometry has become an important tool for the counting of leucocytes in blood components after leucocyte depletion. Because this new discipline is now such a major diagnostic and prognostic tool in the clinical arena, its use must be subject to both internal and external quality control. Such a requirement was first recognised as early as 1986 when an Inter-Regional Quality Assessment Scheme (IRQAS) was initiated for laboratories that undertook the immunocytochemical diagnosis of leukaemia using the alkaline phosphates anti-alkaline phosphatase technique. This programme began with around 25 UK laboratories. In 1990, after the introduction of two more programmes (one for leukaemia diagnosis using UV microscopy and latterly flow cytometry, and one for the enumeration of CD4(+) T cells) the IRQAS achieved UK National External Quality Assessment Scheme (UK NEQAS) status and changed its title to UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping. In the past decade the once small IRQAS programme has evolved into the largest international scheme of its kind, providing EQA to over 650 laboratories world wide for leukaemia immunophenotyping, lymphocyte subset analysis, PBSCs, and more recently low level leucocyte counting. Over the years, this EQA programme has highlighted important problems, such as the inappropriate use of fluorochromes and antibody titre, and the identification of effective gating strategies, all of which have contributed directly to the high interlaboratory variations seen in cellular immunophenotyping. Furthermore, particularly in absolute counting of lymphocyte subsets, PBSCs, and the enumeration of low numbers of leucocytes, UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping programmes have been instrumental in highlighting the differences that occur between single and dual platform flow cytometric technologies. As a result of these findings, UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping has helped to reduce the variation seen on an interlaboratory basis and enabled greater standardisation both in the UK and internationally. These advances have been attributable to the development, by UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping, of a unique whole blood stabilising process that ensures the retention of the physical characteristics (both light scatter and antigenic profile) required of cells to ensure successful cellular immunophenotyping.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The medical records of 145 patients with pathologic Stage I or II supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin's disease treated with mantle irradiation alone between June 1967 and June 1991 were reviewed. Patterns of failure, overall survival (OS) rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify adverse prognostic factors for OS and PFS. The number of adverse prognostic factors per patient was counted, and a prognostic score was assigned to each patient. The log-rank test was used to compare the OS or PFS rates among patients with prognostic scores 0, 1, and 2. RESULTS: The median patient age was 27 years (range 10-66), with almost even male to female distribution. Every patient had splenectomy and negative laparotomy (LAP). Fifty-one patients had Stage I disease (IA-49, IB-2) and 94 Stage II (IIA-89, IIB-5). The histologic subtypes were nodular sclerosing in 110, mixed cellularity in 28, lymphocyte predominance in 5, lymphocyte depleted in 1, and unclassified in 1. Twelve patients with Stage II disease had >/= 3 sites of nodal involvement. Fifty-four patients had a prognostic score of 0, 70 of 1, and 21 of 2. The median follow-up time for the 109 surviving patients was 146 months (range 25-381). The 10- and 20-year actuarial OS rates for the whole group were 87.6% and 65.3%, respectively. The corresponding actuarial PFS rates were 75.3% and 74.2%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (9 Stage I, 27 Stage II) had relapses in a total of 41 sites. Failures by histology were 29 patients with nodular sclerosing, 6 with mixed cellularity, and 1 with lymphocyte predominance. Failures by sites were: trans-diaphragmatic, 22 (para-aortic nodes, 15; as the only site of progression in 12; visceral, 7; as the only site of progression in 5); within radiation field, 8; marginal miss, 8 (as the only site of failure in 2); and unknown, 3. The majority of the failures occurred within 5 years of diagnosis. Long-term side effects of radiation included cardiac complications in 30 patients, with 10- and 20-year actuarial cardiac complication rates of 12.6% and 35.1%, respectively; secondary solid tumors in 14, with 10- and 20-year actuarial rates of 2.3% and 25.7%, respectively; leukemia in 4; non- Hodgkin's lymphoma in 4, with the 10- and 20-year actuarial rates for leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of 4.0% and 13.9%; and hypothyroidism in 38. Four adverse prognostic factors were identified for PFS: age > or = 40 years, > or = 3 sites of involvement, male sex, and constitutional symptoms. The prognostic score correlated with patients' outcome as indicated by PFS and OS rates. Patients with a prognostic score of 0 did significantly better than those with a score of 1 or 2. CONCLUSION: In this select group of patients with pathologic Stage I and II Hodgkin's disease treated with mantle irradiation alone, the OS and PFS rates at 10 and 20 years were comparable to those reported in the literature. The major pattern of disease progression was relapse below the diaphragm, therefore close surveillance of the abdomen is warranted. The prognostic score used in our series may predict the patient's outcome, and might be worth testing in a prospective trial. In our series, patients with a prognostic score of 0 had excellent long-term survival, indicating adequate treatment with mantle irradiation alone. Late complications of the treatment pose a significant threat for the patient's survival with long-term follow-up.","['Liao, Z', 'Ha, C S', 'Vlachaki, M T', 'Hagemeister, F', 'Cabanillas, F', 'Hess, M', 'Tucker, S', 'Cox, J D']","['Liao Z', 'Ha CS', 'Vlachaki MT', 'Hagemeister F', 'Cabanillas F', 'Hess M', 'Tucker S', 'Cox JD']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas M.

We investigated the effect of HUFA-PL on differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cells induced by dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP). HUFA-containing phosphatidylethanolamine (HUFA-PE), such as salmon testis PE, significantly enhanced dbcAMP-induced cell differentiation. A combined treatment of 200 mM dbcAMP with 50 mM HUFA-PE increased the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activity, which is an indicator of differentiation, to a level comparable to that in the case of 500 mM dbcAMP treatment. In contrast, HUFA-lyso PE (a monoacyl form) did not exert an enhancing effect on dbcAMP-induced differentiation. The enhancing effect of HUFA-PE was suppressed by a protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, while a protein kinase A inhibitor, H-8, did not suppress the enhancing effect. These findings suggest that HUFA-PE might enhance dbcAMP-induced differentiation through modulation of the protein kinase C signaling pathway in HL-60 cells.","['Hosokawa, M', 'Sato, A', 'Ishigamori, H', 'Kohno, H', 'Tanaka, T', 'Takahashi, K']","['Hosokawa M', 'Sato A', 'Ishigamori H', 'Kohno H', 'Tanaka T', 'Takahashi K']","['Graduate School of Fisheries Sciences, Hokkaido University, Hakodate, Hokkaido 041-8611, Japan. hoso@fish.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '84478-11-5 (N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bucladesine/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Salmon', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/29 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/06/29 10:00'],"['2001/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01146.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2001 Jun;92(6):666-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01146.x.,PMC5926757,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations or rearrangements in several B-box family members are associated with human diseases and cancers such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Optiz/BBB syndrome, acute promyelocytic leukemia, mulibrey nanism, and thyroid carcinomas.

The trans-platinum complex trans-[PtCl(PyAc-N,O)(NH3)] (2) (N-donors are trans) and its isomer cis-[PtCl(PyAc-N,O)(NH3)] (4) (N trans to Cl) were prepared from trans-[PtCl2((NH3)(PyAcH)].H2O (1.H2O) and cis-[PtCl2(NH3)(PyAcMe) (3), respectively, employing the bidentate ligand as its methylester (PyAcMe). 2 and 4 are readily formed from the respective dichloro species, even at low pH and in the presence of extra chloride, indicating a high thermodynamic stability of the PyAc chelate ring. 1.H2O and 2-4 were characterized by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopy and elemental analyses. The solid-state structure of 2 was determined: triclinic, P1 (no. 2), with a = 8.170(2) A, b = 9.274(3) A, c = 7.374(2) A, alpha = 108.68(2) degrees, beta = 113.27(2) degrees, gamma = 74.40(2) degrees, V = 479.7(6) A3, Z = 2. The six-membered metallacyclus in 2 adopts a ""boat"" form, allowing a strainless coordination of platinum. The most promising cytotoxic properties in the above series of compounds have been established for 2 (and 1, which rapidly transforms into 2 at 37 degrees C and neutral pH). Preliminary ID50 values were 0.88 and 1.26 microM, respectively, in cisplatin-sensitive L1210 leukemia. Both compounds proved to be cross-resistant to the clinical drug. Reactions of 2 and 4 with 5'-guanosine monophosphate (5'-GMP) under physiological conditions gave the monofunctional adducts trans- and cis-[Pt(5'-GMP-N7)(PyAc-N,O)(NH3)] (I and II). Chelate-bound carboxylate was not replaced by guanine-N7 when an excess of nucleotide was applied (NMR). In an analogous reaction, 2 reacts with the oligonucleotide d(TCGT) [5'-T(1)-C(2)-G(3)-T(4)-3'] to give the adduct d(TCGT)-N7(3)-Pt(PyAc-O,N)(NH3) (III), which was characterized by a combination of total correlation spectroscopy, double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy, nuclear Overhauser effect spectrometry, and rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments. Binding of the [Pt(PyAc-N,O)(NH3)]+ fragment to N7 of G(3) causes an increase of N-type character of the T(4) and G(3) deoxyribose residues relative to the unplatinated sequence, while those of T(1) and C(2) remain S-type. An internucleotide nuclear Overhauser effect between H6(4) and H2'(3) indicates stacking between guanine and the 3'-thymine base. The most striking feature proved to be the pronounced upfield shift and broadening of the 1H NMR signals assigned to the base protons H5 and H6 in III.

The condition is generally associated with lymphoma or chronic lymphoid leukemia. Lesions are often misleading, masquerading as polymorphous erythema or lichen. We report a case of paraneoplastic pemphigus with pustulous skin lesions. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old man developed over a few weeks time erosive lesions of the oral cavity and lips associated with papulous skin lesions. Secondarily, large-sized pustules, sometimes a hypopion, were observed associated with bullae. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence that evidenced IgG deposits within the keratinocytes and along the basal membrane and by indirect immunofluorescence on rat bladder that evidenced circulating antibodies. This paraneoplastic pemphigus was the inaugural sign of chronic lymphoid leukemia. DISCUSSION: Skin lesions described in paraneoplastic pemphigus include: erosion, vesicles, bullae, and psoriasiform, lichen-like, plate-like or vegetative formations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pustulous form; clinically similar to Hallopeau pustulous pemphigus.","['Rivollier, C', 'Vaillant, L', 'Machet, M C', 'Martin, L', 'Jan, V', 'Huttenberger, B', 'Joly, P', 'Lorette, G']","['Rivollier C', 'Vaillant L', 'Machet MC', 'Martin L', 'Jan V', 'Huttenberger B', 'Joly P', 'Lorette G']","['Service de Dermatologie, CHU Trousseau, 37044 Tours Cedex.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*etiology/*pathology', 'Pemphigus/drug therapy/*etiology/*pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Skin Diseases, Bacterial/drug therapy/*etiology/*pathology']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['57711 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2001 May;128(5):644-8.,,,,,,Pemphigus paraneoplasique.

The differentiation of HL-60 cells allowed the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and p44/p42 to be rapidly and transiently activated upon stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Western blot analysis using phosphospecific p38 and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies showed that increasing concentrations of ethanol or 1-butanol but not 2-butanol (0.05-0.5%) inhibited fMLP-induced p38 activation but did not inhibit p44/p42 activation. These data indicated that activation of phospholipase D (PLD) was required for activation of p38 but not p44/p42. We compared the effect of fMLP with those of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We found that ethanol did not inhibit p38 phosphorylation upon stimulation with either GM-CSF or TNF alpha. These results suggested that in cells stimulated with fMLP, PLD was upstream of p38. To further test the involvement of PLD, we used antisense inhibition of human PLD1 expression. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides inhibited p38 but not p44/p42 phosphorylation. These data supported a role for human PLD1 in fMLP-induced p38 activation in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. In addition, the results obtained with TNF alpha and GM-CSF demonstrated that p38 activation occurred independently of PLD activation.","['Bechoua, S', 'Daniel, L W']","['Bechoua S', 'Daniel LW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157-1016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M101265200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)31477-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 24;276(34):31752-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M101265200.

These methods generally provide information about methylation of only a few CpG dinucleotides within the target sequence. METHODS: An in-tube methylation assay is described that integrates amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA and melting analysis by using a thermal cycler coupled to a fluorometer (LightCycler). DNA melting curves were acquired by measuring the fluorescence of a double-stranded DNA-binding dye (SYBR Green I) during a linear temperature transition. RESULTS: Analysis of a region comprising 11 CpG sites at the SNRPN promoter CpG island showed that the melting temperature (T(m)) differed by approximately 3 degrees C between unmethylated and fully methylated alleles. This assay could easily distinguish patients with Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome from individuals without these conditions. Melting curve analysis also allowed resolution of methylation ""mosaicism"" at the p15(Ink4b) promoter in bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML samples representing pools of heterogeneously methylated p15(Ink4b) alleles showed broadened melting peaks with overall T(m)s between those of the unmethylated and fully methylated alleles.

METHODS: Three groups of women scheduled for surgery were included in the survey: 13 bearing malignant tumors, 9 with benign ovarian tumors, and 13 without ovarian tumor who were scheduled to undergo oophorectomy due to malignant disease of the uterine cervix or endometrium. On the day prior to surgery they were injected with LDE labeled with [(14)C]cholesteryl oleate. Specimens of tumors and normal ovaries excised during surgery were lipid extracted and analyzed for radioactivity counting. Results were expressed in radioactive count (cpm) per gram of tissue. RESULTS: The mean of the uptakes of the emulsion radioactivity by the malignant tumors was roughly eightfold greater when compared with that of the contralateral normal ovaries (2261 +/- 1444 and 275 +/- 137 cpm/g, respectively, P < 0.012), benign tumors, and normal ovaries of the patients without ovarian tumors.

Alisol B acetate, a triterpene from Alisma Plantago-aquatica, has a glucocorticoid-like structure, and may have a similar function like glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in both vascular smooth muscle cell line (A7r5) and human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CEM cells). For exploring its mechanism, mitochondria membrane potential and apoptosis-related gene expression were discussed. Alisol B (10(-6)-10(-4) M) inhibited serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50) = 4.0 +/- 0.8 x 10(-6) M in A7r5 and 2.1 +/- 1.2 x 10(-6) M in CEM cells). The cell viability was reduced at 10(-4) M of alisol B. Similar results were seen in dexamethasone treatment (a synthetic glucocorticoid, 10(-6) M, 48 h). Apoptosis was induced after the cells were exposed to 10(-5)-10(-4) M alisol B or 10(-6) M dexamethasone for 48 h. The mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(m)) was significantly reduced after the alisol B treatment, indicating that the mitochondria might play a role in the alisol B induced cell apoptosis. Alisol B (10(-5)-10(-4) M) increased the levels of c-myc and bax mRNA and proteins, but not on the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene, bcl-2, in A7r5 and CEM cells. In contrast, dexamethasone (10(-6) M) treatment only caused significant increase in c-myc mRNA levels. These results suggest that the increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential might be involved in the mechanisms of alisol B-induced cell apoptosis.","['Chen, H W', 'Hsu, M J', 'Chien, C T', 'Huang, H C']","['Chen HW', 'Hsu MJ', 'Chien CT', 'Huang HC']","['Office for Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cholestenones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (alisol B monoacetate)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholestenones/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(01)00983-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(01)00983-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2001 May 11;419(2-3):127-38. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(01)00983-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median survival was 15 months for responding pts (OR plus PR) and 4.5 months for non-responders (NR plus PD). PS and pain improved in 15 pts and did not change in 9. The most frequent side effects were cytopenias, with one drug related infective death. The OPPEBVCAD regimen proved to be an effective therapy for refractory relapsing or primary resistant MM: in responders (two-thirds of the pts), survival was prolonged by about 10 months. Its efficacy in anthracycline-treated pts, as well as the feasibility of using it on an outpatient basis without any continuous drug infusions, make this regimen a promising third line salvage therapy.","['Colombi, M', 'Guffanti, A', 'Alietti, A', 'Latargia, M L', 'Vener, C', 'Maiolo, A T', 'Baldini, L']","['Colombi M', 'Guffanti A', 'Alietti A', 'Latargia ML', 'Vener C', 'Maiolo AT', 'Baldini L']","['Servizio di Ematologia, Istituto di Scienze Mediche, Universita di Milano, Ospedale Maggiore, I.R.C.C.S., Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CAD protocol 1', 'EBV protocol', 'OPP protocol', 'OPP-EBV-CAD regimen']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/chemically induced', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cause of Death', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epirubicin/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Vindesine/*administration & dosage/toxicity']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009054884 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Dec;40(1-2):87-94. doi: 10.3109/10428190009054884.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinicopathological features of these cases were analyzed to determine the influence of age, secondary karyotype abnormalities, and expression of the lymphoid marker CD19 on event free survival, and presence of extramedullary leukemia on overall survival. They were treated with a variety of chemotherapy protocols and some had bone marrow transplantation. There appeared to be no difference in survival between children (age <17 years) and adults (age >16 years). Out of the 50 cases, 16 (32%) had the (8;21) translocation alone, 17 (34%) had additional loss of a sex chromosome and the remaining 17 (34%) had other karyotype abnormalities of which deletion or translocation of the long arms of a #9 was most common (observed in 8 of the 17 patients). The karyotype groups had a significant impact on survival, the group with loss of a sex chromosome having a poorer outcome and the group with abnormalities of chromosome 9 having a better outcome. CD19 positivity was seen in 21 of the 33 cases (63%) in whom it was measured compared to 11% observed in controls with AML without a t(8;21). CD19 status did not exert any influence on event free survival. Extramedullary leukemia (EML) occurred in 5 of the 50 cases (10%). In one patient it was observed at diagnosis but in the others it presented concurrent with bone marrow relapse. The overall survival of patients with EML was worse than that of the other patients but did not achieve statistical significance and was probably adversely affected by other factors.","['Rege, K', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Atra, A A', 'Horton, C', 'Min, T', 'Dainton, M G', 'Matutes, E', 'Durosinmi, M', 'Treleaven, J G', 'Powles, R L', 'Catovsky, D']","['Rege K', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Atra AA', 'Horton C', 'Min T', 'Dainton MG', 'Matutes E', 'Durosinmi M', 'Treleaven JG', 'Powles RL', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology & Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Trust, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009054882 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Dec;40(1-2):67-77. doi: 10.3109/10428190009054882.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK leukemia cells usually possess a single episomal form of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and therefore originate from a single EBV-infected NK cell. The NK leukemia cells lack endogenous Bcl-2 expression and are sensitive to apoptotic cell death. However, they constitutively produce interferon-gamma and maintain their survival in an autocrine fashion. The interferon-gamma released from NK leukemia cells may trigger the occurrence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis through activating macrophages/histiocytes. In the primary infection of EBV, T cells infected with the episomal form of EBV sometimes produce a high amount of interferon-gamma that may lead to the occurrence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Thus, it is important to determine the role of EBV in the increased production of interferon-gamma that occurs in EBV-infected T and NK cells to clarify the developmental mechanism of NK leukemia and its paraneoplastic hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.","['Akashi, K', 'Mizuno, S']","['Akashi K', 'Mizuno S']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, USA.

In the blast phase, more than 60% of patients show additional cytogenetic changes, e. g., double Ph, +8, i(17q). In this review, we would like to address genetic changes, including genome instability, cytogenetic changes, and telomere dynamics that relate to karyotypic instability. In the chronic phase, approximately 60% of CML patients show reduced telomere length without highly elevated telomerase activity or microsatellite alterations, indicating that telomere reduction may be linked to cell replication. Therefore, the Ph translocation might be a first event to immortalize cell proliferation. In the blast phase, 50% of CML patients have high levels of elevated telomerase activity and the same number of patients had microsatellite changes. Of note is that most patients with telomerase up-regulation in the blast phase had additional cytogenetic changes and >60% of them showed microsatellite changes at least at one locus. In contrast, most patients without telomerase activity did not show microsatellite changes. These findings may indicate that telomerase up-regulation in the blast phase of CML patients is closely associated with microsatellite changes (representative of genome instability), while blast cells in the remaining patients (30%) maintain their proliferative capability without microsatellite changes and telomerase up-regulation. This further suggests that there is also an unknown mechanism for genome stability without the process of telomerase up-regulation in some patients with CML in blast crisis.","['Ohyashiki, K', 'Iwama, H', 'Tauchi, T', 'Shimamoto, T', 'Hayashi, S', 'Ando, K', 'Kawakubo, K', 'Ohyashiki, J H']","['Ohyashiki K', 'Iwama H', 'Tauchi T', 'Shimamoto T', 'Hayashi S', 'Ando K', 'Kawakubo K', 'Ohyashiki JH']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Japan. ohyashik@rr.iij4u.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Telomere/*metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009054880 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Dec;40(1-2):49-56. doi: 10.3109/10428190009054880.,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect is thought to be associated with the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) (Chaudhary, Roninson, 1992. 1993). However, we show here that cytosine beta-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara C) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), agents that activated the MDR1 gene in the H9 T-cell leukemia line, caused different effects on PKC. Namely, TPA activated PKC whereas Ara C was without the effect. Furthermore, cell permeable ceramide, a lipid messenger known to mediate cellular effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and TPA, activated the MDR1 gene and down-regulated PKC. These results suggest that the MDR1 gene can be activated via the pathway(s) that requires PKC activity as well as via bypass of PKC. The redundancy of signaling pathways that regulate the acquisition of MDR should be taken into consideration for prevention of secondary drug resistance in hematological malignancies.","['Shtil, A A', 'Ktitorova, O V', 'Kakpakova, E S', 'Holian, O']","['Shtil AA', 'Ktitorova OV', 'Kakpakova ES', 'Holian O']","['Institute of Carcinogenesis, N.

A proliferative response to TPO was noticed in the majority of AML samples (17/19) with an average increase of S-phase cells from 7.8% +/- 1.5 to 14.5% +/- 2.1 (p=0.0006). Resulting cell cycle activation did not always correlate with expression of the c-mpl receptor, although it was coupled, in the majority of samples, by an average decrease of apoptotic cells from 13% +/- 0.7 to 8.8% +/- 1.8 (p=0.05). Clonogenic cell growth (CFU-L) was confirmed in 5/17 of the samples with a mean colony number of 21.4 +/- 9.6 x 10(5) cells plated. Conversely, effects of IL-11 on AML cells demonstrated that cell cycle changes (recruitment from G0 to S phase) were promoted only in a minority of samples (2/14) and there was little, if any, effect on CFU-L growth (mean colony number=17.5 +/- 9.5) or Apo (from 13% +/- 0.7 to 13.3 +/- 1.9). Combination of TPO with IL-11 induced a slight increase of clonogenic cell growth, while the addition of IL-3 or SCF to the c-mpl ligand significantly raised the mean colony numbers up to 119.2 +/- 68.3 and 52.9 +/- 22.1 x 10(5) cells plated, respectively. In summary, TPO shows activity on AML cells by stimulating their proliferation in a significant proportion of cases and generally protecting the majority of AML blast cells from induction of Apo. Conversely, IL-11 exerts little effect on the cell cycle activation and Apo. These data help to understand regulation of myeloid leukemia cell growth and should be considered in the clinical use of early-acting megakaryocyte growth factors in acute leukemia.","['Petrucci, M T', 'Ricciardi, M R', 'Gregorj, C', 'Ariola, C', 'Mazzola, F', 'Fogli, M', 'Lemoli, R M', 'Tafuri, A']","['Petrucci MT', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Gregorj C', 'Ariola C', 'Mazzola F', 'Fogli M', 'Lemoli RM', 'Tafuri A']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza di Roma, Italia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009054895 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Dec;40(1-2):179-90. doi: 10.3109/10428190009054895.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, induced a retinoic acid-like differentiation response followed by extensive apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines at relatively low concentrations (<20 microM) of this agent. More recently, we demonstrated that acute myeloid leukemias but not acute lymphocytic leukemias also displayed increased sensitivity to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. In this study, we examined the ability of lovastatin to induce differentiation of acute myeloid leukemic cells and to evaluate the role differentiation may hold in the anti-leukemic properties of this agent. Increased expression of the leukocyte integrins CD11b and CD18 as well as down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 are associated with late stage differentiation of the myeloid lineage and retinoic acid induced maturation of acute myeloid leukemic cells. Lovastatin exposure induced increased expression of CD11b and CD18 markers similar to retinoic acid treatment. Following 24 hrs exposure to 20 microM lovastatin, all 7 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines tested showed a decrease in bcl-2 mRNA expression while only 1/5 acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines showed a similar response. A role for bcl-2 in the apoptotic response of acute myeloid leukemia cells to lovastatin was demonstrated as exogenous constitutive expression of bcl-2 in the AML-5 cell line inhibited apoptosis in a time and dose dependent manner. Thus, lovastatin exposure of acute myeloid leukemia cells induced a differentiation response that may contribute to the therapeutic potential of this agent in the treatment of this disease.","['Dimitroulakos, J', 'Thai, S', 'Wasfy, G H', 'Hedley, D W', 'Minden, M D', 'Penn, L Z']","['Dimitroulakos J', 'Thai S', 'Wasfy GH', 'Hedley DW', 'Minden MD', 'Penn LZ']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'CD18 Antigens/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009054894 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Dec;40(1-2):167-78. doi: 10.3109/10428190009054894.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While in some experiments the BTK stimulation was transient, in others the BTK activity continued to be significantly elevated for up to 4 hours. Similarly, exposure of NALM-6 cells to EMF resulted in activation of BTK within 30 minutes in 7 of 7 experiments with stimulation indexes ranging from 1.2 to 7.4. Stimulation of BTK activity in EMF exposed cells was associated with enhanced phosphoinositide turnover and increased inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production in 7 of 13 experiments with DT40 cells and 7 of 13 experiments with NALM-6 cells. The likelihood and magnitude of an IP3 response after EMF exposure were similar to those after BCR ligation on DT40 cells and CD19 ligation on NALM-6 cells.

The treatment protocol provided r-HuEPO in a dose of 150 U/kg s.c. thrice weekly for 3 mo. After 1.5 mo of r-HuEPO administration, if response was not satisfactory, r-HuEPO dose escalation was utilised by giving incremental doses of 50 U/kg more than the previous dose up to a maximum dose of 300 U/kg tiw. After maximal response, half of the responding patients discontinued therapy, while the other half received maintenance therapy at a dose of 150 U/kg s.c./w. Oral iron was given throughout the study. Pretreatment EPO levels were determined in all patients. A complete response (CR) was defined when Ht was >38% and a partial response (PR) when there was an increase of the Ht >6% from the initial value was achieved. Sixteen of the 22 B-CLL patients had Rai stage III disease and 6 stage IV, with a median duration of anaemia 27 months (6-38); twelve of them were receiving chlorambucil while the rest were on no treatment. Of the SLL and LPL group, 4 patients had Ann Arbor stage III disease and 7 stage IV with a median duration of anaemia 24 months (5-36); 8 patients were on chlorambucil. Complete response was achieved in 50% of the B-CLL group and 54% of the SLL and LPL group, with an overall response rate of 77% and 81% respectively. All patients on maintenance therapy had a continuous response, while all patients, in whom rHuEPO was discontinued, relapsed. No correlation was found between patients: with low or high pretreatment serum EPO levels; those receiving concomitant therapy or not; those with B-symptoms or not; those with a non-diffuse or diffuse bone marrow infiltration pattern; and with splenomegaly or not. Life quality was significantly improved and no major side effects were encountered. We conclude from our study that r-HuEPO is very effective in correcting disease-related anaemia in B-CLD, resulting in down-staging of Rai stage III patients and that maintenance therapy is necessary. Whether the correction of anaemia improves patients' overall survival, still remains to be seen.","['Siakantaris, M P', 'Angelopoulou, M K', 'Vassilakopoulos, T P', 'Dimopoulou, M N', 'Kontopidou, F N', 'Pangalis, G A']","['Siakantaris MP', 'Angelopoulou MK', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Dimopoulou MN', 'Kontopidou FN', 'Pangalis GA']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University, School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/etiology/*therapy', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/complications', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*blood/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009054891 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Dec;40(1-2):141-7. doi: 10.3109/10428190009054891.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies indicate that liganded PPARgamma not only promotes differentiation but also inhibits the activation of macrophages. Osteopontin, a component of extracellular matrix, is synthesized by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. In this study, we examined whether PPARgamma ligand regulates osteopontin gene expression in THP-1 cells, a cell line derived from human monocytic leukemia cells which can differentiate to macrophage upon stimulation with phorbol ester PMA. Northern blot analysis showed that osteopontin expression is markedly induced in response to PMA. Troglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand, dramatically attenuated the PMA-induced osteopontin expression. Transient transfection assays of the human osteopontin promoter/luciferase construct which contains a 5'-flanking region between -1500 and +87 relative to the transcription start site demonstrate that either treatment with troglitazone or cotransfection of PPARgamma expression vector inhibits osteopontin promoter activity. These data indicate that troglitazone reduces osteopontin gene expression at transcriptional level through PPARgamma activation, and suggest the role of troglitazone in inhibiting the ability of macrophages to produce extracellular matrix, which is particularly relevant to atherosclerotic plaque formation.","['Oyama, Y', 'Kurabayashi, M', 'Akuzawa, N', 'Nagai, R']","['Oyama Y', 'Kurabayashi M', 'Akuzawa N', 'Nagai R']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Congress'],Japan,J Atheroscler Thromb,Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis,9506298,"['0 (Chromans)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromans/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Osteopontin', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Troglitazone']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.5551/jat1994.7.77 [doi]'],ppublish,J Atheroscler Thromb. 2000;7(2):77-82. doi: 10.5551/jat1994.7.77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most chemotherapeutic agents are cytotoxic by inducing apoptosis. We examined the apoptotic activity of GLA on purified B-cells isolated from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and from normal individuals. GLA significantly increased the degree of apoptosis in B-CLL B-cells after 24 hours of culture. The mean percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis when cultured in medium alone (spontaneous apoptosis) was 20% (range: 7 to 31%) (n=25) and in the presence of GLA (5 microg-60 microg) was: 42%-95%. In the presence of GLA 5 microg/ml and dexamethasone the degree of apoptosis was 86% (range: 72 to 100%). GLA induced apoptosis in B-CLL B-cells at a higher level than that observed with normal B-cells at all lower concentrations tested 5, 10 and 15 microg/ml: P=0.045; 0.027 and 0.022, respectively. At 30 microg/ml of GLA, no significant difference in the percentage of cells displaying apoptosis between B-CLL and normal B-cells was observed (P=0.075). GLA induced apoptosis in B-CLL T-cells at both 10 and 30 microg/ml. The degree of apoptosis in normal T-cells with GLA was also significant at the higher concentration of 30 microg/ml. Interleukin 4 (IL4), a viability factor in B-CLL, and vitamin E, an anti-oxidant, protected B-CLL B-cells against GLA (20 microg/ml)-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that GLA induces apoptosis in B-CLL B- and T-cells cells in vitro and that they are more susceptible to GLA-induced apoptosis than normal peripheral blood B- and T-cells.","['Mainou-Fowler, T', 'Proctor, S J', 'Dickinson, A M']","['Mainou-Fowler T', 'Proctor SJ', 'Dickinson AM']","['University Department of Haematology, School of Clinical, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '78YC2MAX4O (gamma-Linolenic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/immunology/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid/*pharmacology']",2001/06/28 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109057939 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jan;40(3-4):393-403. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057939.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty three PICCs were inserted during severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50 x 10(9)/L), and 31 during severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 10(9)/L). Mean catheter duration was 82 (median 63, range 3-441) days for a total of 4274 catheter days. A mean of 1.8 chemotherapy courses were administered via each PICC. There were 5 early complications of PICC placement. Other mechanical complications occurred in 14 catheters and phlebitis in 12. Twenty blood stream infections (BSI) occurred in 17 patients. All BSIs occurred during neutropenia. Seventeen PICCs were removed due to the following complications - phlebitis (11), possible catheter related BSI (4), mechanical reasons in 3 (2 with concomitant phlebitis) and persistent fever (1). PICC duration was significantly shorter in these 17 catheters (52.9 v 96.4 days in the other 35, p=0.0289). We conclude that PICCs provide long-term vascular access with an acceptable complication rate in patients with AML.

However, the precise mechanism of HTLV-I oncogenesis is unclear. HTLV-I Tax protein functions as an activator of various cellular genes, including IL-2, IL-2 receptor-alpha, and c-fos through the activation of nuclear transfer factors such as NF-kappaB and SRF, and also potently activates trascription of viral genes through CREB/ATF sites in the viral LTR. However, Tax activation of HTLV-I infected T cells through the above pathways induces polyclonal proliferation of the cells in vitro; Tax however may function only transiently in the immediate post-infection period following infection in vivo. The long latent period of 60 years from infection to onset of disease suggests other mechanisms for ATL oncogenesis. Recent studies suggest that the malignant transformation of ATL is a multi-hit phenomena, suggesting that discrete genetic events are responsible for ATL oncogenesis. These genetic events could be responsible for the different stages of ATL: smoldering, chronic, lymphoma, and acute type, p16 and p53 genes are important negative regulators of the cell cycle and are often found to be mutated in neoplasms. Recent studies including ours demonstrated a high frequency of alteration of these two genes in primary ATL cells. Furthermore, alteration of the two genes is associated with acute but not chronic type ATL. In addition, p16 gene alteration is linked to the growth rate of ATL cells, suggesting that the alteration of these cell cycle regulatory genes may be related to progression from smoldering or chronic to acute or lymphoma type ATL. Tax may be involved in mutagenesis of these genes through suppression of DNA-beta polymerase gene expression during the process from latent period to acute/lymphoma type. Once transformation occurs, activation of the pathway between Tax and the three nuclear transfer factors, NF-kappaB, SRF, and CREB/ATF, contributes to establish the aggressive manifestations of acute/lymphoma type ATL cells.","['Arima, N', 'Tei, C']","['Arima N', 'Tei C']","['First Department Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan. nao@med6.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/pathology']",2001/06/28 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109057925 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jan;40(3-4):267-78. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057925.,,,,,137,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the aberrations, such as translocations and deletions, often harbor a breakpoint at 11q23, which suggests that this region might contain a tumor suppressor gene important for the genesis of lymphoproliferative disorders. Interestingly, deletions are concentrated only in some subtypes of hematological malignancies, where they are detected at a relatively high frequency. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), deletions have been detected in 20-30% of the cases, whereas almost half of the mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) show deletion at 11q23 in fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), deletions involving the region 11q23.3-23.1 have also been detected to be frequent. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 11q deletion is associated with more rapid disease progression and poor survival in a younger subgroup of patients. The putative tumor suppressor genes have remained unrevealed until recently, when the ATM gene was found to carry mutations in cases with deletion in B-CLL, MCL and T-PLL. These data suggest that 11q deletions and dysfunction of the ATM gene might have significance in the tumorigenesis of certain subsets of hematological malignancies. Importance of 11q deletion as a diagnostic marker needs to be further studied in a larger series of patients. Another issue that remains to be investigated is the involvement of other target genes in the deletion.","['Monni, O', 'Knuutila, S']","['Monni O', 'Knuutila S']","['Cancer Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda 20892, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics']",2001/06/28 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109057924 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jan;40(3-4):259-66. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057924.,,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and other have now reported that the leukemic cells spontaneously display the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, iNOS. Inhibition of the iNOS pathway leads to increased apoptosis of the tumoral cells in vitro, indicating that the endogenous release of NO contributes to their resistance to the normal apoptotic process. The factors that induce the expression of iNOS in vivo in the leukemic cells are not yet identified. Yet, as interaction of B-CLL leukemic cells with bone marrow stromal cells promotes their survival, the involvement of adhesion molecules and integrins may be suspected. The engagement of CD23 stimulates iNOS activation in the tumoral cells, suggesting that in vivo interaction of CD23 with one of its recognised ligands may contribute to iNOS induction. A role for CD40-CD40 ligand interaction may also be hypothesised. The mechanisms involved in the anti-apoptotic role of NO are not fully understood, but may implicate the inhibition of caspase activity, hence the impairment of the Fas pathway. In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential disruption appears to be a NO-sensitive step in the apoptosis cascade. The presence of a NOS displaying anti-apoptotic properties has now been recognised in different cell types, including various leukaemia. A better knowledge of the mechanisms governing the ultimate fate of NO, anti- versus pro-apoptotic would allow the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these diseases.","['Kolb, J P', 'Roman, V', 'Mentz, F', 'Zhao, H', 'Rouillard, D', 'Dugas, N', 'Dugas, B', 'Sigaux, F']","['Kolb JP', 'Roman V', 'Mentz F', 'Zhao H', 'Rouillard D', 'Dugas N', 'Dugas B', 'Sigaux F']","['U365 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France. jpkolb@curie.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/etiology/pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/pharmacology/physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II']",2001/06/28 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109057923 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jan;40(3-4):243-57. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057923.,,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,

We did not find a significant correlation between adhesion molecule expression and well established risk factors (age, white blood cell count, central nervous system involvement, chromosomal abnormalities), with the exception of splenomegaly, that was significantly associated with CD18 expression. In the follow-up, no evidence of significant correlation between adhesive phenotype and adverse events such as leukemic relapse and death was found. In conclusion, although expression of adhesion molecules on lymphoblasts confirms the phenotypic heterogeneity of ALL, it appears that this is not relevant for the clinical aspects of the disease and for prognosis.","['Mengarelli, A', 'Zarcone, D', 'Caruso, R', 'Tenca, C', 'Rana, I', 'Pinto, R M', 'Grossi, C E', 'De Rossi, G']","['Mengarelli A', 'Zarcone D', 'Caruso R', 'Tenca C', 'Rana I', 'Pinto RM', 'Grossi CE', 'De Rossi G']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Istituto di Ricovera e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Citta del Vaticano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097660 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Feb;40(5-6):625-30. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097660.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monosomy 7, trisomy 8 and 5q- were evaluated by means of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Monosomy 7 was present in 6 pts, trisomy 8 in 5 pts, and 5q- in 6 pts. More than one aberration was seen in 7 pts. Chromosomal aberrations were mostly found in older pts (12/14 >60 years; p=0.03) and in pts with CD34 positive leukemic blasts (13/14 coexpressed CD34, p=0.0004). In 25 pts also standard G-banding analysis was performed leading to concordant results regarding chromosomes 7, 8 and 5. Flow cytometry identifyed MDR-1 positivity (MDR+) in 16 pts. MDR-1 expression appeared to be a characteristic feature in CD34+ AML (12/16 were CD34+ and MDR+ pts; p=0.013). No correlation, however, was found between chromosomal aberrations and MDR-1 expression. Pts with aberrations of either chromosomes 7, 8 or 5 detected by FISH (FISH+) were predominantly resistant to induction therapy (6/8 pts, p=0.004). A lower rate of complete remission (CR) was also seen in pts with MDR-1 expression (p=0.006). MDR+/FISH+ pts (n=3) were all refractory to remission induction, while all MDR-/FISH- pts (n=19) achieved CR (p=0.0006). MDR-1+ as well as pts with aberrations of chromosomes 7, and 5(q) showed a significantly decreased probability of overall survival. In conclusion, MDR-1 expression as well as abnormalities of chromosomes 7, and 5(q) predict poor clinical outcome in AML.

The results of the studies presented so far have shown that 2-CdA gives similar complete response (CR) rate and overall response (OR) rate to fludarabine but the influence of both agents on survival times of the patients with CLL is still uncertain. CR rate induced with 2-CdA is significantly higher than in the patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. In refractory or relapsed patients 2-CdA induces 31 to 68% of overall responses including CR in 4 to 31%. In previously untreated patients overall remission rates of about 56-82% have been achieved with 2-CdA alone. When 2-CdA was used as primary therapy the CR rate was also significantly higher and ranged from 10% to 47%. Patients who received 2-CdA as their initial therapy and experienced a response lasting at least a year may be successfully treated subsequently with the same agent. A second response has been achieved in 35 to 100% patients treated with this agent for the second time. Despite the fact that 2-CdA gives higher CR and OR rates than conventional chemotherapy, it has not been established whether it has any influence on survival time. However, cross resistance between 2-CdA and FAMP in CLL patients is evident in the majority of studies. Bone marrow suppression with anemia neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are the dose limiting factors for 2-CdA use. These side effects are pronounced in heavily pretreated patients and after multiple courses of therapy. Treatment with this agent also leads to the decrease of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio for an extensive period of time exceeding 12, even up to 24 months. In consequence, infections including opportunistic type, are frequently observed. We suggest, that in patients with CLL, 2-CdA should be used as second line treatment rather than the first line therapy until the final results of ongoing randomized clinical trials are available.","['Robak, T']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Hospital, Poland. robaktad@psk2.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097654 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Feb;40(5-6):551-64. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097654.,,,,,111,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Cox model showed that greater number of prior relapses and prior radiation therapy were significant risk factors for the development of MDS/AML. These data suggest that CBV is associated with a lower risk of secondary MDS/AML than TBI containing regimens and that much of the risk is associated with the pre-transplantation therapy. The use of autotransplantation early in the course of therapy for relapsed lymphoma might prevent some cases of MDS/AML.","['Wheeler, C', 'Khurshid, A', 'Ibrahim, J', 'Elias, A', 'Mauch, P', 'Ault, K', 'Antin, J']","['Wheeler C', 'Khurshid A', 'Ibrahim J', 'Elias A', 'Mauch P', 'Ault K', 'Antin J']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Farber Cancer Institute, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/etiology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097649 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Feb;40(5-6):499-509. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097649.,,,,['P01 CA38493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, since the first report on the apoptosis inducing activity of resveratrol in human cancer cells, the interest in this molecule as a potential chemotherapy agent has significantly intensified. Not only has its role as an anti-cancer agent been corroborated, but the precise mechanism(s) of the anti-cancer activity of resveratrol is/are being elucidated. Our group has been active in studying the cross talk between the caspase family of proteases and mitochondria, in drug-induced apoptosis. In this regard, we have shown that the cancer preventive activity of resveratrol could be attributed to its ability to trigger apoptosis in human leukemia and breast carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity of resveratrol is restricted against these transformed cell types due to its ability to selectively upregulate CD95-CD95L interaction on the tumor cell surface, unlike normal peripheral blood cells. Despite the involvement of the CD95 signaling pathway, apoptosis induced by resveratrol is not accompanied by robust caspase 8 activation, but involves mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and downstream activation of caspases 9 and 3. We also extrapolate these in vitro findings in a murine model of carcinogensis, and demonstrate in vivo induction of apoptosis in mouse skin papillomas.

Caspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases and have emerged as central regulators of the apoptotic cascade. Despite many and diverse signals that can trigger apoptosis, the execution of apoptosis appears to be uniformly mediated through activation of caspase enzymes. Inapproriate expression of caspases or malfunctions in their regulation through other pathways may also be an important step in the pathogenesis of acute leukemias. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of the inactive forms of caspases CPP32 (caspase 3) and ICH-1 (caspase 2) is frequently observed in the blasts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Many other enzymes involved in apoptosis are expressed at high levels in patients with acute leukemia. Whether this signals the capacity of leukemic cells to rapid induction of apoptosis with fast reduction of the burden of disease and favorable clinical outcome, or accumulation of inactive substrates that cannot be activated by lack of cellular mechanisms to do so, requires further investigation. With the identification of many other regulators of apoptotic activity in the leukemic cells, new targets for future therapy may be identified and many new insights can be gained in understanding the biological behavior of response and resistance to therapy as well as control and relapse from minimal residual disease.","['Faderl, S', 'Estrov, Z']","['Faderl S', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia and Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Apoptosis', '*Caspases/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/metabolism/mortality/pathology/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097646 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Feb;40(5-6):471-81. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097646.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence rates among volunteer blood donors were 0.02% and 0% for HTLV and HIV, respectively. Significantly increased HTLV prevalence rates were observed among paid blood donors, African American health care clinic patients, Amerindians, recipients of HTLV-positive cellular blood products, intravenous drug users, sexual contacts and family members of HTLV-positive people, and patients with primary thrombocytosis and other-than-low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Among some of these groups there were significant differences in the prevalence of HTLV-I versus HTLV-II. The eight HTLV-positive NHL patients all had mature, high-grade, CD4+ T-cell lymphomas with clonally integrated HTLV-I, for a prevalence of 4% among other-than-low-grade NHL patients. Seven of the eight died from their disease within 2 years despite treatment. Interestingly, two groups at risk for HTLV infection, namely needle stick victims and recipients of HTLV-infected and/or pooled plasma products, showed no evidence for infection. Significantly increased HIV-1 prevalence was observed among paid blood donors, African Americans, homosexuals, female prostitutes, hemophiliacs, and other-than-low-grade NHL patients. Only one patient was infected with HIV-2. Of the nine HIV-positive, other-than-low-grade NHL patients, seven HIV-1 positives had B-cell lymphomas, one HIV-1 positive had an HTLV-I-positive CD4+ T-cell lymphoma, and one infected with HIV-2 had a CD4+ T-cell lymphoma that was HTLV negative. The data indicate that HTLV-I lymphoma, while uncommon, is not necessarily rare among other-than-low-grade NHL cases in the United States and, given its poor prognosis, should probably be studied separately in clinical trials.","['Poiesz, B J', 'Papsidero, L D', 'Ehrlich, G', 'Sherman, M', 'Dube, S', 'Poiesz, M', 'Dillon, K', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Slamon, D', 'Fang, C', 'Williams, A', 'Duggan, D', 'Glaser, J', 'Gottlieb, A', 'Goldberg, J', 'Ratner, L', 'Phillips, P', 'Han, T', 'Friedman-Kien, A', 'Siegal, F', 'Rai, K', 'Sawitsky, A', 'Sheremata, L W', 'Dosik, H', 'Cunningham, C', 'Montagna, R']","['Poiesz BJ', 'Papsidero LD', 'Ehrlich G', 'Sherman M', 'Dube S', 'Poiesz M', 'Dillon K', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Slamon D', 'Fang C', 'Williams A', 'Duggan D', 'Glaser J', 'Gottlieb A', 'Goldberg J', 'Ratner L', 'Phillips P', 'Han T', 'Friedman-Kien A', 'Siegal F', 'Rai K', 'Sawitsky A', 'Sheremata LW', 'Dosik H', 'Cunningham C', 'Montagna R']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York Health Science Center, Syracuse, USA. poieszb@vax.cs.hscsyr.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['African Americans', 'Agammaglobulinemia/epidemiology', 'Blood Donors', 'Comorbidity', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Family Health', 'HIV Infections/epidemiology/virology', 'HIV-1/isolation & purification', 'HIV-2/isolation & purification', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology', 'HTLV-II Infections/epidemiology', 'Hemophilia A/epidemiology', 'Indians, North American', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Lymphoma/classification/epidemiology/ethnology/virology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/epidemiology/ethnology/virology', 'Needlestick Injuries/complications', 'Prevalence', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology/ethnology/virology', 'Rheumatic Diseases/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous', 'Thrombocytosis/epidemiology', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1096-8652(200101)66:1<32::AID-AJH1004>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2001 Jan;66(1):32-8. doi: 10.1002/1096-8652(200101)66:1<32::AID-AJH1004>3.0.CO;2-3.,,,,"['CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NHLBI-67021/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To stimulate CLL-specific immune responses, we sought to transfer the human CD40 ligand (hCD40L) gene to B-CLL cells, using an adenoviral vector, in order to upregulate costimulating factors on these cells. Because efficient gene transduction with adenoviral vectors requires the expression of virus receptors on target cells, including the coxsackievirus B-adenovirus receptors (CAR) and alpha(v) integrins, we cocultured B-CLL cells with human embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 line). This exposure led to increased expression of integrin alpha(v)beta3 on B-CLL cells, which correlated with higher transduction rates. Using this novel prestimulation system, we transduced B-CLL cells with the hCD40L gene. The Ad-hCD40L-infected cells had higher expression of B7 molecules and induced activation of autologous T cells in vitro, but these T cells could not recognize parental leukemic cells. By contrast, an admixture of Ad-hCD40L-positive cells and leukemic cells transduced with the human interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene produced greater T cell activation than did either immunostimulator population alone. Importantly, this combination generated autologous T cells capable of specifically recognizing parental B-CLL cells. These findings suggest that the combined use of genetically modified CD40L-expressing B-CLL cells in combination with IL-2-expressing B-CLL cells may induce therapeutically significant leukemia-specific immune responses.","['Takahashi, S', 'Rousseau, R F', 'Yotnda, P', 'Mei, Z', 'Dotti, G', 'Rill, D', 'Hurwitz, R', 'Marini, F', 'Andreeff, M', 'Brenner, M K']","['Takahashi S', 'Rousseau RF', 'Yotnda P', 'Mei Z', 'Dotti G', 'Rill D', 'Hurwitz R', 'Marini F', 'Andreeff M', 'Brenner MK']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes/*genetics']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303401300057360 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Apr 10;12(6):659-70. doi: 10.1089/104303401300057360.,,,,"['R01 CA75014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA78792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have demonstrated that adhesion in anchorage-dependent cells is mediated in vitro by adsorption of serum proteins [particularly proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin and vitronectin] present in the growth medium. Specifically, adhesion has been shown to occur when ECM proteins attach to the substratum and act as ligands for specific receptors located on the surface of cells. K562 cells are human erythroleukemic cells that normally grow in suspension. These cells are not involved in the same cell adhesion processes as anchorage-dependent cells and do not need to be attached to ECM proteins in order to survive and grow. Thus, with these systems, it is possible to better determine the role of protein adsorption in the adhesion of cells, growing in suspension such as blood cells, onto charged surfaces. The results presented show that adhesion of K562 cells onto the positively charged polylysine surface in the presence of serum is mediated through specific interactions between fibronectin receptors present on K562 cells and fibronectin adsorbed onto that cationic surface. Specifically, determination of cell adhesion under different experimental conditions indicates that nonspecific charge interactions do not take place directly between the cells and polylysine, but rather take place between polylysine and fibronectin, which adsorbs onto the cationic polymer. In addition, flow cytometric analyses reveal that only fibronectin receptors are present on these cells and, consequently, only fibronectin can be responsible for the actual adhesion of these cells onto the cationic surface. In view of the data presented, the possibility should be considered that ECM components adsorbed onto surfaces with specific charges and/or belonging to certain functional groups are involved in structural and functional modifications in cells. These cells grow in suspension and are normally not involved in adhesion phenomena, though these components should be considered. These considerations should be made especially when designing biomaterials that can modulate the response of cells growing in suspension, such as blood cells, and also in tissue engineering of blood substitutes.","['Rainaldi, G', 'Filippini, P', 'Ferrante, A', 'Indovina, P L', 'Santini, M T']","['Rainaldi G', 'Filippini P', 'Ferrante A', 'Indovina PL', 'Santini MT']","['Laboratorio di Ultrastrutture, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomed Mater Res,Journal of biomedical materials research,0112726,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Cations', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microvilli/ultrastructure', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology']",2001/06/28 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-4636(200104)55:1<104::aid-jbm140>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Mater Res. 2001 Apr;55(1):104-13. doi: 10.1002/1097-4636(200104)55:1<104::aid-jbm140>3.0.co;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In 1987--1991, 6570 IDU were tested for HIV and HTLV-II antibodies. In 1998, they were matched to the National Death Index. Numbers of observed deaths of each cause were compared by standardized mortality ratios with the numbers expected, using sex-, race-, age-, and year-specific rates in the general population. Relative risk (RR) associated with each virus, compared to uninfected drug users, was estimated by Poisson modeling. RESULTS: There were 1351 deaths, including 683 (15%) of 4604 participants who enrolled seronegative for both viruses; 328 (47%) of 701 who had HIV but not HTLV-II infection; 220 (21%) of 1033 who had HTLV-II but not HIV infection; and 120 (52%) of 232 who were infected by both viruses. Compared to the general population, mortality for participants with neither virus was increased 4.3-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0--4.7] and was significantly elevated for virtually every cause of death. With HIV, mortality from medical causes, but not external causes, was increased 3.7-fold (95% CI, 3.3--4.2), particularly with AIDS and related conditions. With HTLV-II, all-cause mortality was reduced (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7--0.9), with no statistically significant reduction or elevation for any specific cause. A non-significant excess of tuberculosis deaths (RR, 4.6; 95% CI, 0.8--25.2) was noted with HTLV-II, but there was no excess mortality from leukemia/lymphoma, other malignancies, or neurodegenerative disease. CONCLUSIONS: Without HIV or HTLV-II, IDU had profoundly increased mortality from medical and external causes. HIV was specifically associated with death due to AIDS and related conditions. HTLV-II infection was not significantly associated with mortality from any cause, suggesting that it is not a significant human pathogen, even when present with HIV infection.","['Goedert, J J', 'Fung, M W', 'Felton, S', 'Battjes, R J', 'Engels, E A']","['Goedert JJ', 'Fung MW', 'Felton S', 'Battjes RJ', 'Engels EA']","['Viral Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,,IM,"['*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'HIV Infections/epidemiology/*mortality', 'HIV Seroprevalence', 'HTLV-II Infections/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Risk Factors', '*Substance Abuse, Intravenous', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/06/27 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-200107060-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2001 Jul 6;15(10):1295-302. doi: 10.1097/00002030-200107060-00012.,,,,"['271-90-4000/PHS HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-01004/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-91027/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many endocytic proteins, including eps15, epsin1, the clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM), and alpha-adaptin, accumulate in the nucleus when nuclear export is inhibited. Endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of endocytic proteins are apparently independent processes, since inhibition of endocytosis did not appreciably alter nuclear translocation of endocytic proteins, and blockade of nuclear export did not change the initial rate of endocytosis. In the nucleus, eps15 and CALM acted as positive modulators of transcription in a GAL4-based transactivation assay, thus raising the intriguing possibility that some endocytic proteins play a direct or indirect role in transcriptional regulation.","['Vecchi, M', 'Polo, S', 'Poupon, V', 'van de Loo, J W', 'Benmerah, A', 'Di Fiore, P P']","['Vecchi M', 'Polo S', 'Poupon V', 'van de Loo JW', 'Benmerah A', 'Di Fiore PP']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EPS15 protein, human)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (epsin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', '*Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins']",2001/06/27 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.153.7.1511 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2001 Jun 25;153(7):1511-7. doi: 10.1083/jcb.153.7.1511.,PMC2150719,,,['D.090/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current paper was to report the clinical, histopathologic, and molecular biologic findings of intraocular and ocular adnexal involvement in a patient with systemic B-CLL. DESIGN: Case report. INTERVENTION: Treatment consisted of systemic chemotherapy, conjunctival biopsies, and, ultimately, enucleation of the left eye. METHODS: Histopathologic findings of a bone marrow biopsy, the conjunctival biopsies, and the enucleated eye were compared. Further, extensive immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement, gene scan analysis, and DNA sequencing were performed on all tissues. RESULTS: The tumor manifestations in all specimens demonstrated similar morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics, consistent with the diagnosis of B-CLL. Immunoglobulin-H PCR and gene scan analysis showed that the B-CLL infiltrates consisted of B cells derived from the same clone. DNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of eight somatic mutations in the variable region of IgH, consistent with ""memory"" B-CLL. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary ocular manifestations of B-CLL occur relatively commonly during disease progression. In the current case of memory B-CLL, ocular manifestation of the disease occurred 16 years after initial diagnosis, agreeing with clinical studies suggesting that a less aggressive course is seen in ""memory"" B-CLL than its counterpart, ""naive"" B-CLL. Somatic mutation analysis in the variable region of IgH in B-CLL should be part of routine staging investigations to aid the prediction of the individual clinical course in B-CLL patients and to determine new therapeutic strategies.","['Coupland, S E', 'Foss, H D', 'Bechrakis, N E', 'Hummel, M', 'Stein, H']","['Coupland SE', 'Foss HD', 'Bechrakis NE', 'Hummel M', 'Stein H']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital Benjamin Franklin, Freie Universitat, Berlin, Germany. secoupland@yahoo.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Eye Enucleation', 'Eye Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology/surgery', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/06/27 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(01)00594-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-6420(01)00594-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 2001 Jul;108(7):1289-95. doi: 10.1016/s0161-6420(01)00594-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The euclidian distance (i.e., the mean arithmetic three-dimensional [3-D] distance) between the 5' most IgH gene, C mu, and the 3' most IgH gene, C alpha, was used as the indicator to define the co-presence of a condensed IgH domain and a relaxed IgH domain in the same cell. In normal and malignant B cells in which IgH is actively rearranged and transcribed, the C mu/C alpha distance (genomic distance approximately 180 kb) was found to range from 87.5 to 121 nm on the condensed IgH domain and from 154 to 207 nm on the relaxed IgH domain. In non-B cells (fibroblasts, neutrophils, and macrophages), in which IgH is inactive, the C mu/C alpha distance was found to range from 136 to 154 nm on the condensed IgH domain and from 250 to 292 nm on the related IgH domain. These results suggested that conformational differences that may predispose the relaxed IgH domain for illegitimate genetic recombinations, such as chromosomal translocations, are likely to exist in many cell types, including B cells. However, in B lymphocytes this structural predisposition may conspire with the lineage-specific ability to activate proto-oncogenes (after juxtaposition to IgH) to positively affect the preferential involvement of the relaxed IgH domain in chromosomal translocations. Additional studies are warranted to validate this working hypothesis.","['Esa, A', 'Coleman, A E', 'Edelmann, P', 'Silva, S', 'Cremer, C G', 'Janz, S']","['Esa A', 'Coleman AE', 'Edelmann P', 'Silva S', 'Cremer CG', 'Janz S']","['Applied Optics and Information Processing, Kirchhoff Institute for Physics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'DNA/*chemistry/genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', '*Multigene Family', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/06/27 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(01)00455-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00455-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Jun;127(2):168-73. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00455-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the GTG-banding technique (G-banding) is the most commonly used diagnostic method in clinical cytogenetics. G-banding analysis of subtle chromosomal rearrangements or complex karyotypes with multiple markers can be inadequate because of poor chromosome morphology and/or an insufficient yield of analyzable metaphases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a highly sensitive and specific method to detect chromosomal alterations. Conventional FISH is used optimally in instances where only one or a few abnormalities are investigated. Spectral karyotyping (SKY), a novel cytogenetic technique, has been developed to unambiguously display and identify all chromosomes at one time using a spectrum of 24 different colors. This report presents the use of SKY for examination of the entire karyotype in specimens with complex chromosomal abnormalities from three leukemia patients. Conventional cytogenetic analysis (G-banding) showed complex hyperdiploid clones with multiple markers in each case. SKY was able to clarify and identify additional cryptic chromosomal translocations [e.g., t(2;10), t(3;10), t(5;7), t(7;18), t(9;17), t(10;12), t(13;16)] insertions [e.g., ins(17;9), ins(20;Y)], duplications [e.g., i(8)(q10), dup(4)(q31q35)] and marker chromosomes in each case.

The unusual association of a Ph with an abnormality usually observed in a secondary myeloproliferative disease raises the question of whether the new finding is treatment-induced or part of the disease process and casually related to the acute transformation.","['Zamecnikova, A', 'Krizana, P', 'Gyarfas, J', 'Vahancik, A']","['Zamecnikova A', 'Krizana P', 'Gyarfas J', 'Vahancik A']","['National Cancer Institute, Department of Genetics, 833 10 Bratislava, Klenova 1, Slovakia. zabecan@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/06/27 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00434-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00434-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Jun;127(2):134-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00434-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a comparison of I-FISH, metaphase FISH (C-FISH), conventional cytogenetics, spectral karyotyping (SKY) and PCR for the detection of the t(9;22) and the BCR/ABL rearrangement in 32 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). FISH was done using a novel commercial probe set (VYSIS LSI BCR/ABL ES), which is designed to reduce the rate of false-positive results by marking the argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) gene and thus providing an extra signal on chromosome 9. Our data indicate, that a substantial number of BCR/ABL-positive patients (n=5 patients, 3 with Ph, 2 with masked Ph) present negative results using this probe set in I-FISH analyses, because they did not fulfill the scoring criteria. In fact, the ASS region, which usually remains on 9q in Ph+ CML, appears to be lost or translocated. Due to these results we recommend that the initial diagnosis as well as the follow-up of patients with Ph+ leukemias should not be based on a single technique but should integrate results of cytogenetics and molecular biology.","['Mohr, B', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Platzbecker, U', 'Freiberg-Richter, J', 'Naumann, R', 'Prange-Krex, G', 'Mohm, J', 'Kroschinsky, F', 'Ehninger, G', 'Thiede, C']","['Mohr B', 'Bornhauser M', 'Platzbecker U', 'Freiberg-Richter J', 'Naumann R', 'Prange-Krex G', 'Mohm J', 'Kroschinsky F', 'Ehninger G', 'Thiede C']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/06/27 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00371-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00371-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Jun;127(2):111-7. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00371-x.,,,,,,,,,"['Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2002 Jan 15;132(2):171.

METHODS: One hundred and eighty-two patients, aged from 50 to 98 years, were hospitalized for prostatic tumors. After a complete clinical exam followed by surgery, the operated organs were the subject of a conventional histological study. Data from the rectal touch (RT) were compared with the histological results. RESULTS: In the diagnosis of benignancy, RT and the histology are in agreement in 93% of the cases, though only in 75% of the cases of suspected malignancy. Seven percent of the occult cancers are observed, of which ten cases (6%) are adenocarcinoma at Stage A, and two cases (1%) of carcinoma in situ. We observe as well one case of prostatic localization of leukemia and one case of leiomyosarcoma. Prostatitic-type inflammatory lesions and malpighian metaplasias are very frequent 18 and 7%, respectively). Basal cell hyperplasia is rare. CONCLUSION: The RT keeps its place in the exploration of the prostate, within the framework of individual screening and patient follow-up. Transrectal echography and protein-specific antigen (PSA) dosing are certainly necessary but expensive in our country.

The drivers are exposed to relatively high magnetic fields (MF), ranging from a few to over a hundred microT. Although the possible genotoxic potential of MF is unclear, some earlier studies have indicated that occupational exposure to MF may increase chromosome aberrations in blood lymphocytes. Since an increased level of chromosomal aberrations has been suggested to predict elevated cancer risk, we performed a cytogenetic analysis on cultured (48 h) peripheral lymphocytes of Swedish train engine drivers. A pilot study of 18 engine drivers indicated a significant difference in the frequency of cells with chromosomal aberrations (gaps included or excluded) in comparison with seven concurrent referents (train dispatchers) and a control group of 16 office workers. The engine drivers had about four times higher frequency of cells with chromosome-type aberrations (excluding gaps) than the office workers (P < 0.01) and the dispatchers (P < 0.05). Seventy-eight percent of the engine drivers showed at least one cell per 100 with chromosome-type aberrations compared with 29% among the dispatchers and 31% among the office workers. In a follow-up study, another 30 engine drivers showed an increase (P < 0.05) in the frequency of cells with chromosome-type aberrations (gaps excluded) as compared with 30 referent policemen. Sixty percent of the engine drivers had one or more cells (per 100 cells) with chromosome-type aberrations compared with 30% among the policemen. In conclusion, the results of the two studies support the hypothesis that exposure to MF at mean intensities of 2-15 microT can induce chromosomal damage.","['Nordenson, I', 'Mild, K H', 'Jarventaus, H', 'Hirvonen, A', 'Sandstrom, M', 'Wilen, J', 'Blix, N', 'Norppa, H']","['Nordenson I', 'Mild KH', 'Jarventaus H', 'Hirvonen A', 'Sandstrom M', 'Wilen J', 'Blix N', 'Norppa H']","['National Institute for Working Life, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Magnetics/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pilot Projects', '*Railroads', 'Sweden']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/bem.55 [pii]', '10.1002/bem.55 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2001 Jul;22(5):306-15. doi: 10.1002/bem.55.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of this study was to investigate exposure-related questions raised by these two papers in two U.S. data sets, one containing single spot measurements of static magnetic fields at two locations in homes located in eight states, and the other repeated spot measurements (seven times during the course of one year) of the static magnetic fields at the centers of bedrooms and family rooms and on the surfaces of beds in 51 single-family homes in two metropolitan areas. Using Bowman's criterion, bedrooms were first classified as being in-resonance or not-in-resonance based on the average of repeated measurements of the static magnetic field measured on the bed where the presumed important exposure actually occurred. Bedrooms were then classified a second time using single spot measurements taken at the centers of bedrooms, centers of family rooms, or on the surfaces of beds, as would be done in the typical epidemiologic study.

Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), the most detrimental complication of allogeneic BMT, largely resides within the same lymphocyte population. Therefore, separation of GVL- and GVH-reactions is a long-standing goal of experimental studies dealing with allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The objective of the current study was to assess the potential of Th1- and Th2-type CD4+ T cells in mediating GVHD and GVL effects in a fully allogeneic murine transplant model. BALB/c (H-2d) mice were given a dose of A20 (H-2d, B-cell leukemia) cells two days prior to lethal total body irradiation (TBI) and transplantation of fully mismatched (C57BL/6, H-2b) T-cell depleted (anti-Thy1.2, CD90) bone marrow (TCD-BM) cells. Graded numbers of either unmanipulated, Th1- or Th2-polarized highly enriched CD4+ donor type T cells (10(6) or 10(7)) were administered 2 h posttransplant. Infusion of 10(6) of unmanipulated, Th1-, or Th2-primed CD4+ T cells resulted in moderate GVHD-related mortality (40%, 50%, 10%) and significantly improved long-term survival (50%, 45%, 46% surviving the observation period of 120 days) as compared to animals receiving TCD-BM alone (18%). RESULTS: The administration of 10(7) unmanipulated or Th1-type CD4+ T cells given shortly after transplantation led to death of all mice within 50 days due to fatal acute GVHD. In contrast, the adoptive transfer of 10(7) Th2-primed CD4+ T cells resulted in significant improvement of long-term survival (80%) compared to the TCD-BM group. This powerful GVL effect was associated with a substantially lower incidence of lethal acute GVHD (10%) if compared to the results of transplantation of Th1-type CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that allogeneic Th2-type CD4+ T cells given post BMT can induce GVL effects in a cell-dose-dependent manner without increasing the risk of severe acute GVHD.","['Zeis, M', 'Uharek, L', 'Hartung, G', 'Glass, B', 'Steinmann, J', 'Schmitz, N']","['Zeis M', 'Uharek L', 'Hartung G', 'Glass B', 'Steinmann J', 'Schmitz N']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany. mzeis47@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/methods', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Graft vs Host Disease/metabolism/*therapy', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Th1 Cells/*transplantation', 'Th2 Cells/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/06/26 10:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2000/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2000/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj/thj/6200087 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2001;2(2):136-44. doi: 10.1038/sj/thj/6200087.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four HTLV-I-transformed cell lines (HuT-102, MT2, C8166 and C91PL) were treated with different doses of ATRA alone or in combination with As for one to three days. Cell growth was assessed by cell count with 3H-thymidine incorporation. Cell cycle distribution was assessed by propidium iodine-labeled DNA content by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst nuclear staining and annexin-V binding assays. Expression of retinoid receptors, the viral transactivator Tax, and the proteins bcl-2 and IkappaB-alpha proteins, was analysed by Western blot. RESULTS: Only C8166 cells were sensitive to the ATRA-induced growth inhibitory effect while HuT-102, MT2, and C91PL were resistant to ATRA treatment (up to 10(-5) M). The retinoid X receptor alpha and the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARgamma) proteins were expressed in all four cell lines, while RARalpha protein was only detected in the HuT-102 and C8166 cells. The combination ATRA/As showed a highly synergistic effect on HuT-102 cells, and, to a lesser extent, on C8166 cells and resulted in a dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of massive apoptosis in HuT-102 cells, associated with caspase activation. While ATRA alone had no effect on Tax and IkappaB-alpha protein levels, ATRA increased the As-induced Tax degradation and the up-regulation of IkappaB-alpha protein. In contrast, the expression of bcl-2 protein was not significantly affected by any of the treatments. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a rationale for combined ATRA and As-therapies in ATL patients refractory to conventional therapy and expressing RARalpha in their leukemic cells.","['Darwiche, N', 'El-Sabban, M', 'Bazzi, R', 'Nasr, R', 'Al-Hashimi, S', 'Hermine, O', 'de The, H', 'Bazarbachi, A']","['Darwiche N', 'El-Sabban M', 'Bazzi R', 'Nasr R', 'Al-Hashimi S', 'Hermine O', 'de The H', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Biology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. nd03@aub.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2001/06/26 10:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2000/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2000/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj/thj/6200098 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2001;2(2):127-35. doi: 10.1038/sj/thj/6200098.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, a prospective validation of the therapeutic efficacy of a protocol (or a component thereof) in specific risk groups is uncommon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1996-1999 a risk-oriented program (08/96) was evaluated in 102/121 unselected patients (median age 35 years, blast count 0-450 x 10(9)/l, 100 B(lin) (lineage), 21 T(lin)) responsive to induction therapy. The standard risk (SR) class was B(lin) CD10+ Ph- with blasts < 10 x 10(9)/l (prior studies: disease-free survival (DFS) rate 52% at five years with dose-intensive anthracycline-containing programs). The SR protocol was therefore anthracycline-rich (early consolidation cycles with total idarubicin 96 mg/m2), and comprised long-term maintenance. High-risk (HR) patients were eligible to the following three options: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from related family donor; short sequence with high-dose cyclophosphamide-cytarabine-methotrexate followed by melphalan/total body irradiation with autologous HSCT; or T(lin) ALL chemotherapy regimen inclusive of high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. RESULTS: Treatment realization and three-year DFS rates according to risk class, HR subset and postremission treatment intensity were the following. SR group (n = 28): realization rate 93%, DFS 68.5%. HR group (n = 74): realization rate 80%, DFS 39% (P = 0.052 vs SR category). In HR group, three-year DFS rates by disease subtype were the following. B(lin) Ph- (n = 35) 43%; Ph+ (n = 19) 13% at 2.7 years (P = 0.006 vs other HR subtypes); T(lin) (n = 18) 59.5%. And DFS rates by treatment intensity were: allograft (n = 21) 40%; autograft (n = 28) 27%; shift to SR protocol (n = 13) 52% (P = ns vs allograft/autograft); T(lin) program (n = 10) 57%. Matched analyses of treatment protocols and disease subtypes suggested a possible therapeutic role of the autograft regimen in B(lin) Ph- ALL with a blast count < 25 x 10(9)/l, and of T(lin) protocol for T(lin) ALL. Comparisons with retrospective control cohorts were confirmatory of anthracycline activity in SR subclass. CONCLUSION: The intended strategy was applicable to the majority of study patients, confirming the value of anthracyclines in SR class and, preliminarily, the usefulness a T(lin)-specific treatment. Apart from the case of Ph+ ALL, the indications for high-dose procedures with HSCT remains largely undetermined in this study.","['Bassan, R', 'Pogliani, E', 'Casula, P', 'Rossi, G', 'Fabris, P', 'Morandi, S', 'Lambertenghi-Deliliers, G', 'Vespignani, M', 'Lerede, T', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Borleri, G', 'Spedini, P', 'Cortelezzi, A', 'Izzi, T', 'Coser, P', 'Broccia, G', 'Corneo, G', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Pogliani E', 'Casula P', 'Rossi G', 'Fabris P', 'Morandi S', 'Lambertenghi-Deliliers G', 'Vespignani M', 'Lerede T', 'Rambaldi A', 'Borleri G', 'Spedini P', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Izzi T', 'Coser P', 'Broccia G', 'Corneo G', 'Barbui T']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy. ematologia@cyberg.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2001/06/26 10:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2000/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2000/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj/thj/6200091 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2001;2(2):117-26. doi: 10.1038/sj/thj/6200091.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since there is evidence from prostate cancer cells that par-4 is involved in regulation of bcl-2 we assessed expression of par-4 and bcl-2 in different populations of normal and neoplastic lymphocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of par-4 mRNA and protein in different subpopulations of normal and neoplastic lymphocytes was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. RESULTS: Par-4 mRNA was not detectable in lymphocytes of healthy volunteers (n = 10), but was present in the majority of samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 30), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 6) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 10). Par-4 protein was expressed unanimously in samples of mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers and patients with CLL, but less frequently in immature lymphocytes, including neoplastic cells of CLL/PLL and ALL. The decreased frequency of par-4 expression in immature subpopulations was confirmed by results on lymphocytic cell lines at various stages of maturation. Comparing the expressional patterns of par-4 and bcl-2 there was an inverse relationship of both proteins in ALL and different lymphocytic cell lines, indicating a functional relationship of par-4 and bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes par-4 as a factor expressed in the majority of normal and neoplastic lymphocytic cells, demonstrating a decreased frequency of protein expression in less differentiated lymphocytes and an inverse expressional pattern of par-4 and bcl-2 in lymphocytic cell lines and ALL.","['Boehrer, S', 'Chow, K U', 'Puccetti, E', 'Ruthardt, M', 'Godzisard, S', 'Krapohl, A', 'Schneider, B', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Rangnekar, V M', 'Weidmann, E']","['Boehrer S', 'Chow KU', 'Puccetti E', 'Ruthardt M', 'Godzisard S', 'Krapohl A', 'Schneider B', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Rangnekar VM', 'Weidmann E']","['Department of Medicine III, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (prostate apoptosis response-4 protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis']",2001/06/26 10:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2000/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2000/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj/thj/6200089 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2001;2(2):103-7. doi: 10.1038/sj/thj/6200089.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On normal myeloid progenitors, retinoids switch the differentiation program of granulo-macrophagic progenitors towards the granulocytic lineage and consequently reduce CFU-M colony formation. Bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with Juvenile Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia show typical spontaneous monocytic growth. We questioned whether in this disease, retinoids could switch myelomonocytic growth and inhibit the abnormal CFU-M colony proliferation. METHODS: Ten JCML samples were studied in the presence of ATRA in methyl cellulose colony assay, before (CFU-C) or after (pre-CFU) liquid suspension culture. RESULTS: In vitro characteristics of JCML such as spontaneous monocytic growth in the absence of growth factor was noted in all patients. In the presence of leucocyte-conditioned medium, nine samples showed only CFU-M growth and one sample CFU-GM growth. Incubation with ATRA inhibited CFU-M colony formation in nine cases. Enhancement of granulocytic differentiation (CFU-G) was noted in nine cases. ATRA also inhibited CD34+ JCML monocytic growth and GM-CSF hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that, in JCML progenitors, retinoid pathways are functional and inhibition of immature monocytic progenitors cells may be achieved with retinoids, without impeding granulocytic cell growth.","['Cambier, N', 'Menot, M L', 'Schlageter, M H', 'Balitrand, N', 'Leblanc, T', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Rohrlich, P', 'Lamagnere, J P', 'Donadieu, J', 'Herbelin, C', 'Puissant, C', 'Gourand, F', 'Baruchel, A', 'Chomienne, C']","['Cambier N', 'Menot ML', 'Schlageter MH', 'Balitrand N', 'Leblanc T', 'Bordigoni P', 'Rohrlich P', 'Lamagnere JP', 'Donadieu J', 'Herbelin C', 'Puissant C', 'Gourand F', 'Baruchel A', 'Chomienne C']","['LBCH (laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique) Service de Medecine Nucleaire, INSERM E00-03, Hopital Saint Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, Paris 75475, Paris cedex 10, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/26 10:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['1999/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2000/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj/thj/6200099 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2001;2(2):97-102. doi: 10.1038/sj/thj/6200099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the Shc adaptor proteins p52/p46Shc, which can activate the RAS/Mitogen Activated Protein kinase pathway, p66Shc which is uncoupled from RAS/MAP kinases and the MAP kinase family members Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal protein Kinase (JNK) or Stress Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK). MATERIAL AND METHODS: CD34+ and CD34- fractions of four human normal bone marrow and unfractionated bone marrow samples were investigated. Immunoblottings, immunoenzymatic and in vitro assays were performed. RESULTS: Shc protein isoforms were constitutively expressed in all the AML cases examined. Tyrosine-phosphorylation of p53/p46Shc isoforms were found in CD34+ but not in the majority of CD34- cases. p66Shc isoform was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in CD34-, and was tyrosine-phosphorylated only in some CD34+ cases. Expression and activation of ERK was constitutively present in the majority of AML patients analysed. JNK/SAPK was expressed but not activated in the AMLs examined. Activation occurred after treatment of the leukemic cells by anisomycin, etoposide, and cytarabine. ERK and JNK/SAPK activation were not detectable in the hematopoietic precursors of human normal bone-marrow.

Despite major progress in the understanding of the global effects of p53 on cellular function the pathways by which p53 activates apoptosis are not well defined. To study genes activated in the p53 induced apoptotic process, we used a mouse myeloid leukemic cell line (LTR6) expressing the temperature-sensitive p53 (val135) that undergoes apoptosis upon shifting the temperature to 32 degrees C. We analysed the gene expression profile at different time points after p53 activation using oligonucleotide microarray capable of detecting approximately 11,000 mRNA species. Cluster analysis of the p53-regulated genes indicate a pattern of early and late induced sets of genes. We show that 91 and 44 genes were substantially up and down regulated, respectively, by p53. Functional classification of these genes reveals that they are involved in many aspects of cell function, in addition to growth arrest and apoptosis. Comparison of p53 regulated gene expression profile in LTR6 cells to that of a human lung cancer cell line (H1299) that undergoes growth arrest but not apoptosis demonstrates that only 15% of the genes are common to both systems. This observation supports the presence of two distinct transcriptional programs in response to p53 signaling, one leading to growth arrest and the other to apoptosis. The proapoptotic genes induced only in LTR6 cells like Apaf-1, Sumo-1 and gelsolin among others may suggest a possible explanation for apoptosis in LTR6 cells.","['Kannan, K', 'Kaminski, N', 'Rechavi, G', 'Jakob-Hirsch, J', 'Amariglio, N', 'Givol, D']","['Kannan K', 'Kaminski N', 'Rechavi G', 'Jakob-Hirsch J', 'Amariglio N', 'Givol D']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Apaf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', '*Genes', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Temperature', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2000/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2001/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2001/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204446 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jun 7;20(26):3449-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204446.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, multiple signaling pathways control this induction and thus determine this sensitivity. We report here that staurosporine, a well known inducer of apoptosis in a wide range of cell lines, displays distinct ability to trigger apoptosis in two different L1210 sublines (termed L1210/S and L1210/0). Staurosporine treatment resulted in an early cell death (within 3 h) in L1210/S cells, while in L1210/0 cells, death occurred only after 12 h. In both instances, death occurred by apoptosis. A broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, blocked early apoptosis in L1210/S cells but did not confer any protection on late apoptosis in L1210/0 cells. Protection by Z-VAD-fmk observed in L1210/S cells was not lasting and unmasked a secondary process of cell death that also exhibited characteristics of apoptosis. Thus, staurosporine induces apoptotic cell death through at least two redundant parallel pathways. These two pathways normally coexist in L1210/S cells.

Although preliminary evidence indicates that the (fusion) proteins encoded by these genes may play a role in transcriptional regulation, little is known about their exact function. We set out to isolate interacting proteins through yeast two hybrid screening of a human cDNA library using SYT as a bait. Of the positive clones isolated, two were found to correspond to the acute leukemia t(10;11) associated AF10 gene, a fusion partner of MLL. Confirmation of these results was obtained via co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous and exogenous, epitope-tagged, SYT and AF10 proteins from cell line extracts and colocalization of epitope-tagged SYT and AF10 proteins in transfected cells. Subsequent sequential mutation analysis revealed a highly specific interaction of N-terminal SYT fragments with C-terminal AF10 fragments. The N-terminal interaction domain of the SYT protein was also found to be present in several SYT orthologs and homologs. The C-terminal interaction domain of AF10 is located outside known functional domains. Based on these results, a model is proposed in which the SYT and AF10 proteins act in concert as bipartite transcription factors. This model has implications for the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of both human synovial sarcomas and acute leukemias.","['de Bruijn, D R', 'dos Santos, N R', 'Thijssen, J', 'Balemans, M', 'Debernardi, S', 'Linder, B', 'Young, B D', 'Geurts van Kessel, A']","['de Bruijn DR', 'dos Santos NR', 'Thijssen J', 'Balemans M', 'Debernardi S', 'Linder B', 'Young BD', 'Geurts van Kessel A']","['Department of Human Genetics, University Hospital, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SS18 protein, human)', '0 (Ss18 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Sarcoma, Synovial/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2000/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2001/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204419 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 May 31;20(25):3281-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204419.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of its action remains to be elucidated. Recent studies suggest that the lysosomal protease cathepsin D, when released from lysosomes to the cytosol, can initiate apoptosis. In this study, we examined whether cathepsin D and free radicals are involved in the CD437-induced apoptosis. Exposure of human leukemia HL-60 cells to CD437 resulted in rapid induction of apoptosis as indicated by caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial alterations and morphological changes. Addition of the antioxidants alpha-tocopherol acetate effectively inhibited the CD437-induced apoptosis. Measurement of the intracellular free radicals indicated a rise in oxidative stress in CD437-treated cells, which could be attenuated by alpha-tocopherol acetate. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A blocked the CD437-induced free radical formation and apoptotic effects, suggesting the involvement of cathepsin D. However, Western blotting revealed no difference in cellular quantity of any forms of cathepsin D between control cells and CD437-treated cells, whereas immunofluorescence analysis of the intracellular distribution of cathepsin D showed release of the enzyme from lysosomes to the cytosol. Labeling of lysosomes with lysosomotropic probes confirmed that CD437 could induce lysosomal leakage. The CD437-induced relocation of cathepsin D could not be prevented by alpha-tocopherol acetate, suggesting that the lysosomal leakage precedes free radical formation. Furthermore, a retinoic acid nuclear receptor (RAR) antagonist failed to block these effects of CD437, suggesting that the action of CD437 is RAR-independent. Taken together, these data suggest a novel lysosomal pathway for CD437-induced apoptosis, in which lysosomes are the primary target and cathepsin D and free radicals act as death mediators.","['Zang, Y', 'Beard, R L', 'Chandraratna, R A', 'Kang, J X']","['Zang Y', 'Beard RL', 'Chandraratna RA', 'Kang JX']","['Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CD 437)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Pepstatins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '11076-29-2 (Streptomyces pepsin inhibitor)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)', 'V6Y2T27Q1U (pepstatin)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cathepsin D/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cytosol/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Free Radicals/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Pepstatins/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Retinoids/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tocopherols', 'Vitamin E/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*alpha-Tocopherol/*analogs & derivatives']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2000/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2000/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2001/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400843 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2001 May;8(5):477-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400843.,,,,['CA-79553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survivors of childhood cancer are especially vulnerable because they are affected during childhood and adolescence, a time when peak bone mass should be achieved. This paper reviews decreased bone density in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is the most common childhood cancer and has a cure rate approaching 80%. Osteopenia/osteoporosis has been observed in all phases of the disease: at diagnosis, during treatment, and throughout the post-treatment period for as long as 20 years. Among the findings that have been described are musculoskeletal pain, disturbed gait, fractures, kyphosis, lordosis, and growth failure. Risk factors not specifically related to ALL include smoking, ingestion of carbonated beverages, and family history of ""brittle bone"" or fractures. Patients should be counseled in regard to diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and avoidance of carbonated beverages. There are a number of options for specific drug therapy; however, the administration of bisphosponates to children and adolescents must be approached with caution. Research is needed to determine how extensive the problem is and how to best prevent and treat the osteopenia/osteoporosis associated with ALL.","['Haddy, T B', 'Mosher, R B', 'Reaman, G H']","['Haddy TB', 'Mosher RB', 'Reaman GH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, 111 Michigan Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20010-2970, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Humans', 'Osteoporosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', '*Survivors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.6-3-278 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2001;6(3):278-85. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.6-3-278.,,,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of clinical trials to date have demonstrated the crucial role of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) pathogenesis and the potential of anticancer agents designed to target specific molecular abnormalities in human cancer. An initial phase I study of STI571 included 83 Ph(+) CML patients who had failed interferon-based therapy. Patients were required to be in chronic phase, defined liberally as less than 15% blasts in blood or bone marrow. Patients were treated with once-daily oral doses of STI571 in 14 successive dose cohorts ranging from 25-1,000 mg. In this phase I study, no dose-limiting toxicity was encountered and toxicity at all dose levels was minimal. The threshold for a maximally effective dose was found at 300 mg; for patients treated at or above this level, complete hematologic response was seen in 98% of patients, with complete cytogenetic responses in 13% and major cytogenetic responses in 31%. With a median duration of follow-up of 310 days, ongoing responses are evident in 96% of patients. In the phase II study of the accelerated phase of CML, 233 patients were treated with either 400 or 600 mg of STI571. With similar follow-up to the chronic phase trial, 91% of patients showed a hematological response; 63% of patients achieved a complete hematological response but not all patients had recovery of peripheral blood counts. In addition to the phase II clinical trials with STI571, a phase III trial randomizing newly diagnosed patients to either interferon with low-dose s.c. cytosine arabinoside versus STI571 is ongoing; this trial accrued rapidly and data collection is ongoing. Integration of STI571 into CML treatment algorithms will require long-term follow-up data from the ongoing phase II and III clinical studies.","['Mauro, M J', 'Druker, B J']","['Mauro MJ', 'Druker BJ']","['Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, 3181 Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97201, USA. maurom@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Genes, abl/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.6-3-233 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2001;6(3):233-8. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.6-3-233.,,,,,24,,,,['Oncologist. 2001;6(3):230-2.

In six of nine patients, resistance was associated with a single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This substitution of threonine with isoleucine was sufficient to confer STI-571 resistance in a reconstitution experiment.

The role of these factors and their interaction is less established in cardiac transplant recipients. We sought to characterize the role of these factors in these patients. Cardiac transplant patients who presented for surveillance coronary angiography and/or endomyocardial biopsy were eligible for enrollment. Ninety-nine consecutive patients were enrolled. Plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, von Willebrand factor, fibrin D-dimer, and anti-t-PA antibody were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Anti-THP-1 cell antibodies directed against a monocytic leukemia cell line were detected by incubating patient plasma with THP-1 cells. Bound antibody was detected using goat peroxidase-labeled immunoglobulin G directed against human immunoglobulins. Lipids were measured by enzymatic methods.

ANIMALS STUDIED: Thirty-four random source cats. PROCEDURES: Seventeen cats were found positive for FeLV serum p27 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Twelve ELISA positive cats were also positive on peripheral blood samples by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) testing. Seventeen ELISA negative cats served as negative controls. Full thickness corneal specimens were collected from the left cornea of all cats and analyzed for FeLV proviral DNA and gp70 antigen by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) testing, respectively. RESULTS: Eleven (64.7%) positive corneal PCR results were obtained from 17 ELISA positive cats. Of 12 cats that were both ELISA and IFA positive on peripheral blood, 10 (83.3%) had positive corneal PCR results. All corneal tissues from ELISA negative cats were PCR negative. IHC staining of corneal sections revealed the presence of FeLV gp70 in corneal tissues of nine (52.9%) ELISA positive cats. Of the 12 cats that were both ELISA and IFA positive on peripheral blood, eight (66.7%) had positive corneal IHC results. Positive IHC staining was localized to the corneal epithelium. Corneal tissues of all ELISA negative cats and all IFA negative cats were negative on IHC testing. CONCLUSIONS: FeLV antigens and proviral DNA are present in corneal tissues of some FeLV-infected cats. Screening corneal donors for FeLV infection is warranted.","['Herring, I P', 'Troy, G C', 'Toth, T E', 'Champagne, E S', 'Pickett, J P', 'Haines, D M']","['Herring IP', 'Troy GC', 'Toth TE', 'Champagne ES', 'Pickett JP', 'Haines DM']","['Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences and Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0442, USA. iherring@vt.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vet Ophthalmol,Veterinary ophthalmology,100887377,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Cornea/*virology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/veterinary', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary/virology']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['vop187 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1463-5224.2001.00187.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Ophthalmol. 2001 Jun;4(2):119-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1463-5224.2001.00187.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At low concentrations, tryptanthrin enhanced the expression of cell differentiation (CD) markers in human monocytic (U-937) and promyelocytic (HL-60) leukemia cells indicative of differentiation to monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reductive and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (NBE) activities were markedly increased after treatment. Tryptanthrin was more potent than dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at inducing U-937 cell differentiation into monocytes/macrophages. After treatment with higher concentrations of tryptanthrin for 24 h, cytoplasmic vacuolation and destruction of mitochondria were observed. The leukemia cells died via apoptosis 48 h after treatment. Cytoplasmic vacuolation and apoptotic changes correlated with the dysfunction of mitochondria. Electron microscopic observations revealed marked swelling and destruction of mitochondria after exposure of the leukemia cells to tryptanthrin. Exposure to tryptanthrin enhanced Fas-induced apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activity before induction of apoptosis. These results show that low concentrations of tryptanthrin can induce differentiation of leukemia cells but higher concentrations will kill leukemia cells through apoptosis, possibly through a caspase-3/Fas antigen pathway.","['Kimoto, T', 'Hino, K', 'Koya-Miyata, S', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Takeuchi, M', 'Nishizaki, Y', 'Micallef, M J', 'Ushio, S', 'Iwaki, K', 'Ikeda, M', 'Kurimoto, M']","['Kimoto T', 'Hino K', 'Koya-Miyata S', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Takeuchi M', 'Nishizaki Y', 'Micallef MJ', 'Ushio S', 'Iwaki K', 'Ikeda M', 'Kurimoto M']","['Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories Inc., Fujisaki Institute, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '13220-57-0 (tryptanthrine)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['pin1204 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-1827.2001.01204.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2001 May;51(5):315-25. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1827.2001.01204.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have studied the Fas/FasL system in relation to clinical progression in B-CLL. Serum levels of soluble Fas (sFas) and FasL (sFasL) were determined by ELISA in 43 progressive and 40 non-progressive B-CLL patients and in 21 control individuals. Correlation between sFas serum levels and clinical progression, stage and survival were statistically analyzed. We found high levels of sFas in B-CLL sera correlated with disease progression (p<0.01). In addition, higher sFas levels were found in patients in stages II, III and IV in comparison to patients in stage 0 (p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.03, respectively). Survival was significantly shorter for patients with > or =6 ng/ml sFas serum levels, although a multivariate analysis did not show sFas to be a significant independent prognostic factor. Fresh B-CLL cells showed only low levels of membrane expression, which were not correlated to sFas levels in serum. In vitro activation of B-CLL cells increased Fas expression, as reported earlier, and induced cells to release sFas into the supernatant. In conclusion, our results indicate that sFas in serum may be a useful parameter for the prediction of clinical progression in B-CLL.","['Osorio, L M', 'Aguilar-Santelises, M', 'De Santiago, A', 'Hachiya, T', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Jondal, M']","['Osorio LM', 'Aguilar-Santelises M', 'De Santiago A', 'Hachiya T', 'Mellstedt H', 'Jondal M']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Department of Hematology, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. lydoso@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Solubility', 'fas Receptor/*blood']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh328 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066005342.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 May;66(5):342-6. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066005342.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant periodicity was confirmed with the use of the Lomb periodogram. This is Fourier power spectral analysis tailored for unevenly sampled data. The patient with PV had marked oscillations of platelet counts with a periodicity of 29 d and an amplitude of (202-588)x10(9)/L. Smaller oscillations of neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte numbers and Hb levels occurred with a similar periodicity. Anticipatory changes in hydroxyurea dosage or the maintenance of a constant dose did not abolish periodicity, but a change in therapy to the non-cycle-specific drug anagrelide dampened and abolished the cycling. One of the patients with CML had tremendous and clear oscillations in white cell, platelet and Hb levels, with a mean periodicity of 74 d. The other had erratic counts which were confirmed to be significantly periodic (64 d), on spectral analysis. A change in therapy to busulphan in both these patients again dampened and abolished the cycling. Hydroxyurea, which is a cell-cycle-specific agent, probably exacerbates the periodicity which may be present in some patients with myeloproliferative disease.

Four bands of slightly differing intensity were seen after EcoRI digestion of skin and lymph node samples on Southern blot analysis of HTLV-1 proviral DNA. Analysis for T-cell receptor-beta gene revealed five novel bands after restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII, indicating that the patient has four separate tumour cell clones, each of which carries one copy of the provirus.

METHODS: Single oral doses of 40 mg of 6-TG were administered both in the fasting and fed state to children with ALL. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed up to 6 h post dose. Daily oral doses of 40 mg m(-2) of 6-TG were administered both fasting and after food over two 4 week periods. Twice weekly samples were taken for metabolite concentrations. The study design was cross-over with each child receiving dosing in either fasted or after food over a 4 week period in each phase. RESULTS: Eleven patients were studied. A wide interindividual variation in Cmax (median 313 pmol ml(-1), range 51-737) and AUC (median 586 pmol ml(-1) h, range 156-1306) was observed in the fasted state. Concomitant food administration resulted in a significant reduction in Cmax (median 71 vs 313 pmol ml(-1), P = 0.006, CI from 36 to 426), AUC (median 200 vs 586 pmol ml(-1) h, P = 0.006, 95% CI from 109 to 692), and time to reach Cmax (median 1.5 vs 3 h, P = 0.013, 95% CI from 0.74 to 2.73). There was no difference in the steady state concentration of red cell 6-TGNs observed after a 4 week period of 6-TG administered fasting or after food. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL demonstrate significant interindividual variation in 6-TG pharmacokinetics. Although there would appear to be a reduction in parent drug Cmax and AUC with food there was no difference in 6-TGN concentrations after 4 weeks of 6-TG. Taking the drug on an empty stomach may not be necessary.","['Lancaster, D L', 'Patel, N', 'Lennard, L', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Lancaster DL', 'Patel N', 'Lennard L', 'Lilleyman JS']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine, The Royal London Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Fasting', '*Food', 'Food-Drug Interactions/*physiology', 'Genetic Variation', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*analysis/blood', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['bcp1391 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01391.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2001 Jun;51(6):531-9. doi: 10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01391.x.,PMC2014483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examined the extent and the localization of phosphorylated Stat3 protein in brain tissue after focal ischemia in rats. The localizations of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Stat3 were immunohistochemically examined in rats after 0.5 to 168 h of reperfusion following 1.5 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), induced by the intraluminal suture method. Absolute phosphorylated Stat3 immunoreactive cell counts were made in the cerebral cortex (ischemic core, peri-ischemia region, and contralareral cortex) and lateral striatal regions on both the ischemic and the contralateral sides. Stat3 protein was localized diffusely in cortical and striatal neurons in the sham-operated animals. Although weak Stat3 staining was detected in damaged neurons in the ischemic region, activated microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells clearly expressed Stat3 in this region. On the other hand, the sham group showed no phosphorylated Stat3 immunoreactivity. Phosphorylated Stat3 immunoreactivity was first detected in neurons after 3.5 h of reperfusion in each cortical and striatal region. Thereafter, Stat3 phosphorylation was marked in neurons in the peri-infarct region, peaked at 24 h, and then gradually declined throughout the reperfusion period. Endothelial cells expressed phosphorylated Stat3 in the ischemic core at 48 h of reperfusion. To identify the cellular source of phosphorylated Stat3, lectin histochemical study and immunohistochemical study with anti-microtubule-associated proten-2 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies were carried out. Double-staining immunohistochemistry with these cellular makers revealed phosphorylated Stat3 to be present in neurons, but in neither astrocytes nor microglia/macrophages. These results were also confirmed be western blot analysis. The present results indicate that Stat3 activation occurs in neurons and endothelial cells only during post-ischemic reperfusion despite widespread expression of IL-6 cytokines.","['Suzuki, S', 'Tanaka, K', 'Nogawa, S', 'Dembo, T', 'Kosakai, A', 'Fukuuchi, Y']","['Suzuki S', 'Tanaka K', 'Nogawa S', 'Dembo T', 'Kosakai A', 'Fukuuchi Y']","['Department of Neurology, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Ischemia/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cerebral Cortex/blood supply/metabolism/pathology', 'Corpus Striatum/blood supply/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/complications/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Macrophages/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microglia/metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reperfusion', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/exnr.2001.7701 [doi]', 'S0014-4886(01)97701-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 2001 Jul;170(1):63-71. doi: 10.1006/exnr.2001.7701.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

We observed hematological improvement due to high-dose methylprednisolone in 9 of 18 patients with refractory anemia. The patients' age range was from 28 to 78 years old (mean age: 54), including 14 male and 4 females. A complete response was obtained in 5 patients, minimal response in 4 patients, and no response in 9 patients. Laboratory data of peripheral blood counts and differential counts of bone marrow aspirates were not different, except that fewer chromosomal abnormalities (P = 0.086) were observed in the responder group. Side effects were seen in two patients but were controllable. Overall survival was significantly longer in the responder group (Log-rank P = 0.040, Wilcoxon P = 0.045). The overall survival of responders did not reach the median and 85% of the patients were alive after 180 months, while the median overall survival of the nonresponders was 61.8 months. Disease progression was more frequently seen in the non-responder group (P = 0.045).

Our present results indicate that high-dose methylprednisolone is valuable as a primary treatment before other immunosuppressive treatments, because of its ease of use.

DATA SOURCES: Journal articles, books, and clinical experience. DATA SYNTHESIS: Childhood ALL is a heterogeneous disorder, and current treatment is tailored to risk factors (e.g., initial white blood count, cytogenetic properties of the leukemic blasts). Risk-directed therapy ensures that children with a higher risk of relapse receive more intensive treatment, whereas those with lower risk disease receive less toxic therapy with decreased potential for treatment-related morbidity. Quality of life in long-term survivors is a significant issue. Late sequelae of treatment can include neurocognitive difficulties, endocrine dysfunction, secondary malignancies, and cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: With risk-directed therapy, cure rates for childhood ALL continue to improve. At least 80% of children diagnosed with ALL today are expected to survive their disease. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses caring for children with ALL can have a significant impact on the children's overall health, from diagnosis through long-term follow-up. Nursing interventions encompass the domains of physical and psychosocial care, as well as patient and family education. Assisting the child and family to maintain normalcy in the face of chronic illness, as well as fostering the family's hope for the future and their belief in the child's potential for survival, are key nursing strategies that promote the child's growth, development, and psychological health.","['Landier, W']",['Landier W'],"['City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA. wlandier@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/prevention & control', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/history/psychology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",2001/06/26 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2001 Jun;28(5):823-33; quiz 834-5.,,,,,55,,,,,,,,,,['Oncol Nurs Forum 2001 Aug;28(7):1083'],,

It is intuitive that a successful therapeutic strategy for cancer should aim at blocking the aberrant biochemical activity triggered by the oncogene or the lack of tumor suppressor gene activity that ultimately leads to full-blown neoplastic transformation. However, an attractive alternative approach entails the blockade of the transcriptional consequences of such oncogenic activities irrespective of their original biochemical nature, thus antagonizing the key transcriptional events underlying cancer pathogenesis in any specific neoplastic cellular population. This approach is now rendered possible by major advances along several lines of investigation: (i) the possibility of analysing gene expression through high throughput methods; (ii) a more detailed knowledge of the regulatory regions and of the transcription factors that control gene expression also facilitated in the future by a comprehensive whole genome comparative analysis of these regulatory sequences; (iii) the ability of modulating gene expression at the single gene level through various approaches both pharmacological and biochemical; (iv) the opportunity of directly antagonizing the aberrant activities of oncogenic transcription factors through a detailed knowledge of their abnormal transcriptional function; (v) the possibility of validating, in vivo, in animal models the relevance for neoplastic transformation of specific transcriptional events as well as of testing the efficacy of 'transcription therapy' in faithful animal models of human cancer.

Oligomerization of RAR, through a self-association domain present in PML, imposes an altered interaction with transcriptional co-regulators (NCoR/SMRT). NCoR/SMRT are responsible for recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), which is required for transcriptional repression of PML-RAR target genes, and for the transforming potential of the fusion protein. Oligomerization and altered recruitment of HDACs are also responsible for transformation by the fusion protein AML1-ETO, extending these mechanisms to other forms of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and suggesting that HDAC is a common target for myeloid leukemias. Strikingly, AML1-ETO expression blocks retinoic acid (RA) signaling in hematopoietic cells, suggesting that interference with the RA pathway (genetically altered in APL) by HDAC recruitment may be a common theme in AMLs. Treatment of APLs with RA, and of other AMLs with RA plus HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), results in myeloid differentiation. Thus, activation of the RA signaling pathway and inhibition of HDAC activity might represent a general strategy for the differentiation treatment of myeloid leukemias.","['Minucci, S', 'Nervi, C', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Minucci S', 'Nervi C', 'Lo Coco F', 'Pelicci PG']","['European Institute of Oncology, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2001/06/23 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/23 10:00'],"['2001/06/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204336 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 May 28;20(24):3110-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204336.,,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,

A plethora of studies revealed that the acetylation status of histones is controlled by multi-protein complexes containing (de)acetylase activities. In the current model, histone deacetylases and acetyltransferases are recruited to chromatin by DNA-bound repressors and activators, respectively. Shifting the balance between deacetylation, i.e. repressive chromatin and acetylation, i.e. active chromatin can lead to aberrant gene transcription and cancer. In human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and avian erythroleukemia (AEL), chromosomal translocations and/or mutations in nuclear hormone receptors, RARalpha [NR1B1] and TRalpha [NR1A1], yielded oncoproteins that deregulate transcription and alter chromatin structure. The oncogenic receptors are locked in their 'off' mode thereby constitutively repressing transcription of genes that are critical for differentiation of hematopoietic cells. AEL involves an oncogenic version of the chicken TRalpha, v-ErbA. Apart from repression by v-ErbA via recruitment of corepressor complexes, other repressors and corepressors appear to be involved in repression of v-ErbA target genes, such as carbonic anhydrase II (CAII).

When infected with the polycythemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FVP), p53 null mice exhibited accelerated progression to erythroleukemia and accelerated death following diagnosis when compared to wild type mice. Confirmation that p53 mutations were required for disease progression was provided by sequence analysis of p53 transcripts in leukemic wild type and heterozygous mice. All transcripts evaluated had point mutations, deletions or insertions in the p53 gene. The ability to grow tumor colonies in vitro and derive cell lines was enhanced in FVP-infected p53 null animals. Although PU.1 oncogene overexpression is a common mutation observed in cell lines derived from Friend virus-infected p53 wild type mice, it was not a universal finding in cell lines derived from p53 null animals. Our data conclusively demonstrate that loss of p53 function is a requirement for progression of Friend erythroleukemia in vivo. Further, the data demonstrate that erythroleukemias arising in Friend virus-infected p53 null mice are biologically and genetically distinct from those that occur in wild type animals, suggesting that the temporal order of PU.1 and p53 mutations is an important parameter in the pathogenesis of leukemic development.","['Prasher, J M', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, K S', 'Kelley, L L']","['Prasher JM', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KS', 'Kelley LL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine and the Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, UT 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mutation', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2001/06/23 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/23 10:00'],"['2000/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2001/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204395 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 May 24;20(23):2946-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204395.,,,,"['CA83984-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50DK49219/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may point to the possibility of different age-linked mechanisms that were leading to t(4;11) chromosomal translocations.","['Reichel, M', 'Gillert, E', 'Angermuller, S', 'Hensel, J P', 'Heidel, F', 'Lode, M', 'Leis, T', 'Biondi, A', 'Haas, O A', 'Strehl, S', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R', 'Griesinger, F', 'Beck, J D', 'Greil, J', 'Fey, G H', 'Uckun, F M', 'Marschalek, R']","['Reichel M', 'Gillert E', 'Angermuller S', 'Hensel JP', 'Heidel F', 'Lode M', 'Leis T', 'Biondi A', 'Haas OA', 'Strehl S', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER', 'Griesinger F', 'Beck JD', 'Greil J', 'Fey GH', 'Uckun FM', 'Marschalek R']","['Chair of Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Staudtstr. 5, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/06/23 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/23 10:00'],"['2000/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2001/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204401 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 May 24;20(23):2900-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204401.,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ408891', 'GENBANK/AJ408892', 'GENBANK/AJ408893', 'GENBANK/AJ408894', 'GENBANK/AJ408895', 'GENBANK/AJ408896', 'GENBANK/AJ408897', 'GENBANK/AJ408898', 'GENBANK/AJ408899', 'GENBANK/AJ408900', 'GENBANK/AJ408901', 'GENBANK/AJ408902', 'GENBANK/AJ408903', 'GENBANK/AJ408904', 'GENBANK/AJ408905', 'GENBANK/AJ408906', 'GENBANK/AJ408907', 'GENBANK/AJ408908', 'GENBANK/AJ408909', 'GENBANK/AJ408910', 'GENBANK/AJ408911', 'GENBANK/AJ408912', 'GENBANK/AJ408913', 'GENBANK/AJ408914', 'GENBANK/AJ408915', 'GENBANK/AJ408916', 'GENBANK/AJ408917', 'GENBANK/AJ408918', 'GENBANK/AJ408919', 'GENBANK/AJ408920', 'GENBANK/AJ408921', 'GENBANK/AJ408922', 'GENBANK/AJ408923', 'GENBANK/AJ408924', 'GENBANK/AJ408925', 'GENBANK/AJ408926', 'GENBANK/AJ408927', 'GENBANK/AJ408928', 'GENBANK/AJ408929', 'GENBANK/AJ408930', 'GENBANK/AJ408931', 'GENBANK/AJ408932', 'GENBANK/AJ408933', 'GENBANK/AJ408934', 'GENBANK/AJ408935', 'GENBANK/AJ408936', 'GENBANK/AJ408937', 'GENBANK/AJ408938', 'GENBANK/AJ408939', 'GENBANK/AJ408940', 'GENBANK/AJ408941', 'GENBANK/AJ408942', 'GENBANK/AJ408943', 'GENBANK/AJ408944', 'GENBANK/AJ408945', 'GENBANK/AJ408946', 'GENBANK/AJ408947', 'GENBANK/AJ408948', 'GENBANK/AJ408949', 'GENBANK/AJ408950', 'GENBANK/AJ408951', 'GENBANK/AJ408952', 'GENBANK/AJ408953', 'GENBANK/AJ408954', 'GENBANK/AJ408955', 'GENBANK/AJ408956']",,,,,,,

Investigation of the clonal origins of the granulocytes in the peripheral blood demonstrated that the injected donor cells contributed modestly to the granulocyte population while the majority were host-derived.

Tax, encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), has been demonstrated to induce the transformation of rat fibroblast Rat-1 cell through NF-kappaB activation. By stable transfection of Rat-1 cells with expressing constructs of Tax and its mutant M47, which is defective in HTLV-I LTR transactivation, we selected their transformed clones, which have characteristics of NF-kappaB activation and colony formation beyond the cell monolayer (a malignant phenotype). However, these two characteristics in the transformed clones of Tax and M47 disappear after these cells have been treated with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K. Further, increased activity of the PI3K/Akt is observed in the transformed clones of Tax and M47 as compared to the clones of empty vector Neo and the M148, which is defective in NF-kappaB activation and cell transformation. Increased activity of PI5K is present in the transformed clones of both Tax and M47 and in the M148 clone as compared to that in the Neo cell. It is known that the efficiency of Tax-induced cell transformation is not high; a minority of Tax-expressing clones show transformation, although the majority of Tax-expressing clones show activated NF-kappaB. A Tax-expressing, nontransformed clone after transfection with an active form of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110alpha, becomes transformed. Consistent with these results, a Tax highly-expressing human T-cell line MT2 exhibits both higher polyphosphoinositide turnover and higher activities of PI3K and PI5K than those of Jurkat or MT1 and HTLV-I-negative and a Tax-unexpressing cell line, respectively. These results demonstrate that the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, excepting for the NF-kappaB, is also required for the cell transformation induced by Tax.","['Liu, Y', 'Wang, Y', 'Yamakuchi, M', 'Masuda, S', 'Tokioka, T', 'Yamaoka, S', 'Maruyama, I', 'Kitajima, I']","['Liu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Yamakuchi M', 'Masuda S', 'Tokioka T', 'Yamaoka S', 'Maruyama I', 'Kitajima I']","['Department of Laboratory and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/pathology/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Wortmannin']",2001/06/23 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/23 10:00'],"['2000/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2000/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2001/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204364 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 May 3;20(20):2514-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204364.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large-scale production of high titre retrovirus vectors could benefit from the development of packaging cells growing in suspension. Here, we describe the ability of two different lymphoid cell lines, one B- and one T-lymphoblastoid cell line (Namalwa and CEM, respectively), to produce MLV-based vectors. Upon transfection with a third generation packaging construct, the virus particle production by Namalwa cells was characterised by low RT-activity, and by CEM cells as high RT activity as previously established adherent packaging cells. An amphotropic packaging cell line (CEMFLYA) was therefore established from CEM cells. Upon introduction of a lacZ vector genome, the novel packaging cell line produced vector particles routinely in the region of 10(7) infectious units/ml. The vectors were helper-free and highly stable in fresh human serum. The potential for scaled up vector production was demonstrated by continuous culture of the new packaging cells for 14 days in a 250 ml spinner flask. These suspension packaging cells should be applicable to large bioreactor systems to bulk produce high titre, complement-resistant retrovirus vectors for gene therapy.","['Pizzato, M', 'Merten, O W', 'Blair, E D', 'Takeuchi, Y']","['Pizzato M', 'Merten OW', 'Blair ED', 'Takeuchi Y']","['Wohl Virion Centre, Windeyer Institute of Medical Sciences, University College London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Line', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology']",2001/06/23 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/23 10:00'],"['2000/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301457 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2001 May;8(10):737-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301457.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Gene Ther 2001 Oct;8(19):1514'],,

It is a negative regulator of signal transduction induced by a number of cell receptors. Our immunohistochemical examination of paraffin-embedded reactive lymph nodes and lymphoid tissues revealed that B lymphocytes in follicle germinal centers do not express SHP-1. A weak staining of the B cells in the germinal center light zones was detected when an ultrasensitive amplification system was used. In contrast, normal B cells in mantle and marginal zones as well as interfollicular B lymphocytes and plasma cells displayed strong immunoreactivity. This pattern of SHP-1 expression was repeated in small B-cell lymphomas. All cases of mantle cell lymphoma (12 of 12), marginal zone lymphoma (10 of 10), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (13 of 13) expressed SHP-1 protein. However, only 1 of 30 cases of grade 1 follicle center cell lymphoma expressed SHP-1.

The pathologic features of lymphoma associated with HPS remain ill defined. We studied 11 lymphomas associated with HPS on initial bone marrow biopsies, consecutively diagnosed during a 6-year period in a Western institution. There were seven diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), three T-cell lymphomas (one peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified, two hepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphomas [HS gammadeltaTLs]), and one aggressive NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia (NKL). These lymphomas shared common clinicopathologic features with a systemic presentation, a poor outcome (nine patients died within 2 years), and a mild interstitial lymphoid infiltrate of the bone marrow at presentation in nine patients. This equivocal lymphoma infiltrate was blending with normal hematopoietic cells, and CD20 and CD3 immunolabelings were essential for its detection. A high number of reactive T (CD3+) cells, most often with a predominant cytotoxic (CD8+ TiA1+) phenotype, was present in all DLBCLs. By in situ hybridization, Epstein-Barr virus was detected in neoplastic cells of three cases (one DLBCL, one HS gammadeltaTL, and one NKL), which also showed serum viral DNA. Polymerase chain reaction studies disclosed HHV6 DNA sequences in tumor tissues of two DLBCLs, whereas HHV8 DNA was not detected. Because tumor mass indicative of lymphoma was not striking in most patients, bone marrow biopsy appears to be of great value for the diagnosis of an HPS-associated lymphoma, which may be, in Western patients, of B- as well as T- or NK-cell type. Immunostaining for CD3 and CD20 is essential to identify the common subtle lymphoma involvement. Together with a better understanding of the pathogenic processes, an early diagnosis may improve the prognosis of HPS-associated lymphoma.","['Allory, Y', 'Challine, D', 'Haioun, C', 'Copie-Bergman, C', 'Delfau-Larue, M H', 'Boucher, E', 'Charlotte, F', 'Fabre, M', 'Michel, M', 'Gaulard, P']","['Allory Y', 'Challine D', 'Haioun C', 'Copie-Bergman C', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Boucher E', 'Charlotte F', 'Fabre M', 'Michel M', 'Gaulard P']","['Departement de Pathologie and EA 2348, Hopital Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/isolation & purification', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*complications/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*complications/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/06/23 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/23 10:00'],"['2001/06/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-200107000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2001 Jul;25(7):865-74. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200107000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also examined the effects of OSM (0-50 ng/ml) and LIF (0-10 ng/ml) on endometrial and endometriotic stromal cell proliferation and evaluated the effects of OSM on endometrial stromal cell differentiation. The presence of 10-50 ng/ml OSM significantly suppressed endometrial stromal cell growth in secretory phase tissue but not in proliferative phase tissue. In contrast, stromal cells in endometriotic tissues were resistant to the inhibitory effects of OSM. Addition of LIF did not influence the growth of endometrial stromal cells. We also showed that 10 ng/ml OSM stimulated markers of differentiation causing increased prolactin secretion and cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression in endometrial stromal cells from the secretory phase.

Based on our previous experiences, a dose of 2.5 or 5 mg of onapristone was administered s.c. every third day during the menstrual cycle, because these dosages impair endometrial development without upsetting the normal gonadal endocrine profiles. Endometrial biopsy specimens were collected during the proliferative phase (estradiol levels about 200 pg/ml, n = 5) and peri-implantation period (Day 8 after midcycle peak in estradiol levels, n = 5) from normal ovulatory animals and during the peri-implantation period from onapristone-treated animals (n = 10). The biopsy specimens were processed to determine the expression patterns of LIF, TGFbeta2, and TGFbeta2R by immunohistochemical and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. Levels of both protein and mRNA for LIF, TGFbeta2, and TGFbeta2R (analyzed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively) were greater in the endometrial samples collected during the peri-implantation period compared to samples collected during the proliferative phase in control animals. Treatment with either of the two doses (2.5 or 5 mg) of onapristone caused a significant (P < 0.05) down-regulation in the expression of LIF in the peri-implantation endometria. The endometrial expressions of TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta2R mRNAs were reduced significantly in animals treated with 5 mg of onapristone, but not in those treated with the lower dose. However, immunoreactive TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta2R proteins were significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated in the endometrial samples from both the 2.5- and 5-mg-treated groups. The alterations observed in the expression patterns of LIF, TGFbeta2, and TGFbeta2R were specific, because the expression levels of epidermal growth factor receptor remained unaffected in the endometria from the treated groups. The present study demonstrates derangement in the expression profiles of LIF, TGFbeta2, and TGFbeta2R during the peri-implantation period in infertile bonnet monkeys. It may be hypothesized that TGFbeta2 function is one of the early steps in the regulation of the progesterone-driven cascade of events leading to endometrial receptivity, and that any aberration in this step may adversely affect the subsequent molecular events (i.e., expression of LIF). These data also suggest that potential aberrations in the functional network of locally produced cytokines and growth factors even may occur in an endometrium exposed to the optimal peripheral hormonal levels.","['Sachdeva, G', 'Patil, V', 'Katkam, R R', 'Manjramkar, D D', 'Kholkute, S D', 'Puri, C P']","['Sachdeva G', 'Patil V', 'Katkam RR', 'Manjramkar DD', 'Kholkute SD', 'Puri CP']","['Institute for Research in Reproduction, Indian Council of Medical Research, Parel, Mumbai 400 012, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', '0 (Gonanes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'H6H7G23O3N (onapristone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endometrium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/pharmacology', 'Gonanes/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infertility, Female/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Macaca radiata', 'Progesterone/blood', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis']",2001/06/23 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/06/23 10:00'],"['2001/06/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod65.1.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2001 Jul;65(1):1-8. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod65.1.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defined secretion and translocation domains of YopE were fused to the immunodominant T cell Ags listeriolysin O and p60 of Listeria monocytogenes. In vitro experiments showed that S. typhimurium allows secretion and translocation of large hybrid YopE proteins in a type III-dependent fashion. Translocation and cytosolic delivery of these chimeric proteins into host cells, but not secretion into endosomal compartments, led to efficient MHC class I-restricted Ag presentation of listerial nonamer peptides. Mice orally vaccinated with a single dose of attenuated S. typhimurium expressing translocated hybrid YopE proteins revealed high numbers of IFN-gamma-producing cells reactive with listeriolysin O 91-99 or p60 217-225, respectively. This CD8 T cell response protected mice against a challenge with L. monocytogenes.

Three of three independent CT26-specific CD4(+) hybridomas were found to recognize the high m.w. precursor of the env gene product gp90. The CD4(+) response was completely tumor specific in that the same glycoprotein expressed by other tumors was not recognized by the CT26-specific hybridomas. The recognition of gp90 by the hybridomas was strictly dependent on the conformation of gp90. Different procedures that disrupted the conformation of the glycoprotein, such as disulfide bond reduction and thermal denaturation, completely abrogated recognition of gp90 by all three hybridomas. In CT26 cells, but not in other tumor cells tested, a large proportion of gp90 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, mostly bound to the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, calreticulin. Although calreticulin was not essential for the stimulation of the gp90-specific hybridomas, most of the antigenic form of gp90 was bound to it.

Using specific antibodies, the endogenous EAF1 and ELL proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from multiple cell lines. In addition, endogenous EAF1 also exhibited the capacity to interact with ELL2. Database comparisons with EAF1 identified a region with a high content of serine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues that exhibited homology with the transcriptional activation domains of several translocation partner proteins of MLL, including AF4, LAF4, and AF5q31. A similar transcriptional activation domain has been identified in this region of EAF1. By confocal microscopy, endogenous EAF1 and ELL colocalized in a distinct nuclear speckled pattern. Transfection of the MLL-ELL fusion gene delocalized EAF1 from its nuclear speckled distribution to a diffuse nucleoplasmic pattern. In leukemic cell lines derived from mice transplanted with MLL-ELL-transduced bone marrow, EAF1 speckles were not detected.

A recent study suggested that CD38 expression has prognostic value in CLL. Peripheral blood samples from 218 patients with B-CLL were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD38 expression on CD5/19(+) leukemic cells. Various patient characteristics were studied including age, sex, Rai and Binet stages, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, hemoglobin (Hgb) level, beta-2 microglobulin (beta2M) level in the serum, number of nodal sites involved with disease, and length of survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and the log-rank statistic was used to compare these curves. CD38 was expressed in 20% or more of leukemic cells in 43% of the patients. Patients with high CD38 expression (20% or more) had significantly shorter survival times (P =.00005). Multivariate analyses showed that CD38 expression is an important prognostic factor associated with high incidence of lymph node involvement (P =.004), lower hemoglobin level (P =.001), hepatomegaly (P =.05), and high beta2M level (P =.00005). CD38 expression identified a group of patients with aggressive disease that was considered by Rai staging to be early-stage disease (Rai stages 0-II).

Clonality assessment through reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of Vbeta-Cbeta transcripts and flow cytometry with a Vbeta antibody panel covering more than 65% of Vbeta domains was validated using 28 SB-defined clonal T-cell receptor (TCR)alphabeta(+) T-ALL samples and T-cell lines. Next, the diagnostic applicability of the V(beta) RT-PCR and flow cytometric clonality assays was studied in 47 mature T-cell proliferations. Clonal Vbeta-Cbeta RT-PCR products were detected in all 47 samples, whereas single Vbeta domain usage was found in 31 (66%) of 47 patients. The suspect leukemic cell populations in the other 16 patients showed a complete lack of Vbeta monoclonal antibody reactivity that was confirmed by molecular data showing the usage of Vbeta gene segments not covered by the applied Vbeta monoclonal antibodies. Nevertheless, this could be considered indirect evidence for the ""clonal"" character of these cells. Remarkably, RT-PCR revealed an oligoclonal pattern in addition to dominant Vbeta-Cbeta products and single Vbeta domain expression in many T-LGL proliferations, providing further evidence for the hypothesis raised earlier that T-LGL derive from polyclonal and oligoclonal proliferations of antigen-activated cytotoxic T cells. It is concluded that molecular Vbeta analysis serves to assess clonality in suspect T-cell proliferations. However, the faster and cheaper Vbeta antibody studies can be used as a powerful screening method for the detection of single Vbeta domain expression, followed by molecular studies in patients with more than 20% single Vbeta domain expression or large suspect T-cell populations (more than 50%-60%) without Vbeta reactivity.","['Langerak, A W', 'van Den Beemd, R', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Boor, P P', 'van Lochem, E G', 'Hooijkaas, H', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Langerak AW', 'van Den Beemd R', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Boor PP', 'van Lochem EG', 'Hooijkaas H', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands. langerak@immu.fgg.eur.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics/immunology', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.1.165 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46906-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jul 1;98(1):165-73. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.1.165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, available methods for detecting CLL cells are either insensitive or not routinely applicable. A flow cytometric assay was developed that can differentiate CLL cells from normal B cells on the basis of their CD19/CD5/CD20/CD79b expression. The assay is rapid and can detect one CLL cell in 10(4) to 10(5) leukocytes in all patients. We have compared this assay to conventional assessment in 104 patients treated with CAMPATH-1H and/or autologous transplant. During CAMPATH-1H therapy, circulating CLL cells were rapidly depleted in responding patients, but remained detectable in nonresponders. Patients with more than 0.01 x 10(9)/L circulating CLL cells always had significant (> 5%) marrow disease, and blood monitoring could be used to time marrow assessments. In 25 out of 104 patients achieving complete remission by National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria, the detection of residual bone marrow disease at more than 0.05% of leukocytes in 6 out of 25 patients predicted significantly poorer event-free (P =.0001) and overall survival (P =.007). CLL cells are detectable at a median of 15.8 months (range, 5.5-41.8) posttreatment in 9 out of 18 evaluable patients with less than 0.05% CLL cells at end of treatment. All patients with detectable disease have progressively increasing disease levels on follow-up. The use of sensitive techniques, such as the flow assay described here, allow accurate quantitation of disease levels and provide an accurate method for guiding therapy and predicting outcome. These results suggest that the eradication of detectable disease may lead to improved survival and should be tested in future studies.","['Rawstron, A C', 'Kennedy, B', 'Evans, P A', 'Davies, F E', 'Richards, S J', 'Haynes, A P', 'Russell, N H', 'Hale, G', 'Morgan, G J', 'Jack, A S', 'Hillmen, P']","['Rawstron AC', 'Kennedy B', 'Evans PA', 'Davies FE', 'Richards SJ', 'Haynes AP', 'Russell NH', 'Hale G', 'Morgan GJ', 'Jack AS', 'Hillmen P']","['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds, United Kingdom. andy.rawstron@newscientist.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.1.29 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46889-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jul 1;98(1):29-35. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.1.29.,,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2002 Mar 1;99(5):1873-4.

We assayed donor helper T-lymphocyte precursor frequencies (HTLP(f)) to see whether they could predict the severity of GVHD and disease relapse after transplantation, thereby facilitating donor selection, pre-transplant counselling and modification of GVHD prophylaxis after BMT. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive adult BMT recipients and their HLA-identical sibling donors were recruited. HTLP((f)) was measured as a function of interleukin-2 secretion by alloreactive donor T-cells using a limiting dilution assay. Patients were followed prospectively to assess the severity of GVHD and the status of the primary disease after BMT. RESULTS: Eight donors had HTLP((f)) less than or equal to 10(-6); no recipients of these grafts developed severe GVHD after transplantation. Twenty-eight donors had HTLP(f) greater than 10(-6) and 18 recipients of these grafts developed severe GVHD (> or = grade 2) (chi(2) test, p<0.01). Seven donors had HTLP(f) greater than 10(-5) and no recipient had disease relapse.

The outcome for the patient who relapses after an autologous transplant is poor. Some of these patients achieve a remission with conventional chemotherapy, but it is usually short-lasting. Most of them succumb to the original disease. One further therapeutic possibility is an allogeneic transplant which would confer the potential advantage of a graft-versus-leukemia effect in addition to the lack of tumor contamination of the graft and to a high-dose intensity conditioning regimen. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have studied the outcome of 31 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) after failing an autologous transplant because of relapse (n=29) or persistent aplasia (n=2). The median age at allograft was 36 years (18-55) and the interval from autograft to allograft was 21 months (3-141). The source of stem-cells was unmanipulated bone marrow (n=26) or growth-factor-mobilized peripheral blood (n=5). The donor was an HLA-identical sibling (n=7), or an alternative donor (n=24) (family mismatched n=11, or matched unrelated n=13). The conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide and thiotepa (n=22), or cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (n=9) Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (CyA) + methotrexate (MTX). RESULTS: Acute GvHD was scored as 0-I, II, or III-IV in 39%, 48%, and 13% of the patients, respectively. Sixteen patients died of transplant-related complications and one of progressive disease. With a median follow-up of 220 days (9-2104) the actuarial 2-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 51%, the actuarial relapse risk 37%, the actuarial survival 46%. Fifteen patients (48%) are alive in complete remission, with a median follow-up of 32 months (range 2-71). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that patients relapsing after an autotransplant should be screened for potential related or unrelated donors: although TRM remains high there is a definite chance of long-term disease-free survival if these patients are allografted.","['di Grazia, C', 'Raiola, A M', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Gualandi, F', 'Berisso, G', 'Bregante, S', 'Dominietto, A', 'Mordini, N', 'Bruno, B', 'Frassoni, F', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['di Grazia C', 'Raiola AM', 'Van Lint MT', 'Lamparelli T', 'Gualandi F', 'Berisso G', 'Bregante S', 'Dominietto A', 'Mordini N', 'Bruno B', 'Frassoni F', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Dipartmento di Ematologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy. emato2@smartino.ge.it']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Donors', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/*standards', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):646-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of our prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility and long-term efficacy of unmanipulated ASCT followed by low-dose interferon-alpha in a homogeneous group of patients affected by CML in a very early phase of disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-six unselected consecutive patients with CML in chronic phase underwent stem cell collection at diagnosis, then received cytoreductive treatment with hydroxyurea and, subsequently, a busulphan-melphalan myeloablative regimen followed by unmanipulated stem cell graft within one year of diagnosis. Interferon was given a median of 6.5 months after transplant at escalating doses, starting from 0.5 x 10(6) IU 3 times/week, on the basis of the clinical and hematologic tolerance. RESULTS: Median chronic phase duration from diagnosis is 9 years. The ten-year projected probability of overall survival from diagnosis is 55% with a median follow-up of surviving patients of 9.5 years (8-10.5); median survival has not been reached after ten years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that high-dose therapy followed by unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and low-dose interferon-alpha is a feasible approach, which results in long-term survival in newly diagnosed CML patients. These data need to be confirmed in controlled trials comparing ASCT with other therapeutic approaches, such as the use of interferon-alpha alone or in combination with other agents.","['Meloni, G', 'Capria, S', 'Vignetti, M', 'Alimena, G', 'de Fabritiis, P', 'Montefusco, E', 'Mandelli, F']","['Meloni G', 'Capria S', 'Vignetti M', 'Alimena G', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Montefusco E', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. meloni@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):596-601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Final results of the prospective randomized PETHEMA ALL-89 TRIAL.,586-95,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of early and delayed consolidation chemotherapy on the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) stratified according to risk groups. DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1989 to 1994, 195 children (< or = 15 years old) diagnosed as having ALL (ALL-L3 excluded) in 15 Spanish hospitals entered the prospective, randomized PETHEMA ALL-89 trial. Patients were stratified into low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) groups according to their initial features and the rate of response to induction therapy. LR-ALL patients were randomized to receive or not early consolidation chemotherapy (C-1). After receiving C-1, IR patients were randomized to receive or not delayed consolidation chemotherapy (C-2). HR patients received C-1 and C-2 chemotherapy. Standard maintenance chemotherapy was administered to all patients for 2 years. High doses of intravenous methotrexate and 12 triple intrathecal doses were given as prophylaxis against central nervous system (CNS) disease. RESULTS: The mean (and standard deviation) age was 6 (4) years and 120 patients were males. Fourteen patients had early pre-B-ALL, 149 common or pre-B-ALL, and 32 T-ALL. Complete remission (CR) was attained in 189 patients (97%), 11 of whom (6%) had a slow response. Risk group stratification after CR was: LR 89, IR 50 and HR 56 patients (including a subset of 26 patients at very high risk). Ten-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) probabilities for the whole series were 58% (95% CI: 52-64%) and 69% (61-77), respectively, with a median follow-up of 8.7 years. Dividing the patients according to risk group, the 10-year EFS and OS probabilities in the LR group were 71% (63-79) and 86% (80-92), respectively; in the IR group 69% (57-81) and 76% (64-88), respectively, and in the HR group 30% (18-42) and 44% (32-57), respectively. For LR patients receiving C-1, EFS and OS were 79% (57-92) and 90% (82-98), respectively, versus 62% (48-76) and 66% (51-81) in patients not receiving C-1 (p= 0.06). For IR patients, EFS and OS were significantly improved in those receiving early and delayed consolidation (EFS 87% (74-88) vs. 52% (41-70), and OS 92% (87-97) vs. 61% (51-71)(p=0.036). Prognostic factors for EFS identified in multivariable analyses were: age >10 years in the LR group (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3-9.5, p=0.01), and treatment with C-2 in IR patients (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.4-17.8, p=0.01). The CNS relapse rate was 4% for all the series (including the HR subset). Tolerance to treatment was good. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In this study, early consolidation seemed to improve the prognosis of children with LR-ALL, but differences in EFS were not significant. Delayed consolidation had a favorable influence on the outcome of IR-ALL. CNS preventive treatment without cranial irradiation was effective in all the groups of ALL patients.","['Ortega, J J', 'Ribera, J M', 'Oriol, A', 'Bastida, P', 'Gonzalez, M E', 'Calvo, C', 'Egurbide, I', 'Hernandez Rivas, J M', 'Rivas, C', 'Alcala, A', 'Besalduch, J', 'Macia, J', 'Gardella, S', 'Carnero, M', 'Lite, J M', 'Casanova, F', 'Martinez, M', 'Fontanillas, M', 'Feliu, E', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Ortega JJ', 'Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Bastida P', 'Gonzalez ME', 'Calvo C', 'Egurbide I', 'Hernandez Rivas JM', 'Rivas C', 'Alcala A', 'Besalduch J', 'Macia J', 'Gardella S', 'Carnero M', 'Lite JM', 'Casanova F', 'Martinez M', 'Fontanillas M', 'Feliu E', 'San Miguel JF']","['Haematology Department, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain. jmribera@ns.hugtip.scs.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/standards', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):586-95.,,,"['PETHEMA Group, Spanish Society of Hematology.

Although the majority of patients in long-term clinical remission are negative by consecutive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, negative tests are still observed in patients who ultimately relapse. Conversion from negative to positive PCR has been observed after consolidation and found to be a much stronger predictor of relapse. This study reports on 47 APL patients to determine the correlation between minimal residual disease (MRD) status and clinical outcome in our cohort of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: The presence of PML-RAR alpha t transcripts was investigated in 47 APL patients (37 adults and 10 children) using a semi-nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the prognostic value of RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: All patients achieved complete clinical remission (CCR) following induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy (CHT) or ATRA alone. Patients were followed up between 2 and 117.6 months (median: 37 months). Relapses occurred in 11 patients (9 adults and 2 children) between 11.4 and 19 months after diagnosis (median: 15.1 months) while 36 patients (28 adults and 8 children) remained in CCR. Seventy-five percent of patients carried the PML-RAR alpha long isoform (bcr 1/2) which also predominated among the relapsed cases (9 of 11) but did not associate with any adverse outcome (p= 0.37). For the purpose of this analysis, minimal residual disease tests were clustered into four time-intervals: 0-2 months, 3-5 months, 6-9 months and 10-24 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Children showed persisting disease for longer than adults during the first 2 months of treatment. At 2 months, 10 (50%) of 20 patients who remained in CCR and 4 (80%) of 5 patients who subsequently relapsed were positive. Patients who remained in CCR had repeatedly negative results beyond 5.5 months from diagnosis. A positive MRD test preceded relapse in 3 of 4 tested patients. The ability of a negative test to predict CCR (predictive negative value, PNV) was greater after 6 months (>83%), while the ability of a positive test to predict relapse (predictive positive value, PPV) was most valuable only beyond 10 months (100%). This study (i) highlights the prognostic value of RT-PCR monitoring after treatment of APL patients but only from the end of treatment, (ii) shows an association between conversion to a positive test and relapse and (iii) suggests that PCR assessments should be carried out at 3-month intervals to provide a more accurate prediction of hematologic relapses but only after the end of treatment.","['Gameiro, P', 'Vieira, S', 'Carrara, P', 'Silva, A L', 'Diamond, J', 'Botelho de Sousa, A', 'Mehta, A B', 'Prentice, H G', 'Guimaraes, J E', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Foroni, L', 'Parreira, A']","['Gameiro P', 'Vieira S', 'Carrara P', 'Silva AL', 'Diamond J', 'Botelho de Sousa A', 'Mehta AB', 'Prentice HG', 'Guimaraes JE', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Foroni L', 'Parreira A']","['Department of Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):577-85.,,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):561-2.

In the light of this, the Spanish group has recently designed an external quality assessment program (EQAP) of RT-PCR detection of PML-RAR, which includes a study of sensitivity of the participating laboratories. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighteen laboratories were involved in the program. Ten laboratories followed the method of Biondi et al., 5 employed that of Borrow et al. and the 3 remaining used other protocols. The sensitivity was studied in five rounds of quality control. The first two shipments consisted of dilutions of NB4 RNA into non-APL RNA. The third round consisted of serial dilutions of the NB4 cell line into HL60 cells. The fourth and five rounds consisted of plasmid dilutions containing the bcr1 and bcr3 PML-RAR isoforms. RESULTS: The results showed that the distinct methods allow detection of the PML-RAR hybrid up to a dilution of 10(-4), and exceptionally, up to 10(-5). The laboratories following the method of Biondi et al. usually detected the 10(-3) dilution and less frequently the 10(-4) one, whereas those using other methods usually detected PML-RAR transcript in the 10(-4) dilution, and less commonly in the 10(-5) dilution. However, each of the PCR methods used by EQAP participating laboratories successfully detected at least 50 copies of PML-RAR alpha fusion transcript in plasmid dilution controls. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results point to heterogeneous sensitivity amongst participating laboratories. This may reflect differences in methodology, although variations in sample quality may also account for discrepant findings.","['Bolufer, P', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Grimwade, D', 'Barragan, E', 'Diverio, D', 'Cassinat, B', 'Chomienne, C', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Colomer, D', 'Gomez, M T', 'Marugan, I', 'Roman, J', 'Delgado, M D', 'Garcia-Marco, J A', 'Bornstein, R', 'Vizmanos, J L', 'Martinez, B', 'Jansen, J', 'Villegas, A', 'de Blas, J M', 'Cabello, P', 'Sanz, M A']","['Bolufer P', 'Lo Coco F', 'Grimwade D', 'Barragan E', 'Diverio D', 'Cassinat B', 'Chomienne C', 'Gonzalez M', 'Colomer D', 'Gomez MT', 'Marugan I', 'Roman J', 'Delgado MD', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Bornstein R', 'Vizmanos JL', 'Martinez B', 'Jansen J', 'Villegas A', 'de Blas JM', 'Cabello P', 'Sanz MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. bolufer_pas@gva.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Laboratories/*standards', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Observer Variation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Quality Control', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):570-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have indicated that the polymorphism can affect the prognosis of patients with different types of solid tumors. This study aimed to determine the relative levels of transcripts [a] and [b] in normal and malignant peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), and to investigate whether these were influenced by the polymorphism. The impact of the polymorphism on the survival of a group of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients was also to be studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: The polymorphism was genotyped, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, in 74 patients (42 MCL, 19 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 13 normal controls) and the relative level of transcripts [a] and [b] determined using a competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test were used to analyze the survival data. RESULTS: Of the cases genotyped, 39 were heterozygous for the polymorphism, 24 homozygous G and 11 homozygous A. Both transcripts [a] and [b] were expressed in normal PBMNC and malignant lymphocytes, with the polymorphism affecting their relative levels. Neither the predominant transcript, nor genotype, significantly influenced survival of the MCL patients studied. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous reports, patients who were homozygous A at the polymorphism produced more transcript [a] whilst homozygous G patients had more transcript [b]. In the small cohort studied, the polymorphism did not appear to affect the prognosis of the patients with MCL.","['Howe, D', 'Lynas, C']","['Howe D', 'Lynas C']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust, Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton, TA1 5DA, UK. denise.howe@tauntonsom-tr.swest.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):563-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in vitro usually require the use of infected cell lines, mostly to produce antigen. Two of the most widely used cell lines are FLK-BLV and BLV-bat2. OBJECTIVE: the dynamics of the excretion of BLV proteins and whole virus by the persistently BLV-infected cell lines mentioned above was studied using an indirect ELISA in combination with eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and cow and rabbit serum. STUDY DESIGN: tissue culture flasks were seeded with different concentrations of cells (13000-67000 cells per cm2, corresponding to 1-5 million cells per 75 cm2 flask) and were studied for 20 days. Samples (1.5 ml) were removed every 24 h and the presence of BLV proteins was determined using an indirect ELISA assay in which the antigen reaction with the monoclonal antibodies was evidenced by peroxidase labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulins. RESULTS: cell line FLK-BLV produced a complete monolayer as early as 4 days after passage, 3 days earlier than BLV-bat2. Using mAbs, the amount of viral proteins in the supernatant showed a cyclic pattern, with two evident peaks at days ca. 8 and 16. These peaks occurred even in the absence of passage or medium change, which causes depletion of essential nutrients and acidity. In comparison to polyclonal serum, mAbs gave more clear and defined values and are useful for determining the dynamics of viral production. CONCLUSION: when aiming for high viral yield, BLV should be harvested between days 6 and 8 after passage, when viral shedding is at its maximum. These results are very useful for preparing antigen for monoclonal antibody production, or for techniques such as ELISA or Western blot.","['Llames, L', 'Goyache, J', 'Domenech, A', 'Arjona, A', 'Suarez, G', 'Gomez-Lucia, E']","['Llames L', 'Goyache J', 'Domenech A', 'Arjona A', 'Suarez G', 'Gomez-Lucia E']","['Departmento Patologia Animal I, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense, 28040, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Vero Cells', '*Virus Latency']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1386-6532(01)00154-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s1386-6532(01)00154-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2001 Aug;22(1):31-9. doi: 10.1016/s1386-6532(01)00154-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequent occurrence of SLT-1 receptors on tumor cells derived from patients with hematological cancers (follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and their absence on human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells suggest the ex vivo use of Shiga-like toxin-1 in purging CD77(+) tumor cells from autologous stem cell transplants. SLT-1 receptors are also commonly expressed on breast cancer, ovarian cancer and astrocytoma cells. In particular, the sensitivity of astrocytoma cell lines to this toxin provides an opportunity for using SLT-1 in vivo in the context of treating patients afflicted by this common form of brain tumor. Finally, the known structural features of SLT-1 allow one to contemplate altering its receptor specificity in an effort to target CD77(-) tumor cell populations.","['Gariepy, J']",['Gariepy J'],"['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, University Health Network, 610 University Ave., Toronto, Ont., Canada, M5G 2M9. gariepy@oci.utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 1)', '0 (Trihexosylceramides)', '71965-57-6 (globotriaosylceramide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Shiga Toxin 1/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Trihexosylceramides/metabolism']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(01)00126-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00126-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2001 Jul-Aug;39(1-2):99-106. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00126-3.,,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until recently, myeloablative regimens were considered mandatory for eradication of all undesirable host-derived hematopoietic elements. Our preclinical and ongoing clinical studies indicated that much more effective eradication of host immunohematopoietic system cells could be achieved by adoptive allogeneic cell therapy with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) following BMT. Thus, eradication of blood cancer cells, especially in patients with CML can be frequently accomplished despite complete resistance of such tumor cells to maximally tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy. Our cumulative experience suggested that graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects might be a useful tool for eradication of otherwise resistant tumor cells of host origin. The latter working hypothesis suggested that effective BMT procedures may be accomplished without lethal conditioning of the host, using new well tolerated non-myeloablative regimen, thus possibly minimizing immediate and late side effects related to myeloablative procedures considered until recently mandatory for conditioning of BMT recipients. Recent clinical data that will be presented suggests that safe non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST), with no major toxicity can replace the conventional BMT. Thus, NST may provide an option for cure for a large spectrum of clinical indications in children and elderly individuals without lower or upper age limit, while minimizing procedure-related toxicity and mortality.","['Slavin, S', 'Nagler, A', 'Shapira, M', 'Panigrahi, S', 'Samuel, S', 'Or, A']","['Slavin S', 'Nagler A', 'Shapira M', 'Panigrahi S', 'Samuel S', 'Or A']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, The Danny Cunniff Leukemia Research Laboratory, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem 91120, Israel. slavin@huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(01)00121-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00121-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2001 Jul-Aug;39(1-2):25-9. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00121-4.,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of wild-type c-src, a kinase-negative c-src mutant, and v-src in microvascular endothelial cells modulated the mitogenic effect of PDGF, suggesting that c-src kinase activity inhibits PDGF signals. Analyses of cell morphology in two-dimensional culture revealed changes in cell shape and size induced by the overexpression of c-src proteins. Investigations in three-dimensional culture unveiled a modulatory role of c-src during in vitro angiogenesis. Overexpression of c-src resulted in an increased diameter of tube-like structures, and the number of branching segments was decreased. Expression of the kinase-negative c-src mutant resulted in abortive tube formation consisting of disconnected multicellular fragments.

A mutation of Sxr(a) was discovered in a cross between an Sxr carrier male and a T16H/X female. This was designated Sxr(b) and found to affect both the expression of HY and spermatogenesis, but not testis differentiation, thereby disproving Ohno's hypothesis that HY controlled testis determination. Molecular genetic analysis showed the mutation to be caused by fusion of two duplicated genes, Zfy1 and Zfy2, deleting the intervening DNA. This deletion interval, deltaSxr(b), contained a number of genes, each a candidate HY gene. Expression cloning with HY-specific T cell clones identified Smcy, Uty and Dby as encoding peptide epitopes of this transplantation antigen. The human homologues SMCY and UTY likewise express HY antigens and these are targets of damaging graft-versus-host (GVH) responses and potentially therapeutic graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) responses following bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

However, no minimally deleted region in the 13q arm has been defined at 13q, and consequently no tumor suppressor genes have yet been identified that are important for disease pathogenesis. We attempted to characterize these chromosome 13q deletions at the molecular cytogenetic level. We studied 351 newly diagnosed patients, entered into the E9486/E9487 clinical study of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with immune fluorescent detection (cIg-FISH) of clonal plasma cells (PC) and cytomorphology were used to analyze interphase, bone marrow (BM) cell, cytospin slides. We simultaneously used DNA probes for the following locus specific probes (LSI); LSI 13 (Rb) and D13S319, which hybridize to 13q14. We subsequently studied distal deletions using the D13S25 probe (13q14.3) and a subtelomeric probe (13qSTP) for the 13q-arm (D13S327) in 40 cases with documented LSI 13 (Rb)/D13S319 deletion and 40 without deletion of these loci. Of 325 evaluable patients, we found 13q deletions in 176 (54%) using LSI 13 (Rb) and D13S319 probes. Of 40 patients with LSI 13 (Rb)/D13S319 deletions, 34 (85%) had coexistent deletion of both D13S25/13qSTP. These results indicate that chromosome 13 deletions in MM involve loss of most if not all of the 13q arm perhaps even indicating monosomy. In six cases the 13qSTP signal was conserved, but D13S25 was lost indicating large interstitial deletions involving 13q14. In 39 of the 40 cases without LSI 13 (Rb)/D13S319 deletions, the normal pattern of two pairs of signals was observed for D13S25/13qSTP. Deletions involving 13q14 are very common in MM as detected by cIg-FISH. These deletions appear to predominantly involve loss of large segments of the 13q arm or monosomy 13, and only occasionally represent an interstitial deletion.","['Fonseca, R', 'Oken, M M', 'Harrington, D', 'Bailey, R J', 'Van Wier, S A', 'Henderson, K J', 'Kay, N E', 'Van Ness, B', 'Greipp, P R', 'Dewald, G W']","['Fonseca R', 'Oken MM', 'Harrington D', 'Bailey RJ', 'Van Wier SA', 'Henderson KJ', 'Kay NE', 'Van Ness B', 'Greipp PR', 'Dewald GW']","['Mayo Clinic Department of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/ultrastructure', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Sequence Deletion']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402125 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):981-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402125.,,,,"['CA21115-25C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83724-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 31 patients affected by MMM and in 12 healthy subjects we evaluated the serum levels of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and correlated VEGF with clinical and laboratory features of disease. We found that MMM patients had circulating VEGF concentrations much higher than controls (Median 1208 ng/ml vs 138 ng/ml, P < 0.0001). No correlation was found between VEGF and Hb, WBC, PLT, LDH, creatinine, bone marrow cellularity, fibrosis, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and therapy. However, in the subgroup of patients with a normal or low VEGF concentration, a direct correlation between VEGF and platelet count (r = 0.90, P = 0.002) was detected. Moreover, patients with a platelet count < 300 x 10(9)/l had VEGF serum levels lower than patients with a higher PLT count (median VEGF 864 vs 1557 pg/ml, P = 0.001). In six patients and in eight controls we also had the opportunity to measure VEGF in the plasma and we calculated that VEGF concentration was much higher in platelet-rich than in platelet-poor plasma and that platetets of MMM patients contained four times more VEGF than those of healthy controls. These results indicate that VEGF is overproduced in MMM, thus confirming an increased angiogenic activity.

We report on a 16-month-old child with erythroleukaemia (AML-M6), whose marrow karyotype at onset was 48,XX,del(13)(q12q14),del(14)(q22q32),+21,+21. The parental origin of the supernumerary chromosomes 21 was investigated by comparing 10 polymorphic loci scattered along the whole chromosome on the patient's marrow and her parents' leukocytes. Three loci were informative for the presence of three alleles, two of which were of maternal origin; two further loci showed a maternal allele of higher intensity. Lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts showed a normal karyotype, and molecular analysis on leukocytes at remission, buccal smear and urinary sediment cells consistently showed only one maternal allele, whereas neonatal blood from Guthrie spot showed two maternal alleles as in the marrow. An accurate clinical re-evaluation confirmed a normal phenotype. Our results indicate that tetrasomy 21 arose from a marrow clone with trisomy 21 of meiotic origin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that supernumerary chromosomes in neoplastic clones may in fact be present due to a meiotic error. This demonstrates that a tissue-confined constitutional mosaicism for a trisomy may indeed represent the first event in multistep carcinogenesis.","['Minelli, A', 'Morerio, C', 'Maserati, E', 'Olivieri, C', 'Panarello, C', 'Bonvini, L', 'Leszl, A', 'Rosanda, C', 'Lanino, E', 'Danesino, C', 'Pasquali, F']","['Minelli A', 'Morerio C', 'Maserati E', 'Olivieri C', 'Panarello C', 'Bonvini L', 'Leszl A', 'Rosanda C', 'Lanino E', 'Danesino C', 'Pasquali F']","['Biologia Generale e Genetica Medica, Universita di Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dermatoglyphics', 'Down Syndrome/genetics', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/chemistry/cytology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/therapy', '*Meiosis', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mosaicism/*genetics', 'Nondisjunction, Genetic', '*Trisomy']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402123 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):971-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402123.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study two genes, PURA and PURB, encoding functionally cooperative proteins in the Pur family, are localized to chromosome bands 5q31.1 and 7p13, respectively. One or both of these loci are shown to be hemizygously deleted in 60 MDS or AML patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). High-resolution mapping of PURA localizes it approximately 1.1 Mb telomeric to the EGR-1 gene. Frequency of PURA deletion and segregation with EGR-1 indicate that PURA is within the most commonly deleted segment in myeloid disorders characterized by del(5)(q31). No mutations have been detected within the coding sequence of PURA. Concurrent deletions of PURA and PURB occur in MDS at a rate nearly 1.5-fold higher than statistically expected and in AML at a rate > 5-fold higher. This novel simultaneous deletion of two closely related gene family members may thus have consequences related to progression to AML. Pur alpha, an Rb-binding protein, has been implicated in cell cycle control and differentiation, and Pur alpha and Pur beta are reported to function as heterodimers. Alterations in these genes could affect a delicate balance critical in myeloid development.","['Lezon-Geyda, K', 'Najfeld, V', 'Johnson, E M']","['Lezon-Geyda K', 'Najfeld V', 'Johnson EM']","['Department of Pathology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Derald H Ruttenberg Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PURA protein, human)', '0 (PURB protein, human)', '0 (Pura protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Library', 'Genotype', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402108 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):954-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402108.,,,,['CA55219/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied platelet lifespan in 61 MDS cases with platelets < 70,000/mm3 and marrow blasts < 10%. Nine of them (15%) had a major platelet lifespan reduction (< 3.5 days), and were considered for splenectomy. Three of them were not splenectomized due to rapid death, patient refusal and older age plus liver predominance of platelet sequestration, respectively. The remaining six patients (two females and four males, median age 50 years, range 32 to 65) were splenectomized 3 to 21 months after diagnosis. Before splenectomy, five of them had RA and one had CMML. Platelets counts ranged from 5000 to 30,000/mm3 and did not durably respond to other treatments. Three of the patients has a relapse of platelet counts, concomitantly required platelet transfusion due to recurrent blending, whereas three had anemia (two required erythrocyte transfusion) and four had neutropenia. Three months after surgery, platelet counts ranged from 55,000 to 160,000/mm3 (> 100,000/mm3 in four cases), no patient required platelet or erythrocyte transfusion, but there was no effect on neutrophil counts. Three patients had a relapse of platelet counts, concomitant with progression to AML in two of them, whereas the third relapsing case achieved normal platelet counts with further danazol. One patient died with normal platelet counts 12 months after splenectomy (from sepsis, probably related to neutropenia rather than splenectomy). Two patients remained with normal platelet counts 10 and 52 months after surgery. Our findings suggest that the mechanism of thrombocytopenia should be studied more often in 'low risk' MDS (i.e. with low bone marrow blast counts) with thrombocytopenia, as about 15% of them appear to have peripheral platelet destruction. Some of those patients may benefit from splenectomy.","['Bourgeois, E', 'Caulier, M T', 'Rose, C', 'Dupriez, B', 'Bauters, F', 'Fenaux, P']","['Bourgeois E', 'Caulier MT', 'Rose C', 'Dupriez B', 'Bauters F', 'Fenaux P']","['Service des Maladies du Sang CHU Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'N29QWW3BUO (Danazol)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood/drug therapy/surgery', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/drug therapy/surgery', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Danazol/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-3/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Platelet Count', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/etiology"", '*Splenectomy/adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Treatment Refusal', 'Vasculitis/etiology']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402129 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):950-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402129.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed growth inhibition and SMAD2 phosphorylation by TGF beta in CD34+ cells from nine patients, as compared to normal controls. While TGF beta consistently inhibited thymidine incorporation of normal cells (41% of control, P < 0.05), cells from patients with AML were growth-inhibited in only four of seven cases (40%), whereas TGF beta stimulated thymidine incorporation in the three other samples (166%). Remarkably, TPO reverted the stimulatory effect of TGF beta to profound growth inhibition. Upon exposure to TGF beta, SMAD2 protein was phosphorylated in normal CD34+ cells (n = 3), CD34+ leukemic blasts from all examined patients with AML (n = 4), and in the myeloid leukemic cell lines M-07e and HEL. TGF beta inhibited TPO-mediated thymidine incorporation, cell proliferation and survival in all samples analyzed. In M-07e cells and CD34+ cells from healthy donors, this inhibition was enhanced by an antagonist of JAK2 (AG490), but not a MEK-1 antagonist (PD098059). Conversely, in CD34+ cells from a patient with AML, both AG490 and PD098059 significantly enhanced TGF beta-mediated suppression of TPO-induced thymidine incorporation. Thus, in MDS-derived AML, altered responses to TGF beta may be due to defects downstream of SMAD2 and may involve MAPK activation.","['Koschmieder, S', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Kunert, J', 'Wagner, S', 'Ballas, K', 'Seipelt, G', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Kalina, U']","['Koschmieder S', 'Hofmann WK', 'Kunert J', 'Wagner S', 'Ballas K', 'Seipelt G', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG', 'Kalina U']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402119 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):942-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of multidrug resistance further limits chemotherapy in cancer. Here, I show that multidrug resistance can be exploited for selective killing of multidrug-resistant cells by a combination of an apoptosis-inducing agent that is not a substrate of either Pgp or MRP (e.g. flavopiridol) with a caspase inhibitor that is a substrate (e.g. Z-DEVD-fmk). In normal cells, treatment with caspase inhibitors prevented PARP cleavage, nuclear fragmentation, and cell death caused by flavopiridol or epothilone B. In contrast, Pgp- and MRP-expressing cells were not rescued by caspase inhibitors. Furthermore, reversal of drug resistance renders Pgp cells sensitive to caspase inhibitors abolishing therapeutic advantage. Thus, caspase inhibitors, that are inactive in multidrug-resistant cells, protect normal but not multidrug-resistant cells against chemotherapy, permitting selective eradication of multidrug-resistant cells. Clinical application of this approach may diminish the toxic side-effects of chemotherapy in patients with multidrug-resistant tumors.","['Blagosklonny, M V']",['Blagosklonny MV'],"['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Building 10, R 12N226 NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Epothilones)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-valyl-aspartyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'UEC0H0URSE (epothilone B)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Epothilones', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402127 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):936-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, high level cross-resistance to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was encountered in a childhood ALL cell line selected for resistance to methotrexate (CEM MTX-R3). Compared with wild-type (WT) CEM cells, MTX-R3 cells had significantly fewer glucocorticoid binding sites, as well as reduced glucocorticoid receptor protein and mRNA levels. DNA sequencing and restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis showed that WT cells expressed both a wild-type and a mutant (GR753F) glucocorticoid receptor allele, while MTX-R3 cells expressed only the GR753F allele. Therefore, the cross-resistance of MTX-R3 cells to dexamethasone appeared due to loss of expression of the wild-type glucocorticoid receptor allele. In an effort to gain insight into the underlying basis for the development of cross-resistance to methotrexate and glucocorticoids, glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation experiments were carried out. Exposure of WT cells to either dexamethasone or the cytotoxic agents cytarabine and methotrexate caused translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. These data indicate that exposure of childhood ALL cells to cytotoxic agents may result in ligand-independent glucocorticoid receptor activation which, in the context of the outgrowth of drug-resistant cells, could lead to the co-selection of glucocorticoid resistance.","['Catts, V S', 'Farnsworth, M L', 'Haber, M', 'Norris, M D', 'Lutze-Mann, L H', 'Lock, R B']","['Catts VS', 'Farnsworth ML', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Lutze-Mann LH', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402128 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):929-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402128.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore examined 129 cell samples from patients with de novo acute leukemia as to their constitutive susceptibility to TRAIL-induced apoptosis In vitro. Only 21 (16%) cell samples revealed at least 10% TRAIL-susceptible cells/sample as detected by flow cytometric annexinV staining after 24 h culture compared with medium control. Precursor B cell ALL samples (11 (27%) of 41) were more TRAIL-susceptible compared with AML (5 (9%) of 54; P < 0.05) but not compared with precursor T cell ALL (5 (15%) of 34; P = 0.20). Furthermore, we examined constitutive mRNA expression levels of TRAIL receptors R1-R4 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (n = 58). Expression levels were heterogeneous, however, there was no significant correlation between the expression of the signal-transducing receptors (R1, R2) as well as of the decoy receptors (R3, R4) and TRAIL sensitivity in this series. Constitutive NF-kappa B activity has been shown to influence TRAIL susceptibility of leukemic cells. In 39 leukemic cell samples examined, we found a generally high NF-kappa B activity as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay which did not differ between TRAIL-susceptible and TRAIL-resistant cases. Finally, 49 acute leukemic cell samples were coincubated with doxorubicin in vitro. Doxorubicin sensitized four of 35 initially TRAIL-resistant samples and augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis in two of 14 TRAIL-susceptible samples. In summary, constitutive TRAIL susceptibility differs between leukemia subtypes and does not correlate with mRNA expression levels of the TRAIL receptors R1-R4 as well as constitutive NF-kappa B activation status. The observed sensitization of leukemic cells to TRAIL by doxorubicin in vitro indicates that TRAIL should be further evaluated as to its possible role as an in vivo cotherapeutic in acute leukemia.","['Wuchter, C', 'Krappmann, D', 'Cai, Z', 'Ruppert, V', 'Scheidereit, C', 'Dorken, B', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Karawajew, L']","['Wuchter C', 'Krappmann D', 'Cai Z', 'Ruppert V', 'Scheidereit C', 'Dorken B', 'Ludwig WD', 'Karawajew L']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle-Clinic, Charite, Humboldt-University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402131 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):921-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402131.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five patients with a t(7;12) were from a group of 125 successfully karyotyped pediatric patients enrolled in consecutive clinical AML trials of the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group over a period of 7 years. During a search of available cytogenetic databases, we found 7q and 12p abnormalities in two additional Dutch patients and in three participants in Pediatric Oncology Group trials. A del(12p) had been initially identified in four of these patients and re-examination of the original karyograms revealed a t(7;12)(q36;p13) in two instances and a probable t(7;12) in the other two. FISH confirmed the presence of a t(7;12)(q36;p13) in the latter. Most (n = 7) also had trisomy 19. The t(7;12)(q36;p13) (n = 9) was more common than the t(7;12)(q32;p13) (n = 1). These subtle translocations were found only in children 18 months of age or younger. A literature search revealed that the t(7;12) with break-points at 7q31-q36 and 12p12-p13 had been reported in six children with myeloid disorders and in two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; all were 12 months of age or younger. Only two of the 17 for whom survival data were available, were alive after at least 22 months of continuous complete remission. Our findings suggest that ETV6 rearrangements due to a t(7;12) may play an adverse role in myeloid disorders in children 18 months of age or younger. Therefore, children in this age group with myeloid disorders should be screened for both MLL and ETV6 rearrangements.","['Slater, R M', 'von Drunen, E', 'Kroes, W G', 'Weghuis, D O', 'van den Berg, E', 'Smit, E M', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'van Wering, E', 'Hahlen, K', 'Carroll, A J', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Beverloo, H B']","['Slater RM', 'von Drunen E', 'Kroes WG', 'Weghuis DO', 'van den Berg E', 'Smit EM', 'van der Does-van den Berg A', 'van Wering E', 'Hahlen K', 'Carroll AJ', 'Raimondi SC', 'Beverloo HB']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Introns/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402121 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):915-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402121.,,,,"['CA 25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",29,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients received three types of induction/consolidation regimen: standard (daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside (3/7); two cycles); intensive (idarubicin, cytosine arabinoside and etoposide (ICE), plus mitoxantrone and intermediate-dose Ara-C (NOVIA)); and low-dose (low-dose cytosine arabinoside). CR patients under 60 years of age, if an HLA-identical donor was available received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT); otherwise, as part of the program, they underwent autologous (auto)-SCT. CR rates significantly associated with 'favorable' (inv(16), t(8;21)), 'intermediate' ('no abnormality', abn(11q23), +8, del(7q)) and 'unfavorable' (del (5q), -7, abn(3)(q21q26), t(6;9), 'complex' (more than three unrelated cytogenetic abnormalities)) karyotypes (88% vs 65% vs 36%, respectively; P = 0.0001). These trends were confirmed in all age groups. On therapeutic grounds, intensive induction did not determine significant increases of CR rates in any of the considered groups, with respect to standard induction. Low-dose induction was associated with significantly lower CR rates. Considering disease-free survival (DFS), multivariate analysis of the factors examined (including karyotype grouping) showed that only age > 60 years significantly affected outcome. However, in cases where intensive induction was adopted, 'favorable' karyotype was significantly related to longer DFS (P = 0.04). This was mainly due to the favorable outcome of t(8;21) patients treated with intensive induction. Patients receiving allo-SCT had significantly longer DFS (P = 0.005); in particular, allo-SCT significantly improved DFS in the 'favorable' and 'intermediate' groups (P = 0.04 and P = 0.048, respectively). In conclusion our study could provide some guidelines for AML therapy: (1) patients in the 'favorable' karyotype group seem to have a longer DFS when treated with an intensive induction/consolidation regimen, adopted before auto-SCT instead of standard induction; this underlines the importance of reinforcement of chemotherapy, not necessarily based on repeated high-dose AraC cycles. Allo-SCT, independently of induction/consolidation therapy, should be considered an alternative treatment; (2) patients in the 'intermediate' karyotype group should receive allo-SCT; (3) patients in the 'unfavorable' karyotype group should be treated using investigational chemotherapy, considering that even allo-SCT cannot provide a significantly longer DFS, but only a trend to a better prognosis.","['Visani, G', 'Bernasconi, P', 'Boni, M', 'Castoldi, G L', 'Ciolli, S', 'Clavio, M', 'Cox, M C', 'Cuneo, A', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Dini, D', 'Falzetti, D', 'Fanin, R', 'Gobbi, M', 'Isidori, A', 'Leoni, F', 'Liso, V', 'Malagola, M', 'Martinelli, G', 'Mecucci, C', 'Piccaluga, P P', 'Petti, M C', 'Rondelli, R', 'Russo, D', 'Sessarego, M', 'Specchia, G', 'Testoni, N', 'Torelli, G', 'Mandelli, F', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Bernasconi P', 'Boni M', 'Castoldi GL', 'Ciolli S', 'Clavio M', 'Cox MC', 'Cuneo A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Dini D', 'Falzetti D', 'Fanin R', 'Gobbi M', 'Isidori A', 'Leoni F', 'Liso V', 'Malagola M', 'Martinelli G', 'Mecucci C', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Petti MC', 'Rondelli R', 'Russo D', 'Sessarego M', 'Specchia G', 'Testoni N', 'Torelli G', 'Mandelli F', 'Tura S']","['Seragnoli Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Validation Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4', 'NOAC protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human/ultrastructure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatomegaly/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402142 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):903-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402142.,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gram negative infection (9 vs 1 gram negative septicemia, P = 0.01) and infection-related deaths (6 vs 1 deaths, P = NS) occurred more frequently in the CI arm during the induction treatment than in the i.v. arm, leading to the study interruption.

The MR imaging findings of 17 of the 116 participating patients were consistent with AVNB. The most common clinical manifestation was joint pain (11 patients). Only one patient had progressive joint deterioration that necessitated surgical replacement. Only age 10 years or more at the time of the primary diagnosis was significantly associated with the development of AVNB (P = 0.004).

However, these compounds differ in regard to the types of transporters that most efficiently transport a given compound, and their preferential interaction with certain targets which may explain why some compounds are more effective against rapidly proliferating tumors and others on neoplasia with a more protracted evolution. In this review, we analyze the available data concerning mechanisms of action of and resistance to NA, with particular emphasis on recent advances in the characterization of nucleoside transporters and on the potential role of activating or inactivating enzymes in the induction of clinical resistance to these compounds. We performed an extensive search of published in vitro and clinical data in which the levels of expression of nucleoside-activating or inactivating enzymes have been correlated with tumor response or patient outcome. Strategies aiming to increase the intracellular concentrations of active compounds are presented.","['Galmarini, C M', 'Mackey, J R', 'Dumontet, C']","['Galmarini CM', 'Mackey JR', 'Dumontet C']","['Unite INSERM 453, Laboratoire de Cytologie Analytique, Faculte de Medecine Rockefeller, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.113 (deoxyguanosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)"", 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', ""5'-Nucleotidase/metabolism"", 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dioxolanes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402114 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):875-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402114.,,,,,246,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the 'mitotic arrest-induced' model, multi-site phosphorylation of the BcI-2 loop domain is followed by cell death. In contrast, in cytokine-dependent cell lines, cytokines mediate phosphorylation of BcI-2 on S70, preventing apoptosis. As discussed in this review, these models are not mutually exclusive but reflect different cellular contexts. During mitotic arrest, signal transduction is unique and is fundamentally different from classical mitogenic signaling, since the nucleus membrane is dissolved, gene expression is reduced, and numerous kinases and regulatory proteins are hyperphosphorylated. Hyperphosphorylation of BcI-2 mediated by paclitaxel and other microtubule-active drugs is strictly dependent on targeting microtubules that in turn cause mitotic arrest. In addition to serine-70 (S70), microtubule-active agents promote phosphorylation of S87 and threonine-69 (T69), inactivating BcI-2. A major obstacle for identification of the mitotic BcI-2 kinase(s) is that inhibition of putative kinase(s) by any means (dominant-negative mutants, antisense oligonucleotides, pharmacological agents) may arrest cycle, preventing mitosis and BcI-2 phosphorylation. The role of BcI-2 phosphorylation in cell death is discussed.","['Blagosklonny, M V']",['Blagosklonny MV'],"['Medicine Branch, Building 10, R 12N226, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Mitosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/06/22 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402134 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jun;15(6):869-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402134.,,,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depolarisation with K+ caused a rapid rise in Ca2+ concentration in the PC12 cells, followed by a delayed secondary Ca2+ response in simultaneously monitored nearby HEL cells. There was a lag period of about 20 s between the responses of the two cell types. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in PC12 cells were inhibited by the P/Q-type (omega-conotoxin MVIIC, omega-agatoxin IVA), N-type (omega-conotoxin GVIA) and L-type channel blockers (nifedipine) as determined using fura-2 or whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The communication between the cell types on the other hand was sensitive to P/Q- and N-type but not to L-type channel blockers. This suggests that, as in neurons, P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels mediate the release of neurotransmitters acting on HEL cells. Theoretically, the procedure employed should be sensitive enough to detect single exocytotic events. Our results demonstrate that a random distribution between effector and target cells is sufficient to allow communication between cells in a manner similar to extrasynaptic transmission.","['Shariatmadari, R', 'Lund, P E', 'Krijukova, E', 'Sperber, G O', 'Kukkonen, J P', 'Akerman, K E']","['Shariatmadari R', 'Lund PE', 'Krijukova E', 'Sperber GO', 'Kukkonen JP', 'Akerman KE']","['Department of Physiology, Division of Cell Physiology, Uppsala University, BMC, PO Box 572, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/physiology', '*Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Electrophysiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Nerve Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism/physiology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'PC12 Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Synaptic Transmission/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/06/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004240000513 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 2001 May;442(2):312-20. doi: 10.1007/s004240000513.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CML66 encodes a 583-aa protein with a molecular mass of 66 kDa and no significant homology to other known genes. CML66 gene is localized to human chromosome 8q23, but the function of this gene is unknown. CML66 is expressed in leukemias and a variety of solid tumor cell lines. When examined by Northern blot, expression in normal tissues was restricted to testis and heart, and no expression was found in hematopoietic tissues. When examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, expression in CML cells was 1.5-fold higher than in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of CML66-specific antibody in patient serum was confirmed by Western blot and the development of high titer IgG antibody specific for CML66 correlated with immune induced remission of CML in a patient who received infusion of normal donor lymphocytes for treatment of relapse. CML66 antibody also was found in sera from 18-38% of patients with lung cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer. These findings suggest that CML66 may be immunogenic in a wide variety of malignancies and may be a target for antigen-specific immunotherapy.","['Yang, X F', 'Wu, C J', 'McLaughlin, S', 'Chillemi, A', 'Wang, K S', 'Canning, C', 'Alyea, E P', 'Kantoff, P', 'Soiffer, R J', 'Dranoff, G', 'Ritz, J']","['Yang XF', 'Wu CJ', 'McLaughlin S', 'Chillemi A', 'Wang KS', 'Canning C', 'Alyea EP', 'Kantoff P', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Dranoff G', 'Ritz J']","[""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (NUDCD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/blood/*genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Organ Specificity', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Testis/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/21 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/21 10:00'],"['2001/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.131590998 [doi]', '98/13/7492 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jun 19;98(13):7492-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.131590998.,PMC34696,,,"['K08 HL004293/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8 HL04293/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AF283301'],,,,,,,

In an attempt to identify a cellular CBE-binding protein(s) that may be involved in apoptosis regulation in mammals, multiple nuclear binding complexes of CBE were identified in various mammalian cell lines and tissues by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cyclic AMP (cAMP)-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) was present in one major CBE complex of Ba/F3 and TF-1 cells, and both in vitro-translated and Escherichia coli-synthesized CREB bound to CBE. Activation of CREB by cAMP-elevating chemicals or the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc) resulted in induction of the CBE-driven reporter gene. Stimulation of Ba/F3 cells with interleukin-3 (IL-3) promptly induced phosphorylation of CREB at serine(133) partially via a PKA-dependent pathway. Consistently, Ba/F3 cell survival in the absence of IL-3 was prolonged by activation of PKA. Conversely, treatment of cells with a PKA inhibitor or expression of the dominant negative forms of the regulatory subunit type I of PKA and CREB overrode the survival activity of IL-3. Last, the bcl-2 gene was demonstrated to be one candidate cellular target of the CREB-containing CBE complex, as mutations in the CRE and CBE sites significantly reduced the IL-3 inducibility of the bcl-2 promoter.

Although the initial remission rate is quite high, relapse and associated drug resistance are a significant problem. In vitro studies have demonstrated increased asparagine synthetase (AS) expression in ASNase-resistant cells, which has led to the hypothesis that elevated AS activity permits drug-resistant survival. The data presented show that not only is elevated AS expression a property of ASNase-resistant MOLT-4 human leukaemia cells, but that short-term (12 h) treatment of the cells with ASNase causes a relatively rapid induction of AS expression. The results also document that the elevated expression of AS in ASNase-resistant cells is not fully reversible, even 6 weeks after ASNase removal from the culture medium. Furthermore, ASNase resistance, assessed as both drug-insensitive cell growth rates and decreased drug-induced apoptosis, parallels this irreversible AS expression. Mimicking the elevated AS activity in ASNase-resistant cells by overexpression of the human AS protein by stable retroviral transformation of parental MOLT4 cells is sufficient to induce the ASNase-resistance phenotype. These data document that ASNase resistance in ALL cells is a consequence of elevated AS expression and that although other drug-induced metabolic changes occur, they are secondary to the increased asparagine biosynthetic rate.","['Aslanian, A M', 'Fletcher, B S', 'Kilberg, M S']","['Aslanian AM', 'Fletcher BS', 'Kilberg MS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Box 100245, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610-0245, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Asparaginase/*toxicity', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/21 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/06/21 10:00'],"['2001/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0264-6021:3570321 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Jul 1;357(Pt 1):321-8. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3570321.,PMC1221958,,,['DK-52064/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that protein phosphorylation by various kinases is not required for the activation of the store-operated Ca2+ current in RBL cells.","['Bodding, M']",['Bodding M'],"['University Laboratory of Physiology, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '3Y0G32G2RV (lavendustin A)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/21 10:00'],"['2001/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002100100420 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2001 Jun;363(6):633-8. doi: 10.1007/s002100100420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TF may be expressed on the surface of various cells including monocytes and endothelial cells. Over-expression of TF in human tumor cell lines promotes metastasis. We recently showed that hemoglobin (Hb) forms a specific complex with TF purified from human malignant melanoma cells and enhances its procoagulant activity (PCA). To further study this interaction, we examined the effect of Hb on the expression of TF on human malignant (TF+) cells and KG1 myeloid leukemia (TF-) cells. Human melanoma A375 and J82 bladder carcinoma cells, which express TF at moderate and relatively high levels, respectively, were incubated with varying concentrations (0-1.5 mg/ml) of Hb. After washing, cells were analyzed for Hb binding and TF expression using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Hb bound to the cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and increased both TF expression and PCA. The human A375 malignant melanoma cells incubated with Hb (1 mg/ml) expressed up to six times more TF antigen than cells without Hb. This increase in TF expression and PCA of intact cells incubated with Hb was significantly inhibited by cycloheximide at a concentration of 10 microg/ml (P < 0.01). An increase in total cellular TF antigen content was demonstrated by specific immunoassay. In contrast, Hb (5 mg/ml) did not induce TF expression and PCA on KG1 cells as determined by flow cytometry and TF (FXAA) activity. We conclude that Hb specifically binds to TF-bearing malignant cells and increases their PCA. This effect seems to be at least partly due to de novo synthesis of TF and increased surface expression. However, the exact mechanism by which Hb binds and upregulates TF expression remains to be determined.","['Siddiqui, F A', 'Amirkhosravi, A', 'Amaya, M', 'Meyer, T', 'Biggerstaff, J', 'Desai, H', 'Francis, J L']","['Siddiqui FA', 'Amirkhosravi A', 'Amaya M', 'Meyer T', 'Biggerstaff J', 'Desai H', 'Francis JL']","['Clinical and Research Laboratories, Walt Disney Memorial Cancer Institute, Florida Hospital, Orlando 32804, USA.

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Adult intensive care unit (ICU) at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. PATIENTS: One patient with mucositis secondary to chemotherapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A 37-yr-old female with recently diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia was admitted to the ICU with mental status changes and progressive dyspnea requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Before ICU admission, the patient had suffered from painful mucositis causing severe dysphagia and bleeding, which was thought to be the result of chemotherapy. By the 10th ICU day, the patient's respiratory and mental status improved and the patient was successfully extubated. However, 8 hrs after extubation, she gradually developed severe respiratory distress, requiring reintubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient was given 14 mg of etomidate and 100 mg of succinylcholine intravenously. Immediately after the intubation, she suffered cardiac arrest. Her serum potassium level was 13.1 mEq/L and HCO3- was 16 mEq/L. The resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, and the patient was pronounced dead. CONCLUSION: Oral mucositis is a frequent and potentially severe complication of cancer chemotherapy. We believe that mucositis was a contributing factor to this case of fatal hyperkalemia after administration of succinylcholine, with a mechanism similar to that reported with thermal injury. Only nondepolarizing muscle relaxants should be used in patients who are at risk for mucositis. Mucositis should be added to the list of conditions in which succinylcholine is contraindicated.","['Al-Khafaji, A H', 'Dewhirst, W E', 'Cornell, C J Jr', 'Quill, T J']","['Al-Khafaji AH', 'Dewhirst WE', 'Cornell CJ Jr', 'Quill TJ']","['Section of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neuromuscular Depolarizing Agents)', 'J2R869A8YF (Succinylcholine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperkalemia/*chemically induced/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Neuromuscular Depolarizing Agents/*adverse effects', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/therapy', 'Stomatitis/*chemically induced', 'Succinylcholine/*adverse effects']",2001/06/21 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/21 10:00'],"['2001/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-200106000-00040 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2001 Jun;29(6):1274-6. doi: 10.1097/00003246-200106000-00040.,,,,,,,,,['Crit Care Med. 2002 Jul;30(7):1674-5.

In this study, the authors investigated the frequency and prognostic significance of p15 and p16 gene methylation in adult acute leukemia. METHOD: The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) was used to analyze p15 and p16 gene methylation in 49 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 29 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). RESULTS: At presentation, 93 % of cases of AML (8 of 8 M1, 10 of 11 M2, 2 of 2 M4, 5 of 6 M5, and 2 of 2 M6; French-American-British classification system) showed p15 methylation, but none showed p16 methylation. In ALL, 57% (5 of 8 T-ALL, 16 of 30 common-ALL, 6 of 7 pre-B ALL, and 1 of 4 early B-precursor ALL) showed p15 methylation. Only 6% showed p16 methylation, all of whom had concomitant p15 methylation. One patient acquired p16 methylation during relapse. In 23 ALL karyotyped cases, p15 methylation was found in 6 of 9 cases with normal karyotype, 3 of 7 cases with the Philadelphia chromosome, 3 of 5 cases with complex, 1 with hyperdiploidy, and 1 with trisomy 21. Three more cases with unsuccessful karyotyping but bcr/abl fusion showed p15 methylation as well. Five ALL patients were tested serially for minimal residual disease (MRD) with MS-PCR that has a sensitivity of 10(-4) to 10(-5). All showed continuous positive MS-PCR that heralded hematologic relapse. The prognostic significance of p15 methylation was tested in ALL patients, showing no impact on complete remission, 5-year overall survival, or 5-year disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: Gene methylation of p15, but not p16, is frequent in adult acute leukemias. Methylation of p15 at diagnosis was of no prognostic significance in ALL but may be useful for monitoring MRD.","['Chim, C S', 'Tam, C Y', 'Liang, R', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Chim CS', 'Tam CY', 'Liang R', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. jcschim@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Genes, p16/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(20010615)91:12<2222::AID-CNCR1252>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jun 15;91(12):2222-9.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

Individual studies have compared the survival of patients with and without anemia and have shown reduced survival times in patients with various malignancies, including carcinoma of the lung, cervix, head and neck, prostate, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The objective of this study was to systematically review, to summarize, and to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of anemia on survival in patients with malignant disease. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was carried out using the MEDLINE data base and reviewing the reference lists from published studies. Two hundred papers were identified. Of these, 60 papers that reported the survival of cancer patients according to either hemoglobin levels or the presence of anemia were included. Among these papers, 25% related to patients with lung carcinoma, 17% related to patients with head and neck carcinoma, 12% related to patients with multiple myeloma, 10% related to patients with prostate carcinoma, 8% related to patients with cervicouterine carcinoma, 7% related to patients with leukemia, 5% related to patients with lymphoma, and 16% related to patients with other types of malignancies. RESULTS: The relative risk of death increased by 19% (95% confidence interval, 10-29%) in anemic patients with lung carcinoma, by 75% (37-123%) in anemic patients with head and neck carcinoma, by 47% (21-78%) in anemic patients with prostate carcinoma, and by 67% (30-113%) in anemic patients with lymphoma. The overall estimate increase in risk was 65% (54-77%).

Preclinical studies have suggested that a T-cell subset with a CD4-/CD8- double-negative (DN) T-cell phenotype is capable of suppressing GVHD. Double-negative T cells can be mobilized into the peripheral blood with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and enriched by density centrifugation. The current study was performed to study the feasibility and safety of applying a density gradient separation technique for enrichment of CD34+ and DN T cells, while depleting CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells from peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) for the purpose of allogeneic transplantation. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were treated with a myeloablative preparative regimen consisting of fractionated total body irradiation, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. Human leukocyte antigen identical donors were mobilized with G-CSF PBPC collected by apheresis. The apheresis product was applied to a single-step density gradient, and the low-density cell population was collected. The low-density cell population was infused as the sole source of allogeneic cells after myeloablative therapy. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine with or without prednisone. RESULTS: CD34 cell recovery was efficient with a median 72% yield, providing for a median CD34+ cell dose of 6.5 x 10(6)/kg (range,1.0- 13.9 x 10(6)/kg). CD3+CD4+ or CD3+CD8+ SP T cells were depleted by a median of 94.4% (range, 58.8- 99.2%), and the ratio of CD34+:SP T cells increased 10-fold. Double-negative T cells were depleted by 92% (range, 18.8- 99.4%), thus the ratio of DN:SP T cells increased less than 2-fold in 71% of apheresis samples tested. Hematopoietic engraftment was rapid, and there was no occurrence of graft failure in examinable patients. Median time to absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L was 10.5 and 12 days, respectively. The incidence of Grade 2-4 acute GVHD was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6-45%), although not all patients were examinable due to an unexpectedly high nonrecurrence mortality that at Day 180 was 62% (95% CI, 40-83%). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that T-cell subset manipulation via density gradient separation is a safe procedure and allowed rapid hematopoietic recovery. Selective enrichment of a donor DN T-cell subset was observed in only a few and was not associated with a reduced incidence of GVHD. However, the low-density selected cells still resulted in GVHD, and there was a high treatment-related mortality.","['Cao, T M', 'Kusnierz-Glaz, C', 'Valone, F', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, K E', 'Hu, W W', 'Johnston, L', 'Blume, K G', 'Strober, S', 'Negrin, R S']","['Cao TM', 'Kusnierz-Glaz C', 'Valone F', 'Stockerl-Goldstein KE', 'Hu WW', 'Johnston L', 'Blume KG', 'Strober S', 'Negrin RS']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California 94305-5623, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(20010615)91:12<2205::AID-CNCR1250>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jun 15;91(12):2205-13.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that the initial virus and provirus load could significantly influence the course of retrovirus infection. To determine the role of provirus loads, two methods of PCR, a nested PCR and a fluorogenic probe-based (TaqMan) real-time quantitative PCR, which were specific to the U3 region of FeLV-A were established. FeLV provirus in naturally and experimentally infected cats was then measured. Only 3 weeks after experimental FeLV-A infection, persistently infected cats demonstrated higher provirus loads and lower humoral immune responses than cats that had overcome antigenaemia. Lower initial provirus loads were associated with successful humoral immune responses. Unexpectedly, provirus in the buffy-coat cells of two cats that tested negative for the p27 antigen (a marker for viraemia) was also detected. In 597 Swiss cats, comparison of p27 antigen levels with PCR results revealed broad agreement. However, similar to the experimental situation, a significant number of animals (10%) was negative for the p27 antigen and FeLV-positive by PCR. These cats had a mean provirus load 300-fold lower than that of animals testing positive for the p27 antigen. In conclusion, an association between the provirus load and the outcome of FeLV infection was found. Detection of provirus carriers should contribute to further the control of FeLV. In addition, quantification of provirus loads will lead to a better understanding of FeLV pathogenesis and anti-retrovirus protective mechanisms.","['Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Huder, Jon B', 'Gruber, Sabine', 'Boretti, Felicitas', 'Sigrist, Brigitte', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Huder JB', 'Gruber S', 'Boretti F', 'Sigrist B', 'Lutz H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland1.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland1.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland1.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland1.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland1.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland1.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (p27 antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary', 'Viral Load', 'Viremia']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-82-7-1589 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2001 Jul;82(Pt 7):1589-1596. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-82-7-1589.,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-82-7-1589 [doi],,,,,,

The core of gp41 comprises an N-terminal triple-stranded coiled coil and an antiparallel C-terminal helical segment which is packed against the exterior of the coiled coil and is thought to correspond to a fusion-activated conformation. The available gp41 crystal structures lack the conserved disulfide-bonded loop region which, in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and murine leukemia virus TM proteins, mediates a chain reversal, connecting the antiparallel N- and C-terminal regions. Mutations in the HTLV-1 TM protein gp21 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region adversely affected fusion activity without abolishing SU-TM association (A. L. Maerz, R. J. Center, B. E. Kemp, B. Kobe, and P. Poumbourios, J. Virol. 74:6614-6621, 2000). We now report that in contrast to our findings with HTLV-1, conservative substitutions in the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region abolished association with gp120. While the mutations affecting gp120-gp41 association also affected cell-cell fusion activity, HIV-1 glycoprotein maturation appeared normal. The mutant glycoproteins were processed, expressed at the cell surface, and efficiently immunoprecipitated by conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies. The gp120 association site includes aromatic and hydrophobic residues on either side of the gp41 disulfide-bonded loop and a basic residue within the loop. The HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region is a critical gp120 contact site; therefore, it is also likely to play a central role in fusion activation by linking CD4 plus chemokine receptor-induced conformational changes in gp120 to gp41 fusogenicity. These gp120 contact residues are present in diverse primate lentiviruses, suggesting conservation of function.","['Maerz, A L', 'Drummer, H E', 'Wilson, K A', 'Poumbourios, P']","['Maerz AL', 'Drummer HE', 'Wilson KA', 'Poumbourios P']","[""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Disulfides', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*chemistry/metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.14.6635-6644.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jul;75(14):6635-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.14.6635-6644.2001.,PMC114387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vectors containing wild-type reverse transcriptase (RT), vectors encoding the D110E mutation to inactivate polymerase, and vectors encoding mutations D443A and E478Q to inactivate RNase H were constructed. 293 cells were cotransfected with different proportions of plasmids encoding these vectors to generate phenotypically mixed virions. The resulting viruses were used to infect human osteosarcoma cells, and the relative infectivity of the viruses was determined by measuring transduction of the murine cell surface marker CD24, which is encoded by the vectors. The results indicated that there is an excess of both polymerase and RNase H activities in virions. Viral replication was reduced to 42% of wild-type levels in virions with where half of the RT molecules were predicted to be catalytically active but dropped to 3% of wild-type levels when 25% of the RT molecules were active. However, reducing RNase H activity had a lesser effect on viral replication. As expected, based on previous work with murine leukemia virus, there was relatively inefficient virus replication when the RNase H and polymerase activities were encoded on separate vectors (D110E plus E478Q and D110E plus D443A). To determine how virus replication failed when polymerase and RNase H activities were reduced, reverse transcription intermediates were measured in vector-infected cells by using quantitative real-time PCR. The results indicated that using the D11OE mutation to reduce the amount of active polymerase reduced the number of reverse transcripts that were initiated and also reduced the amounts of products from the late stages of reverse transcription. If the E478Q mutation was used to reduce RNase H activity, the number of reverse transcripts that were initiated was reduced; there was also a strong effect on minus-strand transfer.","['Julias, J G', 'Ferris, A L', 'Boyer, P L', 'Hughes, S H']","['Julias JG', 'Ferris AL', 'Boyer PL', 'Hughes SH']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, NCI-Frederick, Building 539, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/enzymology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.14.6537-6546.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jul;75(14):6537-46. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.14.6537-6546.2001.,PMC114377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparison of MoMLV-based vector transduction in mammalian and nonmammalian cells shows that the nonmammalian cells exhibit blocks at either entry, reverse transcription, or integration. Additionally, VSV-G-pseudotyped MoMLV-based vector transduction is attenuated in the zebrafish cell line ZF4 at entry and/or reverse transcription, whereas other transduction processes are unaffected. We show that the variation of transduction by MoMLV-based vectors in mammalian and nonmammalian cells is not due to differences in culture conditions or cell division rate but is likely the result of divergence in cellular factors required for retroviral transduction.","['Dirks, C', 'Miller, A D']","['Dirks C', 'Miller AD']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anura', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Diptera', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Moths', 'Retroviridae', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transformation, Genetic', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/chemistry/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Integration', 'Zebrafish']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.14.6375-6383.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jul;75(14):6375-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.14.6375-6383.2001.,PMC114360,,,"['P50 HL054881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Position 184 is the X of the conserved YXDD motif; positions 185 and 186 form part of the triad of aspartic acids at the polymerase active site. Structural and biochemical analysis of 3TC-resistant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) led to a model in which a beta-branched amino acid at position 184 would act as a steric gate. Normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) could still be incorporated; the oxathiolane ring of 3TCTP would clash with the beta branch of the amino acid at position 184. This model can also explain 3TC resistance in feline immunodeficiency virus and human hepatitis B virus. However, it has been reported (14) that murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) with valine (the amino acid present in the wild type), isoleucine, alanine, serine, or methionine at the X position of the YXDD motif are all resistant to 3TC. We prepared purified wild-type MLV RT and mutant MLV RTs with methionine, isoleucine, and alanine at the X position. The behavior of these RTs was compared to those of wild-type HIV-1 RT and of HIV-1 RT with alanine at the X position. If alanine is present at the X position, both MLV RT and HIV-1 RT are relatively resistant to 3TCTP in vitro.

In acute promyelocytic leukemia, PML/retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha expression disrupts NBs, but therapies such as retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide (As2O3) restore them. PML is conjugated by the ubiquitin-related peptide SUMO-1, a process enhanced by As2O3 and proposed to target PML to the nuclear matrix. We demonstrate that As2O3 triggers the proteasome-dependent degradation of PML and PML/RARalpha and that this process requires a specific sumolation site in PML, K160. PML sumolation is dispensable for its As2O3-induced matrix targeting and formation of primary nuclear aggregates, but is required for the formation of secondary shell-like NBs. Interestingly, only these mature NBs harbor 11S proteasome components, which are further recruited upon As2O3 exposure. Proteasome recruitment by sumolated PML only likely accounts for the failure of PML-K160R to be degraded. Therefore, studying the basis of As2O3-induced PML/RARalpha degradation we show that PML sumolation directly or indirectly promotes its catabolism, suggesting that mature NBs could be sites of intranuclear proteolysis and opening new insights into NB alterations found in viral infections or transformation.","['Lallemand-Breitenbach, V', 'Zhu, J', 'Puvion, F', 'Koken, M', 'Honore, N', 'Doubeikovsky, A', 'Duprez, E', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Puvion, E', 'Freemont, P', 'de The, H']","['Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Zhu J', 'Puvion F', 'Koken M', 'Honore N', 'Doubeikovsky A', 'Duprez E', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Puvion E', 'Freemont P', 'de The H']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UPR 9051, Laboratoire Associe N degrees 11 du Comite de Paris de la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Universite Paris VII, Hopital St. Louis 1, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', '*Endopeptidases', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.193.12.1361 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2001 Jun 18;193(12):1361-71. doi: 10.1084/jem.193.12.1361.,PMC2193303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SETTING: The Nord Cotentin region (France) and the island of Alderney (United Kingdom). STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the occurrence of leukaemia for each age group and cytological type from 1978 to 1998 in the same area, using accurate reference incidence rates and adequate estimation of the at risk population. DESIGN: A geographical study of incidence using three zones defined according to their distance from the site (0 to 10 km: Beaumont-Hague electoral ward, 10 to 20 km and 20 to 35 km) has been conducted. The risk of leukaemia was estimated from the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of the number of cases observed to the number expected. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CI) have been computed. PARTICIPANTS: All people under the age of 25 years living in the study region between 1978 and 1998. MAIN RESULTS: The observed number of cases of leukaemia in the study region as a whole was consistent with the expected value (SIR=1.03; 95%CI: 0.73, 1.41). No cases were observed on Alderney. The SIR in the Beaumont-Hague electoral ward was 2.17 (95%CI: 0.71, 5.07). The highest SIR was observed in the 5 to 9 years age group (SIR=6.38; 95%CI: 1.32, 18.65). This consists in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. CONCLUSION: This study indicates an increased incidence of leukaemia in the area situated at less than 10 km from the plant. Monitoring and further investigations should be targeted at acute lymphoblastic leukaemia occurring during the childhood incidence peak (before 10 years) in children living near the La Hague site and may be other nuclear reprocessing plants.","['Guizard, A V', 'Boutou, O', 'Pottier, D', 'Troussard, X', 'Pheby, D', 'Launoy, G', 'Slama, R', 'Spira, A']","['Guizard AV', 'Boutou O', 'Pottier D', 'Troussard X', 'Pheby D', 'Launoy G', 'Slama R', 'Spira A']","['Registre des cancers de La Manche (ARKM), hopital Louis Pasteur, Cherbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,['0 (Radioactive Waste)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Channel Islands/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radioactive Waste/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.55.7.469 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 2001 Jul;55(7):469-74. doi: 10.1136/jech.55.7.469.,PMC1731936,,['ARKM.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the loss of gastrointestinal tract integrity, and specifically the translocation of LPS into the systemic circulation, is critical to the induction of cytokine dysregulation that contributes to GVHD. Using a mouse BMT model, we studied the effects of direct LPS antagonism on GVHD severity and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. Administration of B975, a synthetic lipid-A analogue from day 0 to day +6, reduced serum TNF-alpha levels, decreased intestinal histopathology, and resulted in significantly improved survival and a reduction in clinical GVHD, compared with control-treated animals. Importantly, B975 had no effect on donor T cell responses to host antigens in vivo or in vitro. When mice received lethal doses of P815 tumor cells at the time of BMT, administration of B975 did not impair GVL activity and resulted in significantly improved leukemia-free survival. These findings reveal a critical role for LPS in the early inflammatory events contributing to GVHD and suggest that a new class of pharmacologic agents, LPS antagonists, may help to prevent GVHD while preserving T cell responses to host antigens and GVL activity.","['Cooke, K R', 'Gerbitz, A', 'Crawford, J M', 'Teshima, T', 'Hill, G R', 'Tesolin, A', 'Rossignol, D P', 'Ferrara, J L']","['Cooke KR', 'Gerbitz A', 'Crawford JM', 'Teshima T', 'Hill GR', 'Tesolin A', 'Rossignol DP', 'Ferrara JL']","['Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0942, USA. krcooke@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (B 975)', '0 (Lipid A)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Intestines/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/prevention & control', 'Lipid A/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI12156 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2001 Jun;107(12):1581-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI12156.,PMC200193,,,"['HL-03565/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-55162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['J Clin Invest. 2001 Jun;107(12):1497-8.

Study of 30 episodes].,738-40,"BACKGROUND: To analyse the etiology, diagnostic methods and response to therapy in 30 episodes of pneumonia diagnosed in 17 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) between 1995 and 2000. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In each episode of pneumonia the following data were analysed: age, gender, treatment of CLL, antiinfectious prophylaxis, granulocytopenia, CD4/CD8 lymphocytes ratio, hipogammaglobulinemia, origin of pneumonia (nosocomial or community-acquired), localisation, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial therapy and response. Diagnostic methods included blood and sputum cultures, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and search for antigens in urine (Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, galactomannan, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). RESULTS: Median age of the series was 60 yr. (range 50-86) and 12 patients were male. Chlorambucil and prednisone were used in 13 cases and fludarabine in 8. Granulocytopenia was present in 14 episodes, hypogammaglobulinemia was seen in 22 and CD4/CD8 ratio was lower than 1 in 8 out of 14 evaluable cases. Etiology of pneumonia was established in 16 episodes (53%). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was the most useful technique (83% of positive diagnoses) followed by blood cultures (38%). Two patients were diagnosed of aspergillosis at autopsy. Pneumococcus was the most frequent agent (5 cases) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Pneumocystis carinii (2) and Aspergillus fumigatus (2). One out of the two patients with P. carinii pneumonia had received fludarabin and the remaining was treated with prednisone for long time. Ten patients (30%) had died: P. aeruginosa (3 cases), P. carinii (2), A. fumigatus (2), Mycobacterium xenopi (1), and unknown microorganism (2). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of CLL patients the frequency of etiologic diagnosis of pneumonias was good. Pneumococcus was the most frequent microorganism. Pneumonias caused by opportunistic microorganisms were associated to the treatment with fludarabin or prednisone and were associated to a high mortality rate.","['Batlle, M', 'Ribera, J M', 'Oriol, A', 'Rodriguez, L', 'Cirauqui, B', 'Xicoy, B', 'Grau, J', 'Feliu, J', 'Flores, A', 'Milla, F']","['Batlle M', 'Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Rodriguez L', 'Cirauqui B', 'Xicoy B', 'Grau J', 'Feliu J', 'Flores A', 'Milla F']","['Servicio de Hematologia-Hemoterapia, Unitat Hematooncologica, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/diagnosis/*etiology']",2001/06/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-7753(01)71970-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-7753(01)71970-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2001 May 26;116(19):738-40. doi: 10.1016/s0025-7753(01)71970-7.,,,,,,Neumonias en pacientes con leucemia linfatica cronica.

Most patients with ALL show karyotype abnormalities, either in chromosome number (ploidy) or as structural changes such as translocations, inversions, or deletions. Many of these chromosomal alterations are associated with specific cytomorphological and immunological types. The greatest impact on patient management has been the finding that the cytogenetic result is an independent prognostic indicator. Certain karyotypes are associated with a favorable prognosis while others indicate a poor outcome. This has led to the administration of alternative therapies according to risk. For instance, hyperdiploidy with a modal chromosome number of 51 or greater, which represents 25-30 % of all cases of ALL, has proved to have the most favorable prognosis among established ploidy groups, whilst translocations such as the Philadelphia translocation t(9;22) and t(4;11) are associated with a poor prognosis.

T cells in ZAP-70-deficient patients are assumed to have no helper functions for B-cell immunoglobulin synthesis, whereas the patients rarely have antigen-specific antibodies. We experienced a ZAP-70-deficient patient, who had immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to food allergens, and we investigated the mechanisms of switching to IgE in the patient. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patient did not proliferate upon stimulation with the antigens but produced distinct levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4). Cell sorting analysis indicated that the cells that produced IL-4 in response to the antigens were enriched in CD4+ T cells. Purified CD4+ T cells from the patient produced IL-4 and expressed CD40L upon stimulation with anti-CD3. Moreover, CD4+ T cells pretreated with anti-CD3 induced mature epsilon transcript on naive B cells. Since the results indicated that there remained sufficient T-cell receptor (TCR)-signalling in the patient's T cells to exert antigen-specific IgE switching on B cells, we next investigated the expression of the ZAP-70-homologous kinase Syk. Syk was present in high levels in patient's CD4+ T cells and was tyrosine-phosphorylated after TCR stimulation. Inhibition of Syk by piceatannol resulted in decreased production of IL-4 and expression of CD40L on patient's CD4+ T cells. Moreover, Syk was expressed on all human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1)-transformed T-cell lines derived from peripheral blood of the patient, whereas it was low or undetectable in control lines. It was therefore concluded that specific IgE responses in the patient were most likely to be mediated by Syk-dependent TCR-signalling.","['Toyabe, S', 'Watanabe, A', 'Harada, W', 'Karasawa, T', 'Uchiyama, M']","['Toyabe S', 'Watanabe A', 'Harada W', 'Karasawa T', 'Uchiyama M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Niigata University School of Medicine, Asahimachi, Niigata, Japan. toyabe@med.niigata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/*immunology', 'Female', 'Food', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*biosynthesis', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*deficiency/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2001/06/20 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/20 10:00'],"['2001/06/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['imm1246 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.2001.01246.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2001 Jun;103(2):164-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.2001.01246.x.,PMC1783225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial noradrenergic properties are downregulated and the innervation acquires cholinergic and peptidergic properties. To elucidate the cellular mechanisms responsible, sympathetic neurons were cultured with primary periosteal cells or osteoblast cell lines. Both primary cells and an immature osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1, induced choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. In contrast, lines representing marrow stromal cells or mature osteoblasts did not increase ChAT. Growth of periosteal cells with sympathetic neurons in transwell cultures that prevent direct contact between the neurons and periosteal cells or addition of periosteal cell-conditioned medium to neuron cultures induced ChAT, indicating that periosteal cells release a soluble cholinergic inducing factor. Antibodies against LIFRbeta, a receptor subunit shared by neuropoietic cytokines, prevented ChAT induction in periosteal cell/neuron cocultures, suggesting that a member of this family is responsible. ChAT activity was increased in neurons grown with periosteal cells or conditioned medium from mice lacking either leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or LIF and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).

A nontoxic concentration of haloperidol (1-30 microM) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of vinblastine (VBL) concentration-dependently in VBL-resistant human leukemia (K562/VBL) cells, but had no effect in the parent cells. Haloperidol also enhanced the cytotoxicities of epirubicin, doxorubicin and actinomycin D in the K562/VBL cells, but not those of idarubicin or cisplatin; this enhancement was less than that of the VBL toxicity in the VBL-resistant tumor line. Haloperidol increased the intracellular accumulation of VBL in the K562/VBL cells, and the binding of [3H]-azidopine to the cell-surface protein, P-glycoprotein, was inhibited by haloperidol in a concentration-dependent manner. Haloperidol was less potent than verapamil. Thus, haloperidol appeared to potentiate anticancer agents through the reversal of MDR by competitively inhibiting drug-binding to P-glycoprotein. In contrast, the main metabolite of haloperidol, dihydrohaloperidol, without antipsychotic activity, had less of an effect.

We have studied the vastus lateralis muscle in 12 patients with chronic disuse atrophy associated with chronic osteoarthritis of the hip both preoperatively and after total hip arthroplasty. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated an increase in the level of expression of myostatin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mRNAs compared to healthy control muscle. In all patients there was a significant correlation preoperatively between increasing myostatin mRNA expression and reduction in type 2A and 2B fiber area. In the 8 female patients there was a significant correlation between increased myostatin mRNA expression and the atrophy factor calculated for 2A and 2B fiber types preoperatively. We hypothesize that a complex interaction occurs between muscle growth regulating factors in the genesis of muscle wasting. Our results indicate that myostatin is a muscle-wasting factor contributing to type 2B and 2A atrophy. Other muscle growth factors, such as IGF-1 and LIF, may be upregulated in a counterregulatory fashion or may be involved in the fiber type switching seen in disuse muscle wasting.","['Reardon, K A', 'Davis, J', 'Kapsa, R M', 'Choong, P', 'Byrne, E']","['Reardon KA', 'Davis J', 'Kapsa RM', 'Choong P', 'Byrne E']","[""Melbourne Neuromuscular Institute, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fifth Floor, Daly Wing, 41 Victoria Parade, Fitzroy 3065, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Muscle Nerve,Muscle & nerve,7803146,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (MSTN protein, human)', '0 (Myostatin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immobilization/adverse effects', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle, Skeletal/pathology/physiopathology', 'Muscular Atrophy/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Myostatin', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/mus.1086 [pii]', '10.1002/mus.1086 [doi]']",ppublish,Muscle Nerve. 2001 Jul;24(7):893-9. doi: 10.1002/mus.1086.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Now, haplotyping can identify heterozygotes for AT mutation (ATM) in AT families, allowing the risk of cancer associated with ATM heterozygosity status to be better assessed. We report a family study of AT patients, in which we estimated the risk of cancer according to ATM heterozygosity status. We analyzed demographic characteristics and occurrence of cancer in 1,423 relatives of AT patients. Haplotyping was performed in living relatives. The probability of being heterozygotes for ATM was calculated for deceased relatives. The risk of developing cancer was estimated in the cohort of relatives, and expected numbers of cancer cases were calculated from French age period-specific incidence rates. The number of cancers at all sites in the total population of relatives was not higher than expected. However, significant heterogeneity was found according to ATM heterozygosity status. This is mainly due to the increased risk of breast cancer previously observed in obligate heterozygotes. In obligate heterozygotes, relative risk (RR) was non-significantly increased for thyroid cancer, leukemia and liver cancer. Risks of ovarian, lung, pancreatic, kidney, stomach and colorectal cancers were non-significantly increased in the group with 0.5 probability of being heterozygotes. The RR was not significantly increased for any site of cancer, except for breast. Therefore, there is no evidence that specific screening of relatives of AT patients would be justified at particular sites other than the breast. However, the amplitude of the risk of breast cancer estimated in heterozygous women does not appear to justify a separate screening program from that already available to women with a first-degree relative affected by breast cancer.","['Geoffroy-Perez, B', 'Janin, N', 'Ossian, K', 'Lauge, A', 'Croquette, M F', 'Griscelli, C', 'Debre, M', 'Bressac-de-Paillerets, B', 'Aurias, A', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet, D', 'Andrieu, N']","['Geoffroy-Perez B', 'Janin N', 'Ossian K', 'Lauge A', 'Croquette MF', 'Griscelli C', 'Debre M', 'Bressac-de-Paillerets B', 'Aurias A', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet D', 'Andrieu N']","['U521 INSERM, Institut Gustave Roussy, 39 rue Camille Desmoulins, 94805 Villejuif Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*complications/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1329 [doi]', '10.1002/ijc.1329 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jul 15;93(2):288-93. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1329.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

A Phase I trial was conducted using PSC 833, a Pgp antagonist, in combination with paclitaxel in patients with refractory cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of PSC 833 on the metabolism of paclitaxel and characterize the differences in 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel pharmacokinetics. In addition, we examined the possibility of enhanced cytotoxicity of paclitaxel by the coexistence of 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received paclitaxel 35 mg/m(2)/day by continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) x 4 days without PSC 833 in cycle 1 and escalating doses of paclitaxel (13.1, 17.5, or 21.3 mg/m(2)/day CIVI x 4 days) with 5 mg/kg PSC 833 by mouth every 6 h x 7 days in cycle 2. Plasma samples were analyzed for both paclitaxel and its major metabolite with high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Using human liver microsomes, we studied the effect of PSC 833 on the metabolism of paclitaxel. In addition, the in vitro cytotoxicity of 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel alone and in combination with paclitaxel was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 22 patients had a metabolite peak (6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel) observed in the chromatogram of plasma samples from cycle 2 when they received paclitaxel in combination with PSC 833. This metabolite was not detectable in plasma obtained during the first cycle when they received paclitaxel without PSC 833. During cycle 2, the mean concentrations of 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel and paclitaxel were 0.10 +/- 0.074 and 0.079 +/- 0.041 microg/ml, respectively. A moderate association was observed between total bilirubin and 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel concentrations (P = 0.015, r = 0.52; n = 21). Human liver microsome experiments showed that a PSC 833 concentration as high as 10 microM did not affect the production of 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel. Paclitaxel cytotoxicity in HL60 and K562 human leukemia cells was increased in the presence of noncytotoxic concentrations of 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: PSC 833 increases the plasma concentration of 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel during paclitaxel therapy. Inhibition of cytochrome P-450 3A4 by PSC 833 may explain this in part, although other mechanisms cannot be excluded.","['Kang, M H', 'Figg, W D', 'Ando, Y', 'Blagosklonny, M V', 'Liewehr, D', 'Fojo, T', 'Bates, S E']","['Kang MH', 'Figg WD', 'Ando Y', 'Blagosklonny MV', 'Liewehr D', 'Fojo T', 'Bates SE']","['Medicine Branch, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '153212-75-0 (6-hydroxytaxol)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Bilirubin/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'Paclitaxel/analogs & derivatives/*blood/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', '*Taxoids', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Jun;7(6):1610-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we review the preclinical and clinical profiles of this immunoconjugate and the regulatory review that led to marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: From the literature and manufacturer's data, we review the activity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in preclinical and Phase I studies and its activity, efficacy, and side effects in three Phase 2 trials of 142 patients with relapsed AML. RESULTS: In Phase I studies, the major toxicity was myelosuppression, especially neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, resulting from the expression of CD33 on myeloid progenitor cells. The Phase 2 dose was 9 mg/m(2) infused i.v. over 4 h, repeated on day 14. A minority of patients experienced acute infusion-related symptoms, usually transient and occasionally requiring hospitalization. The complete response (CR) rate with full recovery of hematopoiesis was 16%. A subset of patients [CRs with incomplete platelet recovery (CRps)] was identified with blast clearance and neutrophil recovery but incomplete platelet recovery. The duration of responses of CRps appeared to be similar to those of the CRs, although the numbers were small. The question of the equivalence of these response groups was a central issue in the review of this new drug application (NDA). After considerable discussion, the Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee recommended allowing inclusion of CRps resulting in an overall response rate in the Phase 2 studies of 30%. In the subgroup of patients over 60 years of age, the overall response rate was 26%. Response duration was difficult to establish because of the high prevalence of postremission therapies. Tolerability and ease of administration may be improved compared with conventional chemotherapy, except for hepatotoxicity, with 31% of patients exhibiting abnormal liver enzymes. One patient died of liver failure in the Phase 2 trials. CONCLUSIONS: Marketing approval of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was granted on May 17, 2000 by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Accelerated Approval regulations. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD33 positive AML in first relapse who are 60 years of age or older and who are not considered candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy. The approved dose was 9 mg/m(2) i.v. over 4 h and repeated in 14 days. Completion of the ongoing studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed AML and initiation of randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with conventional induction chemotherapy to conventional chemotherapy alone on survival are mandated to confirm clinical benefit under the accelerated approval Subpart H regulations. Postmarketing reports of fatal anaphylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hepatotoxicity, especially venoocclusive disease (VOD) in patients treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, with and without associated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), have required labeling revisions and the initiation of a registration surveillance program. Tumor lysis and ARDS have been reported in patients with leukocytes above 30,000/ml treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin; therefore, the reduction of leukocyte counts to below 30,000/ml is recommended prior to treatment. Patients should be carefully monitored for acute hypersensitivity, hypoxia, and delayed hepatotoxicity following treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.","['Bross, P F', 'Beitz, J', 'Chen, G', 'Chen, X H', 'Duffy, E', 'Kieffer, L', 'Roy, S', 'Sridhara, R', 'Rahman, A', 'Williams, G', 'Pazdur, R']","['Bross PF', 'Beitz J', 'Chen G', 'Chen XH', 'Duffy E', 'Kieffer L', 'Roy S', 'Sridhara R', 'Rahman A', 'Williams G', 'Pazdur R']","['Division of Oncology Drug Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA. brossp@cder.fda.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Chemical', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Jun;7(6):1490-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res 2002 Jan;8(1):300'],,

Preliminary clinical studies with bendamustine, an alkylating agent with a purine nucleus, provide strong evidence that this drug is a highly effective cytostatic in low grade lymphomas. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro activity of bendamustine in combination with other established cytotoxic drugs. DESIGN AND METHODS: 2 lines (DOHH-2, WSU-NHL) and mononuclear cells (MNC) from patients with leukemic low-grade B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (n=10), T-NHL (n=7) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=12). Apoptosis (7-AAD), depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, JC-1), caspase-3-activity (FIENA) and cell proliferation (XTT/WST-1) were determined. Several incubation times and drug dosages (for IC(30/50/75/90)) were studied. Synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects were calculated by a median plot effect and the combination index (CI) method. RESULTS: In general, combinations of bendamustine with mitoxantrone or doxorubicin resulted in antagonistic effects in the tested cell lines and the MNC from the patients. CI-calculation failed in these cases since there was not a sufficient dose response. On the other hand, the combination of bendamustine with 2-CdA showed synergistic in vitro activity on the tested cell lines, neoplastic lymphocytes from patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas and partially on MNC from patients with CLL and B-NHL. The antagonism of the combination of bendamustine and anthracyclines appeared to be due to inhibition of depolarization of mitochondrial-membrane potential and caspase-3-activity during apoptosis of the studied cell lines. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results suggest that schedules using combinations of bendamustine and anthracyclines should not be recommended for the treatment of low-grade NHL, whereas bendamustine combined with 2-CdA could be considered for the development of future treatment strategies.","['Chow, K U', 'Boehrer, S', 'Geduldig, K', 'Krapohl, A', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Weidmann, E']","['Chow KU', 'Boehrer S', 'Geduldig K', 'Krapohl A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Weidmann E']","['University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/06/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 May;86(5):485-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term results of the AIEOP-ALL 87 study.,478-84,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In March 1987 AIEOP started the AIEOP-ALL-87 study, based on the previous AIEOP-ALL-82. The aim of this new study was to evaluate, for all risk groups: a) the efficacy of treatment intensification achieved by adding a fourth drug (daunomycin) in the induction phase and a 3-drug reinduction phase for all risk groups; b) the impact of the addition of three doses of intrathecal methotrexate during cranial radiotherapy and extended exposure to weekly high-dose L-aspariginase during late intensification in high risk patients. We report the long-term results of the AIEOP ALL-87 study. DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1987 to 1991, a total of 632 eligible and evaluable children (age 1 to < or =16 years) with non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), were enrolled and stratified as follows: standard risk (SR, 79 patients, 12.5%) had WBC <10,000/mm3, age > or = 3 and <7 years, and FAB L1 morphology. The high risk (HR, 175 patients, 27.7%) group included patients with WBC > or =50,000/mm3 or FAB L3 morphology or T immunophenotype or acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) or leukemia-lymphoma syndrome. All the remaining patients formed the intermediate risk group (IR, 378 patients, 59.8%). All patients received a 4-drug induction therapy; intermediate-dose methotrexate was given to HR patients; cranial radiotherapy was given to IR and HR patients, while SR patients received extended intrathecal methotrexate; all patients received a 3-drug reinduction phase; high dose L-asparaginase (HD-L-ASP; E.Coli, Bayer) was given to HR patients; continuation therapy with 6-mercaptopurine, i.m. methotrexate, and monthly vincristine and prednisone pulses was given to all patients. Treatment duration was 2 years. RESULTS: Six hundred and nineteen patients (97.9%) achieved complete remission. The remission rate was 98.7% in the SR group, 98.1% in the IR group, and 97.1% in the HR group. The overall 10-year survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates (SE) are 74.7% (1.8) and 62.8% (2.0) respectively; EFS rates by risk group are 67.5% (5.5) in SR, 62.8% (2.6) in IR, and 61.9% (3.8) for HR. The 10-year EFS for all eligible patients was 63.9% (1.9). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: When compared to the results of the AIEOP-ALL-82 study, treatment intensification in the ALL-87 study has improved long-term survival and EFS from 66.4% and 53.6% to 74.7% and 62.8%, respectively. Failures were mostly due to marrow or extramedullary relapses suggesting that further treatment intensification, as being used in current therapeutic strategies, is appropriate, although patients relapsing after less intensive treatment may have better chances of rescue. These results, although obtained in a relatively large proportion of patients, in which infants were not included, indicate that the addition of high-dose L-asparaginase to a relatively non-intensive treatment may be of major benefit for HR patients and that the addition of intrathecal methotrexate during CRT, may improve the central nervous system-disease control with a marked reduction of nervous system relapses.","['Paolucci, G', 'Vecchi, V', 'Favre, C', 'Miniero, R', 'Madon, E', 'Pession, A', 'Rondelli, R', 'De Rossi, G', 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Porta, F', 'Santoro, N', 'Indolfi, P', 'Basso, G', 'Conter, V', 'Arico, M']","['Paolucci G', 'Vecchi V', 'Favre C', 'Miniero R', 'Madon E', 'Pession A', 'Rondelli R', 'De Rossi G', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Porta F', 'Santoro N', 'Indolfi P', 'Basso G', 'Conter V', 'Arico M']","[""Clinica Pediatrica dell'Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/06/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 May;86(5):478-84.,,,['Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far expression studies of apoptosis-regulating genes on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have mainly focused on Bcl-2 itself and most of them have not included other factors involved in drug resistance or apoptosis as parameters determining response to chemotherapy, disease progression and survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: We therefore examined Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bax gene expression in 235 adult patients with de novo or secondary myeloid leukemia. The expression levels were correlated with established prognostic factors such as age, cytogentic aberrations, mdr1 gene expression and clinical outcome in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL positive patients had a much lower white blood cell count than negative patients (p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively). Bcl-2 expression correlated with FAB subtype M0 (p=0.03), Bax with M5b (p=0.02) and Bcl-XL with M6 (p=0.005). Mdr1 expression was more frequently seen in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL positive patients (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively). Remarkably Bax was significantly less frequently expressed in de novo AML patients with high risk cytogenetics (p=0.007). No difference in expression was recognized for Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL when statistical analyses were done for cytogenetic risk groups. However, in the multivariate analysis regarding the group of de novo AML patients < or =60 years with intermediate risk cytogenetics, Bcl-XL expression was found to be an independent negative prognostic factor for response to induction therapy (p=0.04).

Neither Bcl-2 nor Bax nor Bcl-XL expression had a significant influence on overall or disease-free survival.

These entities may be either asymptomatic or associated with autoimmune manifestations (especially cytopenias). A number of surface receptors, expressed by NK-cells and some T-lymphocyte subsets repress cytotoxicity and cytokine production upon ligation with HLA class I molecules and are clonally expressed in theses lymphoproliferative disorders. These cytotoxic lymphocytes can lyse erythroid progenitors in vitro, and the physiologic lower levels of HLA class I antigens on the erythroid lineage may contribute to this form of autoimmunity. It is conceivable that the clinical outcome of T-LGLD might be influenced by the expression of MHC class I inhibitory receptors. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the surface expression of these molecules, lectin-like heterodimers (CD94/NKG2A) or killer immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (KIR) and another Ig-like inhibitory receptor, termed ILT2 or LIR-1 in CD8+ cells from 12 cases of ab T-LGLD using specific monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: None of the LGLD cases had anemia and 11 of 12 patients remain asymptomatic. KIR and CD94/NKG2A expression was detected on CD8+ populations only in some cases of T-LGLD. By contrast, our observations revealed that ILT2 expression was markedly higher in CD8+ cells from LGLD patients than from healthy donors. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the ILT2 inhibitory receptor for HLA class I molecules on LGLD cells might indeed contribute to preventing their autoreactivity. Further studies are required to evaluate the expression/function of the ILT2 receptor in patients who eventually become symptomatic. The development of cytopenias in LGLD patients must involve other self-reactive activating receptors. Analysis of the expression and function of triggering NKR in LGLD needs to be carefully addressed.","['Casado, L F', 'Granados, E', 'Algara, P', 'Navarro, F', 'Martinez-Frejo, M C', 'Lopez-Botet, M']","['Casado LF', 'Granados E', 'Algara P', 'Navarro F', 'Martinez-Frejo MC', 'Lopez-Botet M']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Avenida de Barber 30, Toledo, Spain. lcasado@cht.insalud.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (LILRB1 protein, human)', '0 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B1)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B1', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",2001/06/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 May;86(5):457-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KBrO3 induced 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formation in human leukemia cell line HL-60 as well as in its H2O2-resistant clone, HP100, suggesting no involvement of H2O2. Depletion of GSH by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) had a little inhibitory effect on KBrO3-induced 8-oxodG formation. However, the amount of 8-oxodG was still significantly higher than that in control, suggesting that intracellular Cys can affect KBrO3 to oxidize DNA, when GSH decreased. KBrO3 caused 8-oxodG in isolated DNA in the presence of GSH (tripeptide; gamma-GluCysGly), gamma-GluCys, CysGly, or Cys. Methional completely inhibited 8-oxodG formation induced by KBrO3 plus GSH, but typical hydroxyl radical scavengers, SOD and catalase, had little or no inhibitory effects. When bromine solution (BrO(-)) was used instead of BrO3(-), similar scavenger effects were observed. Experiments with 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human p53 tumor suppressor gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene suggested that KBrO3 induced 8-oxodG formation at 5'-site guanine of GG and GGG sequences of double-stranded DNA in the presence of GSH and that treatment of formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase led to chain cleavages at the guanine residues. ESR spin-trapping studies showed that 1:2:2:1 quartet DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) spectrum similar to DMPO/hydroxy radical (*OH) adduct, but the signals were not inhibited by ethanol. Therefore, the signal seemed not to be due to *OH but byproduct due to oxidation of DMPO by the reactive species. The signals were suppressed by the addition of dGMP, but not by other mononucleotides, suggesting the specific reactivity with guanine. On the basis of our results and previous literature, it is speculated that reduction of KBrO3 by SH compounds in renal proximal tubular cells yields bromine oxides and bromine radicals, which are the reactive species that cause guanine oxidation, leading to renal carcinogenesis of KBrO3.","['Murata, M', 'Bansho, Y', 'Inoue, S', 'Ito, K', 'Ohnishi, S', 'Midorikawa, K', 'Kawanishi, S']","['Murata M', 'Bansho Y', 'Inoue S', 'Ito K', 'Ohnishi S', 'Midorikawa K', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Hygiene, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bromates)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Food Additives)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '04MB35W6ZA (potassium bromate)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'AR09D82C7G (Deuterium)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry', 'Bromates/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cysteine/*chemistry', '*DNA Damage', 'Deuterium/chemistry', 'Food Additives/*adverse effects', 'Free Radicals/adverse effects', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Glutathione/*chemistry', 'Guanine/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Spin Trapping']",2001/06/21 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/06/21 10:00'],"['2001/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['tx000209q [pii]', '10.1021/tx000209q [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2001 Jun;14(6):678-85. doi: 10.1021/tx000209q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR-ABL oncoprotein is a constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), which results in altered cell signalling and is responsible for the changes that characterize the malignant cells of CML. It has been shown that the increased tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is a requirement for transformation and is, therefore, a legitimate target for pharmacological inhibition. Several compounds have now been identified as relatively selective inhibitors of BCR-ABL, including members of the tyrphostin family, herbimycin A and most importantly the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine ST1571. Having established the efficacy of this agent in vitro, phase I trials using an oral formulation were commenced in the USA in mid 1998. Early data from an interferon-alpha (IFN) resistant/refractory or intolerant cohort demonstrated good patient tolerance and effective haematological control at doses above 300 mg. More promising was its ability to induce cytogenetic responses in this pretreated group of patients. Phase II data, albeit far from complete, appear to confirm its efficacy even in the context of advanced disease and phase III clinical trials are currently underway in many countries. Recent laboratory evidence, however, suggests that the development of drug resistance is a possibility (via amplification of the bcr-abl fusion gene, overexpression of P-glycoprotein or binding of ST1571 to alpha1 acid glycoprotein) and that combination therapy including ST1571 should be considered.","['Drummond, M W', 'Holyoake, T L']","['Drummond MW', 'Holyoake TL']","['Academic Transfusion Medicine Unit, University Department of Medicine, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK. mwd3z@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2001/06/21 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/06/21 10:00'],"['2001/06/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/blre.2001.0152 [doi]', 'S0268-960X(01)90152-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2001 Jun;15(2):85-95. doi: 10.1054/blre.2001.0152.,,,,,126,,['Copyright 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,

All experiments were performed in parallel using the Epo-responsive UT7 cell line. From semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments, VSMCs were estimated to express approximately 30-fold less EpoR mRNA than UT7 cells. Epo-induced phosphorylation of proteins involved in the EpoR/JAK2/STAT5 cascade could not be detected in VSMCs, even using pharmacological doses of Epo (250 IU/ml). In contrast, a strong activation of MAP kinase pathway was detected with as low as 10 IU/ml Epo.

Utilizing rotating wall vessels (RWVs) to generate simulated microgravity conditions, we found that respiratory burst activity was significantly altered in nonadherent promyelocytic (HL-60) cells. Specifically, HL-60 cells in simulated microgravity for 6, 19, 42, 47, and 49 d had 3.8-fold fewer cells that were able to participate in respiratory burst activity than cells from 1 x g cultures (P = 0.0011, N = 5).

Furthermore, the kinetic response for phorbol ester-stimulated burst activity was affected by simulated microgravity. These results demonstrate that simulated microgravity alters an innate cellular function (burst activity).

Cells stably transfected with a p21WAF1/CIP1/MDA6 antisense construct, in marked contrast to their wild-type counterparts, failed to up-regulate p21WAF1/CIP1/MDA6, undergo G1 arrest, or express the maturation marker CD11b when exposed to 1 or 3 mM SB. However, antisense-expressing cells were significantly more susceptible to SB-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis, manifested by increased cytosolic translocation of cytochrome c, activation of pro-caspase 3, and degradation of PARP. Dysregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1/MDA6 did not modify the extent of SB-induced histone acetylation, but did result in cleavage of p27KIP1, Bcl-2 and pRb, as well as diminished levels of full-length underphosphorylated pRb. Finally, dysregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1/MDA6 did not modify SB-mediated down-regulation of E2F-1 or c-Myc, but was associated with enhanced down-regulation of cyclins D1 and E. Together, these findings indicate that in U937 leukemia cells, p21WAF1/CIP1/MDA6 plays a critical functional role in SB-mediated G1 arrest and maturation, and suggest that cells displaying dysregulation of this CDKI respond to SB by engaging a default apoptotic program.","['Rosato, R R', 'Wang, Z', 'Gopalkrishnan, R V', 'Fisher, P B', 'Grant, S']","['Rosato RR', 'Wang Z', 'Gopalkrishnan RV', 'Fisher PB', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism']",2001/06/16 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.19.1.181 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Jul;19(1):181-91. doi: 10.3892/ijo.19.1.181.,,,,"['CA 35675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 74468/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another mechanism is inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase leading to imbalance in the deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) pools. One assay to measure dNTP pools is based on oligonucleotide elongation mediated by DNA polymerase. Since the latter may be affected by dFdCTP, we studied the effect of 0.1-600 pmol dFdCTP on this assay; 10 pmol and more dFdCTP significantly increased the average dpm of the blank (absence of other dNTP) and that of the calibration line of dATP (1.4-1.6-fold); 0.1 pmol and more increased that of the standard dGTP curve significantly (1.1-1.8-fold); 10-75 pmol decreased that of dCTP while 75 and 100 pmol significantly increased that of dCTP (1.3-fold); 50 pmol significantly increased that of dTTP (1.3-1.5-fold). For dATP, dGTP and dTTP, a saturation was reached at 100 pmol dFdCTP, but not yet for dCTP. To minimize these effects, we added an excess of 200 pmol dFdCTP to all samples and calibration lines when measuring dNTP levels of gemcitabine treated samples. In this way the effects of gemcitabine on dNTP levels were studied in human A2780 ovarian, HT29 colon, K562 myelogenous leukemia, H322 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and the murine lung cancer cell line Lewis Lung. In all cell lines, intrinsic dTTP pools (3-77 pmol/106 cells) were the highest, followed by dATP (1.5-31), dCTP (0.7-27) and (nd-14) dGTP. Exposure to 1 and 10 microM gemcitabine for 4-h concentration dependently decreased dATP 3-10-fold and dGTP to undetectable levels, but dCTP at most 3-fold, while dTTP increased. In conclusion, dFdCTP affects dNTP measurements with the DNA polymerase elongation assay, but its effect could be controlled by addition of similar amounts of dFdCTP to each assay.","['Smid, K', 'Van Moorsel, C J', 'Noordhuis, P', 'Voorn, D A', 'Peters, G J']","['Smid K', 'Van Moorsel CJ', 'Noordhuis P', 'Voorn DA', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre (VUMC), PO Box 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",2001/06/16 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Jul;19(1):157-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, human Frizzled-5 (FZD5) gene and cDNAs were cloned and characterized. FZD5 was almost identical to Hfz5, except for six amino-acid substitutions at codon 88, 262, 263, 345, 357, and 402. HF5S1 probe (nucleotide position 2036-2535 of FZD5 cDNA) hybridized to 7.5- and 3.5-kb FZD5 mRNAs, and HF5S2 probe (nucleotide position 5572-6194 of FZD5 cDNA) hybridized only to 7.5-kb FZD5 mRNA. FZD5 cDNA was polyadenylated at the nucleotide position 6534, while several FZD5 ESTs were polyadenylated at the nucleotide position 2561. The 7.5- and 3.5-kb FZD5 mRNAs were transcribed probably due to alternative splicing. FZD5 was highly expressed in fetal liver and adult pancreas, and moderately expressed in fetal lung, kidney and adult liver. Among human cancer cell lines, FZD5 was highly expressed in K-562 cells derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia. FZD5 gene, consisting of two exons, was mapped to human chromosome 2q33.3-q34 region, near the FZD7 gene and the FRA2I fragile site. These results suggest that FZD5 up-regulation might play key roles in chronic myelogenous leukemia through activation of the WNT - beta-catenin - TCF signaling pathway.","['Saitoh, T', 'Hirai, M', 'Katoh, M']","['Saitoh T', 'Hirai M', 'Katoh M']","['Genetics and Cell Biology Section, Genetics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (FZD5 protein, human)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Neurotransmitter)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Frizzled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Library', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Neurotransmitter/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Distribution']",2001/06/16 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.19.1.105 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Jul;19(1):105-10. doi: 10.3892/ijo.19.1.105.,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB043702'],,,,,,,

In contrast, PCR detected the HTLV-I pX region in the same DNA samples as used for Southern blot analysis. These findings suggest two possibilities. One possibility is that ATL in this patient is generated by other pathogens than HTLV-I virus. She is also an HTLV-I carrier. The other possibility is that her leukemic T cell clone derived its malignant phenotype from HTLV-I infection, and once this malignant phenotype was obtained, partial deletions of viral genome repeated until the whole viral genome was deleted.

Cells treated with paclitaxel (250 nm; 6 h) followed by PD98059 [corrected] exhibited a significant increase in mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., cytochrome c release), caspase activation, poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage, and apoptosis, whereas pretreatment of cells with PD98059 reduced lethality. Similar results were obtained with other MEK/MAPK inhibitors (e.g., U0126 and PD184352). Subsequent exposure of paclitaxel-treated cells to PD98059 did not enhance dephosphorylation/activation of p34(cdc2) but diminished expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk opposed potentiation of paclitaxel-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) and apoptosis by PD98059, but not cytochrome c release. Paclitaxel treatment induced sustained phosphorylation/activation of MAPK, an effect prevented by subsequent, but not prior, exposure to PD98059. Paclitaxel treatment also induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, but this effect was enhanced only slightly by subsequent PD98059 administration. Although paclitaxel alone failed to induce p38 MAPK activation, subsequent (but not prior) exposure to PD98059 induced a dramatic increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Moreover, coadministration of the p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 abrogated the increase in paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis induced by PD98059. Finally, subsequent PD98059 exposure increased, whereas prior exposure decreased inhibition of clonogenicity by paclitaxel. Together, these findings suggest that subsequent exposure of paclitaxel-treated U937 cells to MEK/MAPK inhibitors induces perturbations in signaling pathways, particularly the p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK cascades, that lower the threshold for mitochondrial injury and induction of cell death.","['Yu, C', 'Wang, S', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Yu C', 'Wang S', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/06/16 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.60.1.143 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Jul;60(1):143-54. doi: 10.1124/mol.60.1.143.,,,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK528825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['Mol Pharmacol 2001 Aug;60(2):403'],,

Recent evidence suggests that alternate pathways to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade are required. We have previously shown that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) activates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), which is involved in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. In the present study, the contribution of this pathway was investigated in the proliferation of U-937 myeloid leukemia cells. In U-937 cells, fetal bovine serum (FBS)-induced proliferation was attenuated by CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 but not by its inactive analog KN-92. Inhibitors of cPLA2 (methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone) also reduced proliferation of U-937 cells. FBS-induced proliferation was also attenuated by cotransfection with cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides. These results suggest a role for CaM kinase II and cPLA2 in the proliferation of U-937 cells. FBS stimulated CaM kinase II and cPLA2 activities in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, FBS-stimulated phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2 activation was inhibited by KN-93. FBS-stimulated phosphorylation of CaM kinase II was blocked by KN-93 but not by cPLA2 inhibitors, suggesting that CaM kinase II activates cPLA2. The products of phospholipid hydrolysis produced by cPLA2, lysophosphatidylcholine but not arachidonic acid, increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in U-937 cells. These data suggest that exposure of U-937 cells to FBS promotes phosphorylation and activation of CaM kinase II, leading to stimulation of cPLA2 and generation of lysophosphatidylcholine and resultant proliferation of these cells.","['Muthalif, M M', 'Ljuca, F', 'Roaten, J B', 'Pentapaty, N', 'Uddin, M R', 'Malik, K U']","['Muthalif MM', 'Ljuca F', 'Roaten JB', 'Pentapaty N', 'Uddin MR', 'Malik KU']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, The University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '139298-40-1 (KN 93)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Benzylamines/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phospholipases A/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2001/06/16 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2001 Jul;298(1):272-8.,,,,['19134-26/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Node-positive breast cancer patients who were aged 70 years or younger were randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: CMF for six cycles (oral cyclophosphamide); EC for eight cycles (epirubicin 60 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2); day 1 every 3 weeks); and HEC for eight cycles (epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 830 mg/m(2); day 1 every 3 weeks). RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-five, 267, and 255 eligible patients were treated with CMF, EC, and HEC, respectively. Patient characteristics were well balanced among the three arms. One and three cases of congestive heart failure were reported in the EC and HEC arms, respectively. Three cases of acute myeloid leukemia were reported in the HEC arm. After 4 years of median follow-up, no statistically significant differences were observed between HEC and CMF (event-free survival [EFS]: hazards ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.31, P =.80; distant-EFS: HR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.34, P =.87; overall survival [OS]: HR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.44, P =.87).

CONCLUSION: This three-arm study does not show an advantage in favor of an adequately dosed epirubicin-based regimen over classical CMF in the adjuvant therapy of node-positive pre- and postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

To determine the frequency of corticosteroid-associated bony morbidity in children with ALL, we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of fractures and osteonecrosis (ON) on two consecutive pediatric ALL protocols. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-six consecutive children were treated for ALL between 1987 and 1995 at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital. Prednisone was used as the corticosteroid during postremission therapy from 1987 to 1991, and dexamethasone was used from 1991 to 1995. Medical records for all patients were reviewed to assess the occurrence of fractures and ON. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.6 years, the 5-year cumulative incidence (CI) +/- SE of any bony morbidity for the 176 patients was 30% +/- 4%, with a 5-year CI of fractures of 28% +/- 3% and of ON of 7% +/- 2%. With multivariate analysis, independent predictors of bony morbidity included age 9 to 18 years at diagnosis (P <.01), male sex (P <.01), and treatment with dexamethasone (P =.01). Dexamethasone was associated with a higher risk of fractures (5-year CI, 36% +/- 5% v 20% +/- 4% with prednisone; P =.04), but not ON (P =.40). The 5-year event-free survival for the 176 patients was 79% +/- 3%. CONCLUSION: Children treated for ALL had a high incidence of fractures and ON. Older children, boys, and patients receiving dexamethasone were at increased risk for the development of bony morbidity. Future studies should attempt to minimize corticosteroid-associated bony morbidity without compromising clinical efficacy.","['Strauss, A J', 'Su, J T', 'Dalton, V M', 'Gelber, R D', 'Sallan, S E', 'Silverman, L B']","['Strauss AJ', 'Su JT', 'Dalton VM', 'Gelber RD', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","['Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*adverse effects', 'Boston/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/*adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/06/16 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.12.3066 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jun 15;19(12):3066-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.12.3066.,,,,"['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alpha-tocopherol has chemopreventive activity in the head and neck and may decrease 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cRA) toxicity. We designed the present phase II adjuvant trial to prevent recurrence or second primary tumors (SPTs) using 13-cRA, IFN-alpha, and alpha-tocopherol in locally advanced-stage head and neck cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After definitive local treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, or both, patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated with 13-cRA (50 mg/m(2)/d, orally, daily), IFN-alpha (3 x 10(6) IU/m(2), subcutaneous injection, three times a week), and alpha-tocopherol (1,200 IU/d, orally, daily) for 12 months, with a dose modification. Screening for recurrence or SPTs was performed every 3 months. RESULTS: Tumors of 11 (24%) of the 45 treated patients were stage III, and 34 (76%) were stage IV. Thirty-eight (86%) of 44 patients completed the full 12-month treatment (doses modified as needed). Toxicity generally was consistent with previous IFN and 13-cRA reports and included mild to moderate mucocutaneous and flu-like symptoms; occasional significant fatigue (grade 3 in 7% of patients), mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia in 30% of patients who continued treatment along with antilipid therapy, and mild hematologic side effects. Six patients did not complete the planned treatment because of intolerable toxicity or social problems. At a median 24-months of follow-up, our clinical end point rates were 9% for local/regional recurrence (four patients), 5% for local/regional recurrence and distant metastases (two patients), and 2% for SPT (one patient), which was acute promyelocytic leukemia (ie, not of the upper aerodigestive tract). Median 1- and 2-year rates of overall survival were 98% and 91%, respectively, and of disease-free survival were 91% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The novel biologic agent combination of IFN-alpha, 13-cRA, and alpha-tocopherol was generally well tolerated and promising as adjuvant therapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 510 consecutively recruited patients in first chronic phase Ph(1+) CML and pretreatment bone marrow biopsy specimens were entered onto this multicenter observational trial to evaluate the effect of bone marrow histopathology. According to generally accepted criteria, patients with any signs of accelerated disease were excluded. Treatment modalities included administration of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan. Immunohistochemical and morphometric techniques were applied to identify marrow cells and to quantify fiber density. Patients were separated into learning and validation samples, and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed to establish a prognostic decision tree. RESULTS: CART analysis of the validation sample (123 patients with HU therapy) revealed the amount of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, myelofibrosis, and splenomegaly as the most important prognostic features. Three risk profiles with significantly different survival patterns were established, with median survival times ranging from 33 to 108 months (two-sided log-rank test, P =.0001). The new score was confirmed by application to the learning sample with IFN therapy (two-sided log-rank test, P =.0002).

A common C to T transition (C677T) in the MTHFR gene is reported to reduce the risk for colorectal cancer and acute lymphocytic leukemia in homozygotes (TTs). It is hypothesized that because TTs have reduced MTHFR activity, more 5,10-MnTHF is available to provide methyl groups for the conversion of uracil to thymidine. Folic acid deficiency causes the intracellular accumulation of dUMP and the subsequent incorporation of uracil into DNA. The removal of uracil from DNA may result in double-stranded DNA breaks, the accumulation of which is a putative risk factor for cancer. We tested whether human lymphocytes taken from TTs (n = 10) were more able to resist uracil incorporation into DNA than controls (n = 14 CCs and 6 CTs) when cultured in medium containing 12-120 nM folic acid for 9 days. DNA uracil content of these lymphocytes was measured by CG-MS. TTs and controls showed a dose-dependent increase in DNA uracil content during folic acid deficiency (P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.23 for TTs and P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.19 for controls). DNA uracil content was not different between the two groups at any of the folic acid concentrations (two-way ANOVA: media [folic acid], P < 0.0001; genotype, P = 0.4). The results show that, in this in vitro system, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism does not affect the cell's ability to resist uracil incorporation into DNA. Chromosome breakage, as measured by micronuclei, was also shown to correlate with folic acid concentration in a preliminary experiment (P < 0.0001). Although the results appear not to support the hypothesis that a reduced risk for certain cancers in TTs is due to diversion of folic acid to thymidine synthesis, differences between the in vivo and in vitro situation make this conclusion not definitive.","['Crott, J W', 'Mashiyama, S T', 'Ames, B N', 'Fenech, M F']","['Crott JW', 'Mashiyama ST', 'Ames BN', 'Fenech MF']","['Department of Physiology, Adelaide University, SA 5005, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['DNA/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Uracil/*metabolism']",2001/06/16 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/22.7.1019 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2001 Jul;22(7):1019-25. doi: 10.1093/carcin/22.7.1019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effect of capsaicin, an active component of the red pepper of the genus Capsocum, on cell differentiation was investigated in a HL-60 cell culture system. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 5-30 microg/ml capsaicin for 72 h inhibited cell proliferation and induced a small increase in cell differentiation. Interestingly, synergistic induction of HL-60 cell differentiation was observed when capsaicin was combined with either 5 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 or 50 nM all-trans retinoic acid. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that combinations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and capsaicin stimulated differentiation predominantly to monocytes whereas combinations of all-trans retinoic acid and capsaicin stimulated differentiation predominantly to granulocytes.

The likelihood ratio test has been studied for this purpose in the gamma mixture model. However, its asymptotic null distribution is not readily available due to a violation of boundary conditions in the standard asymptotic theory. In this paper, a simulation study is employed to examine a proposed asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood ratio test. We find that the distribution can also be used to approximate the asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood ratio test in the Weibull and log-normal mixture models when the censoring rate is not too light. However, the simulation study also shows that null distribution of the likelihood ratio test deviates significantly from the suggested distribution under moderate sample sizes when the censoring rate is small or the hazard rate is large.

Since cytokine-stimulated stem cells have engrafted poorly in animal models, we investigated phenotypic changes during culture of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). Human CD34(+) HLA-DR(low) cells, immunomagnetically separated from PBPC collections, were found to extrude rhodamine-123, which is characteristic for primitive hematopoietic cells. Cells were grown in suspension cultures supplemented with cytokines. While interleukin-3-containing factor combinations promoted cell proliferation they caused loss of rhodamine-123 extrusion and reduced the frequencies of cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC). Several other cytokines failed to stimulate cell divisions, which are required for retroviral transduction. A combination including Flt-3 ligand (FL), interleukin-6 and stem cell factor (SCF) preserved an immature phenotype for 5 to 6 days and stimulated cell divisions, which was improved upon addition of leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin-11. Furthermore, the CAFC frequency among cells treated with these cytokines was increased as compared with widely used cocktails containing interleukin-3, interleukin-6 and SCF. Rhodamine-123 appeared to be a particularly sensitive indicator for differentiation of PBPC. For analysis of gene transfer, amphotropic retroviruses conferring an MDR1 cDNA were added repeatedly for 6 days to cytokine-treated PBPC stroma-free cultures. Proviral cDNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 68% of cobblestone areas derived from CD34(+)HLA-DR(low) cells that had been exposed to Flt-3 ligand, interleukin-6 and SCF. In summary, conditions were identified that facilitate efficient transduction of early PBPC with amphotropic retroviruses while preserving a primitive phenotype for extended periods.","['Berger, F', 'Soligo, D', 'Schwarz, K', 'Bossolasco, P', 'Schrezenmeier, H', 'Kubanek, B', 'Deliliers, G L', 'Licht, T']","['Berger F', 'Soligo D', 'Schwarz K', 'Bossolasco P', 'Schrezenmeier H', 'Kubanek B', 'Deliliers GL', 'Licht T']","['Fondazione Matarelli, Ospedale Fatebenefratelli e Oftalmico, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Genes, MDR/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*virology', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2001/06/15 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/06/15 10:00'],"['2000/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301455 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2001 May;8(9):687-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301455.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gene rearrangement was analysed by Southern blotting of HindIII digestion products of mononuclear cell DNA, followed by hybridisation with the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia P/S4 probe. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to detect and characterise duplication of the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene. RESULTS: Only one (4%) of 23 children whose marrow or peripheral blood samples contained adequate material for genetic study showed rearrangement in the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene. No children were positive for partial tandem duplication of the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene.

This cleavage was shown to be nuclease-mediated but not TOP2-mediated by the following observations: 1) drug-induced cleavage within the MLL bcr was not protein-linked; 2) unlike TOP2-mediated cleavage, drug-induced DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr was kinetically slow and coincided with the formation of the apoptotic nucleosomal DNA ladder; 3) drug-induced cleavage within the MLL bcr was unaffected in cells with reduced nuclear TOP2; and 4) drug-induced cleavage within the MLL bcr was abolished by the caspase inhibitor, Z-Asp(OCH(3))-Glu(OCH(3))-Val-Asp(OCH(3))-FMK.

The primary cause of the genomic instability is mutation at BLM, which encodes a DNA helicase of the RecQ family. BLM interacts with Topoisomerase IIIalpha (Topo IIIalpha), and both BLM and Topo IIIalpha localize to the nuclear organelles referred to as the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. In this study we show, by analysis of cells that express various deletion constructs of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged BLM, that the first 133 amino acids of BLM are necessary and sufficient for interaction between Topo IIIalpha and BLM. The Topo IIIalpha-interaction domain of BLM is not required for BLM's localization to the PML nuclear bodies; in contrast, Topo IIIalpha is recruited to the PML nuclear bodies via its interaction with BLM. Expression of a full-length BLM (amino acids 1-1417) in BS cells can correct their high SCEs to normal levels, whereas expression of a BLM fragment that lacks the Topo IIIalpha interaction domain (amino acids 133-1417) results in intermediate SCE levels. The deficiency of amino acids 133-1417 in the reduction of SCEs was not explained by a defect in DNA helicase activity, because immunoprecipitated 133-1417 protein had 4-fold higher activity than GFP-BLM. The data implicate the BLM-Topo IIIalpha complex in the regulation of recombination in somatic cells.","['Hu, P', 'Beresten, S F', 'van Brabant, A J', 'Ye, T Z', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Johnson, F B', 'Guarente, L', 'Ellis, N A']","['Hu P', 'Beresten SF', 'van Brabant AJ', 'Ye TZ', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Johnson FB', 'Guarente L', 'Ellis NA']","['Laboratory of Cancer Susceptibility, Department of Human Genetics and the Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Bloom Syndrome/*enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Helicases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/10.12.1287 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2001 Jun 1;10(12):1287-98. doi: 10.1093/hmg/10.12.1287.,,,,"['R01 CA085867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085867-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within a 400 kb recurrently deleted segment at least two minimally deleted subregions had been reported. For the two genes residing in the proximal subregion, initially named LEU1 and LEU2, a pathogenic role has not yet been established. We report here that LEU1 is only a small portion of a large gene, which spans all previously reported critical subregions including the distal subregion. This gene, designated B-cell neoplasia-associated gene with multiple splicing (BCMS), is composed of at least 50 exons spanning >or=560 kb of genomic DNA and is expressed in more than 20 RNA splicing variants. While tissue-specific expression of RNA variants was observed, there was no evidence for the expression of a variant specific for B-CLL. Sequence analysis of the RNA variants suggests that BCMS transcripts belong to the group of non-coding RNAs.

We report that unintegrated viral cDNA is a substrate for the host cell non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which normally repairs cellular double-strand breaks by end ligation. NHEJ activity was found to be required for an end-ligation reaction that circularizes a portion of the unintegrated viral cDNA in infected cells. Consistent with this, the NHEJ proteins Ku70 and Ku80 were found to be bound to purified retroviral replication intermediates. Cells defective in NHEJ are known to undergo apoptosis in response to retroviral infection, a response that we show requires reverse transcription to form the cDNA genome but not subsequent integration. We propose that the double-strand ends present in unintegrated cDNA promote apoptosis, as is known to be the case for chromosomal double-strand breaks, and cDNA circularization removes the pro-apoptotic signal.","['Li, L', 'Olvera, J M', 'Yoder, K E', 'Mitchell, R S', 'Butler, S L', 'Lieber, M', 'Martin, S L', 'Bushman, F D']","['Li L', 'Olvera JM', 'Yoder KE', 'Mitchell RS', 'Butler SL', 'Lieber M', 'Martin SL', 'Bushman FD']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, The Salk Institute, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Apoptosis', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cricetinae', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA, Viral/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Integration']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/20.12.3272 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Jun 15;20(12):3272-81. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.12.3272.,PMC150207,,,"['R01 AI034786/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI34786/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM56553/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), particularly of B-lineage, are resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Using leukemia lines derived from patients with pro-B t(4;11), pre-B, and T-cell ALL, we show in this report that resveratrol induces extensive apoptotic cell death not only in CD95-sensitive leukemia lines, but also in B-lineage leukemic cells that are resistant to CD95-signaling. Multiple dose treatments of the leukemic cells with 50 microM resveratrol resulted in >/=80% cell death with no statistically significant cytotoxicity against normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells under identical conditions. Resveratrol treatment did not increase CD95 expression or trigger sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis in the ALL lines. Inhibition of CD95-signaling with a CD95-specific antagonistic antibody indicated that CD95-CD95 ligand interactions were not involved in initiating resveratrol-induced apoptosis. However, in each ALL line, resveratrol induced progressive loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by the dual emission pattern of the mitochondria-selective dye JC-1. The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone failed to block the depolarization of mitochondrial membranes induced by resveratrol, further indicating that resveratrol action was independent of upstream caspase-8 activation via receptor ligation. However, increases in caspase-9 activity ranged from 4- to 9-fold in the eight cell lines after treatment with resveratrol. Taken together, these results point to a general mechanism of apoptosis induction by resveratrol in ALL cells that involves a mitochondria/caspase-9-specific pathway for the activation of the caspase cascade and is independent of CD95-signaling.","['Dorrie, J', 'Gerauer, H', 'Wachter, Y', 'Zunino, S J']","['Dorrie J', 'Gerauer H', 'Wachter Y', 'Zunino SJ']","['The Chair of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, D91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jun 15;61(12):4731-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cell lines refractory to standard retinoids suggests a retinoid-independent mechanism of action for AHPN. Conformational studies suggested that binding of AHPN does not induce an unusual conformation in retinoic acid receptor (RAR) gamma. The 3-chloro AHPN analogue MM11453 inhibited the growth of both retinoid-resistant (HL-60R leukemia, MDA-MB-231 breast, and H292 lung) and retinoid-sensitive (MCF-7 breast, LNCaP prostate, and H460 lung) cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis at similar concentrations. Before apoptosis, MM11453 induced transcription factor TR3 expression and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential characteristic of apoptosis. MM11453 lacked the ability to significantly activate RARs and retinoid X receptor alpha to initiate (TREpal)(2)-tk-CAT reporter transcription. These results, differential proteolysis-sensitivity assays, and glutathione S-transferase-pulldown experiments demonstrate that, unlike AHPN or the natural or standard synthetic retinoids, MM11453 does not behave as a RAR or retinoid X receptor alpha transcriptional agonist. These studies strongly suggest that AHPN exerts its cell cycle arrest and apoptotic activity by a signaling pathway independent of retinoid receptor activation.","['Dawson, M I', 'Hobbs, P D', 'Peterson, V J', 'Leid, M', 'Lange, C W', 'Feng, K C', 'Chen Gq', 'Gu, J', 'Li, H', 'Kolluri, S K', 'Zhang Xk', 'Zhang, Y', 'Fontana, J A']","['Dawson MI', 'Hobbs PD', 'Peterson VJ', 'Leid M', 'Lange CW', 'Feng KC', 'Chen Gq', 'Gu J', 'Li H', 'Kolluri SK', 'Zhang Xk', 'Zhang Y', 'Fontana JA']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Medicine Research Institute, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (MM11453)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Retinoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jun 15;61(12):4723-30.,,,,['P01 CA51993/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all of these, this translocation results in deregulated expression of the gene product because of the proximity of IgH. We present here the molecular characterization of a previously reported acute lymphoblastic leukemia case carrying a t(9;12)(q11;p13) translocation. Using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR, a novel chimeric transcript was identified that contained the NH(2)-terminal region of PAX5 and most of the ETV6/TEL gene on 12p13. According to the fusion transcript, the resulting chimeric protein would retain the PAX5 paired-box domain and both the helix-loop-helix and DNA binding domains of TEL.

The nuclear morphology, agarose gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry of these cells showed that they undergo apoptosis. The activity of caspase-3 was observed in cells subjected to each stress. In particular, caspase-3 was most readily activated by high pressure under our conditions. The caspase-3 activity and apoptosis exhibited a similar pressure dependence. It is important that both caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induced by high pressure were significantly suppressed by a caspase-3 inhibitor.

OBSERVATION: We describe 3 newborns with Down syndrome and vesiculopustular eruptions associated with myeloproliferative disorders during the neonatal period. These lesions differ from other neonatal vesicular eruptions in that they have a unique distribution, display pathergy, and contain immature hematopoietic cells similar to circulating blast cells. Resolution occurs without treatment as the hematologic disorder subsides. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with Down syndrome and hematologic abnormalities may have a cutaneous eruption that has characteristic clinical and histopathologic findings. It is possible that this eruption has been unrecognized in the past because of its self-limited course.

A very large number of experimental investigations of benzene metabolism have been conducted with animals, both in vivo and in vitro. There have also been many investigations of benzene metabolism in humans and with human tissues, Although the blood or tissue concentrations of benzene metabolites in humans resulting from benzene exposure have never been measured. Further, a number of mathematical models of benzene metabolism and dosimetry have been developed.

The relative levels of these two transcripts were analyzed in 5 normal and 43 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bone marrow (BM) specimens by a semiquantitative RT-PCR method. IRF-1 and IRF-2 cDNA sequences were coamplified using primers that were designed to span regions of high homology between the genes. Each primer can anneal equally to both IRF-1 and IRF-2 sequences. Hence, the relative amount of amplified products from each cDNA species provides an estimation of proportional concentration of the RNA transcripts in the test sample. Results indicate expression of both the transcripts on all the leukemia and lymphoma cell lines tested, normal and AML BM. Significantly higher IRF-1:IRF-2 ratio was observed in normal as compared to AML BM (p = 0.007). There was no correlation with clinical factors such as FAB subtype. A single dose of amifostine or three daily doses of recombinant IL-4 were administered to 5 and 8 AML patients, respectively. The changes in the expression of these transcripts were studied prior to administration of the agent (d0) and after 3 days (d3).

During vertebrate hematopoiesis, FOG and GATA proteins cooperate to promote erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation. The Drosophila FOG homologue U-shaped (Ush) is expressed similarly in the blood cell anlage during embryogenesis. During hematopoiesis, the acute myeloid leukemia 1 homologue Lozenge and Glial cells missing are required for the production of crystal cells and plasmatocytes, respectively. However, additional factors have been predicted to control crystal cell proliferation. In this report, we show that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis and larval development, and the GATA factor Serpent is essential for Ush embryonic expression. Furthermore, loss of ush function results in an overproduction of crystal cells, whereas forced expression of Ush reduces this cell population. Murine FOG-1 and FOG-2 also can repress crystal cell production, but a mutant version of FOG-2 lacking a conserved motif that binds the corepressor C-terminal binding protein fails to affect the cell lineage. The GATA factor Pannier (Pnr) is required for eye and heart development in Drosophila. When Ush, FOG-1, FOG-2, or mutant FOG-2 is coexpressed with Pnr during these developmental processes, severe eye and heart phenotypes result, consistent with a conserved negative regulation of Pnr function. These results indicate that the fly and mouse FOG proteins function similarly in three distinct cellular contexts in Drosophila, but may use different mechanisms to regulate genetic events in blood vs. cardial or eye cell lineages.","['Fossett, N', 'Tevosian, S G', 'Gajewski, K', 'Zhang, Q', 'Orkin, S H', 'Schulz, R A']","['Fossett N', 'Tevosian SG', 'Gajewski K', 'Zhang Q', 'Orkin SH', 'Schulz RA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate Program in Genes and Development, The University of Texas M.

Recent work indicates that statins strongly reduce the possibility of heart attack. Furthermore, these compounds appear to exert beneficial effects not only by lowering plasma low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol but also by directly affecting the artery wall. To evaluate whether statins influence the proinflammatory responses of monocytic cells, we studied their effects on the chemotactic migration and MMP-9 secretion of human monocytic cell line THP-1. Simvastatin dose dependently inhibited THP-1 cell migration mediated by monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 50 nM. It also inhibited bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of MMP-9. The effects of simvastatin were completely reversed by mevalonate and its derivatives, farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by ubiquinone.

In this overview we summarize data that points to a role of activin A in negative regulation of B lineage lymphocytes. Experiments performed by us and by other groups revealed the capacity of activin A to cause apoptotic death of tumor myeloma cells, through mechanisms of cell cycle inhibition and antagonism with the survival signal of interleukin-6. In vitro studies on B lymphocyte generation from bone marrow stem cells and use of human nasal polyps as a model of inflamed tissue further demonstrate an inhibitory role of activin A in B cell spread and accumulation. These data are analyzed with respect to our model of tissue organization that we term the ""restrictin model of cell growth regulation."" This model assumes a morphogen-like role of activin A in the hematopoietic system. Thus, the relative concentration of biologically functional activin A, in different parts of the tissue, may determine the local B cell content and functional state of these cells within a specific microenvironment.","['Zipori, D', 'Barda-Saad, M']","['Zipori D', 'Barda-Saad M']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. dov.zipori@weizmann.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Follistatin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (restrictin-P)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Follistatin', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Nasal Polyps/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2001 Jun;69(6):867-73.,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: MSI analysis revealed a high frequency of multiple microsatellite changes in the exposed patients (84.6%) compared with non-exposed patients (8.3%). There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the two groups.

Also, to relate doses to relative risks of osteosarcoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computer-based image analysis of neutron-induced and alpha-track autoradiographs of sections of mouse femora was used to quantify the microdistribution of (239)Pu, (241)Am and (233)U from 1 to 448 days after intraperitoneal injection. Localized dose-rates and cumulative doses over this period were calculated for different regions of the marrow spaces in trabecular bone. The results were then combined with previous data for doses to the cortical marrow of the femoral shaft. A morphometric analysis of the distal femur was carried out. RESULTS: Initial deposition on endosteal surfaces and dose-rates near to the trabecular surfaces at 1 day were two to four times greater than corresponding results for cortical bone. Burial was most rapid for (233)U, about twice the rate in cortical bone. As in cortical bone, subsequent uptake into the marrow was seen for (239)Pu and (241)Am but not (233)U. Cumulative doses to 448 days for different regions of trabecular marrow were greater than corresponding values for cortical marrow for each radionuclide. Combined doses reflected the greater overall volume of cortical marrow. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative radiation doses to the 10 microm thick band of marrow adjacent to all endosteal surfaces were in the ratio of approximately 7:3:1 for (239)Pu:(241)Am:(233)U. This ratio is not inconsistent with observed incidences of osteosarcoma induction by the three nuclides. Analysis of doses to different depths of marrow, however, showed that although ratios were probably not significantly different to that for a 10 microm depth, better correlations with osteosarcomagenic risk were obtained with 20-40 microm depths. For acute myeloid leukaemia, the closest relationship between relative risk and doses was obtained by considering only the central 5-10% of marrow, which gave a dose ratio of approximately 12:11:1 for (239)Pu:(241)Am:(233)U respectively.","['Lord, B I', 'Austin, A L', 'Ellender, M', 'Haines, J W', 'Harrison, J D']","['Lord BI', 'Austin AL', 'Ellender M', 'Haines JW', 'Harrison JD']","['CRC Experimental Haematology Group, Paterson Institute Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Wilmslow Manchester M20 4BX, UK. blord@picr.man.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)', 'VW92PHU2UY (Americium)']",IM,"['Americium/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Femur/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Osteosarcoma/etiology', 'Plutonium/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Radiometry', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Uranium/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity']",2001/06/14 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/14 10:00'],"['2001/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530000110045944 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Jun;77(6):665-78. doi: 10.1080/095530000110045944.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDR1 abnormality was detected more frequently in the elderly patients(68%) than in younger AML patients(38%). We speculated that the laboratory features of the elderly AML patients may be related to the aging of bone marrow and the effects of environmental factors.","['Mori, M']",['Mori M'],"['Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-0015.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Clinical and pathogenic aspects].,452-9,"INTRODUCTION: The clinical course, biological features, and recent data on the pathogenesis of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia are reviewed. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Clonal diseases of LGL disorders can arise from a CD3+, CD57+ T-cell lineage, which are the most frequent, or from a CD3-, CD56+ NK-cell lineage. The diagnosis of LGL leukemia is suspected on the basis of a persistent excess of LGL, usually with neutropenia and splenomegaly. It is assessed by immunophenotypic and molecular studies of T-cell receptor clonality (southern blot, PCR). Association with autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, erythroblastopenia, etc.) is a main feature of chronic LGL proliferation. Questions about a viral agent (HTLV1?), facilitation of clonal expansion by cytokines (IL-12, IL-15), and the defective Fas apoptotic pathway are discussed. Treatment of symptomatic LGL proliferations is based on immunosuppressive agents (principally methotrexate and cyclophosphamide). FUTURE PROSPECT AND PROJECTS: The epidemiology, prognosis factors, therapeutics and the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia are unknown. We proposed the creation of a French register of LGL expansions to explore these different aspects.","['Hamidou, M', 'Lamy, T']","['Hamidou M', 'Lamy T']","['Service de medecine interne A, Hotel-Dieu, CHU, place Alexis-Ricordeau, 44035 Nantes, France. mohamed.hamidou@chu-nantes.fr']",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/complications', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'France/epidemiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Splenomegaly', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",2001/06/14 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/14 10:00'],"['2001/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0248866301003708 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(01)00370-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2001 May;22(5):452-9. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(01)00370-8.,,,,,45,Proliferations chroniques a grands lymphocytes granuleux.

In this study, we demonstrate that Bcl-2 expression is activated in the majority of F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia cell lines. In contrast, Bcl-2 was not expressed in any of the FV-P-induced erythroleukemia cell lines and protein levels were low or negligible in FV-A-induced erythroleukemia cell lines examined. In vivo, Bcl-2 expression levels gradually increased in F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemic cells prior to adaptation to culture. High expression of Bcl-2 in F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemic cells was shown to proceed the emergence of p53 mutation suggesting that Bcl-2 expression may delay p53 mutation in the leukemic cells. This is further supported by the demonstration that the majority of F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia cell lines established from primary tumors induced in p53 mutant mice express low to negligible levels of Bcl-2. We have shown that the high levels of Bcl-2 expression in FV-P-induced erythroleukemic cells inhibited apoptosis induced by etoposide, low serum and p53 expression. Similarly, ectopic Bcl-2 expression within these cells also provided protection from apoptosis induced by etoposide and growth in low serum. These results suggest that the anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-2 may confer a selective in vivo and in vitro growth advantage to F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemic cells, which is not shared by FV-P/FV-A-induced erythroleukemic cells. The observed induction of Bcl-2 expression in vivo constitutes a novel but late oncogenic event associated with the progression of F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemias.","['Howard, J C', 'Li, Q', 'Chu, W', 'Zochodne, B', 'Kapoor, M', 'Ung, Y', 'Rosen, K', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Howard JC', 'Li Q', 'Chu W', 'Zochodne B', 'Kapoor M', 'Ung Y', 'Rosen K', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Division of Cancer Biology, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre & Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/physiology']",2001/06/13 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/06/13 10:00'],"['2000/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2001/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204348 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Apr 26;20(18):2291-300. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the results on buccal cell genotyping from our ongoing study of childhood leukemia in Northern California. We have collected buccal samples from children ranging in age from 4 months to 15 years using an interviewer- or nurse-administered protocol using a cytology brush. Initial results of the genotyping, including the glutathione S-transferase mu, glutathione S-transferase theta, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms, were disappointing because many specimens contained little DNA, failed repeated attempts at PCR amplification, and produced unreliable results. Here we evaluate a solution to the problem that involves whole genome amplification using the improved primer extension preamplification methodology. Sixty cases of pediatric acute leukemia were studied; five PCR-based genotypes were attempted using buccal cell DNA and whole genome amplified (WGA) buccal DNA. Results were compared with genotyping results using DNA isolated from peripheral whole blood or bone marrow for each child. The standard buccal protocol failed to yield successful PCR reactions in 30-57% of specimens, whereas WGA-buccal was markedly more efficient (2-5% failed PCR). A success rate of 100% was achieved with one repeat test of the failed WGA-PCR reactions. Misclassification of genotype was common for the glutathione S-transferase theta marker using the standard buccal procedure. The WGA-buccal protocol, however, produced genotyping results fully concordant with the referent blood or bone marrow DNA results for all five loci. DNA yields were increased by WGA to allow for approximately 900 PCR reactions/brush. WGA is very useful for improving the efficiency and validity of PCR-based genotyping in pediatric populations.","['Zheng, S', 'Ma, X', 'Buffler, P A', 'Smith, M T', 'Wiencke, J K']","['Zheng S', 'Ma X', 'Buffler PA', 'Smith MT', 'Wiencke JK']","['Laboratory for Molecular Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143-0560, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Data Collection', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Mouth Mucosa/cytology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specimen Handling']",2001/06/13 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/13 10:00'],"['2001/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2001 Jun;10(6):697-700.,,,,"['ES06717/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42-ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison with other clinicopathologic presentations of mantle cell lymphoma.,256-64,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) is a lymphocyte homing receptor selectively expressed by T cells of the cutaneous immune system and their malignant counterpart, that is to say, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. However it is absent in the vast mayority of other T-cell malignancies and B-cell lineage lymphomas irrespective on primary tumor site. METHODS: Expression of CLA was investigated on six cases of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) which differed in their histopathological subtype (typical or blastic) and their tendency to infiltrate skin and/or central nervous system (CNS). RESULTS: CLA immunostaining on neoplastic cells was only observed in a 61-year-old female suffering from a lymphoblastoid MCL which clinically presented with specific skin lesions and further developped CNS disease. In this patient, coexpression of CLA with MCL markers (CD20 and CD5) was confirmed by conventional immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence studies. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, CLA immunoreactivity on B-cell lymphomas has not beeen previously reported. The expression of this skin-related adhesion molecule on malignant MCL cells could explain the clinical behavior of our case which presented and relapsed with cutaneous lesions. However, CLA seems not to be a MCL marker nor a CNS-related adhesion molecule. The authors review the clinical and histopathological characteristics of MCL-specific skin lesions and their diagnostic clues based on cell morphology, immunohistochemistry and molecular investigations.","['Marti, R M', 'Campo, E', 'Bosch, F', 'Palou, J', 'Estrach, T']","['Marti RM', 'Campo E', 'Bosch F', 'Palou J', 'Estrach T']","['Department of Dermatology, Hospital Clinic i Provincial de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. rmarti@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CTAGE1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",2001/06/13 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/13 10:00'],"['2001/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['cup280505 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0560.2001.028005256.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2001 May;28(5):256-64. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0560.2001.028005256.x.,,,,['P30-AR41940/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, the encoded protein is homologous with members of the 3' to 5' exonuclease superfamily that includes RNases T and D, and the proofreading domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. We provide here direct biochemical evidence that Isg20 acts as a 3' to 5' exonuclease in vitro. This protein displays a pH optimum of approximately 7.0, prefers Mn2+ as a metal cofactor, and degrades RNA at a rate that is approximately 35-fold higher than its rate for single-stranded DNA. Along with RNase L, Isg20 is the second known RNase regulated by interferon. Previous data showed that Isg20 is located in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, known sites of hormone-dependent RNA polymerase II transcription and oncogenic DNA viral transcription and replication. The combined data suggest a potential role for Isg20 in degrading viral RNAs as part of the interferon-regulated antiviral response and/or cellular mRNAs as a regulatory component of interferon and estrogen signaling.","['Nguyen, L H', 'Espert, L', 'Mechti, N', 'Wilson, D M 3rd']","['Nguyen LH', 'Espert L', 'Mechti N', 'Wilson DM 3rd']","['Molecular and Structural Biology Division, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P.O.

Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for LIF in regulating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, but information is limited regarding whether the cytokine also exerts a significant influence on other endocrine systems. In this study, we examined a possible involvement of LIF in the generation of ovarian steroid-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) surges in the rat. Experiments were performed on both normally fed and 3-day-fasted rats, which were ovariectomized and primed with estradiol and progesterone. From 11:00 to 18:00 h, blood was collected every 30 min to measure LH and PRL. All the following substances were given intracerebroventricularly at 11:00 h. Compared to control serum, undiluted and 5-times diluted preparations of anti-rat LIF serum caused a partial but significant suppression of LH surge to a similar extent. The two different concentrations of antibody also delayed the onset of PRL surge to a comparable degree. Fasted rats were devoid of significant surges of the hormones, while 1.0 and 3.0 nmol, but not 0.3 nmol, of recombinant murine LIF given to these animals led to a partial but significant recovery of both LH and PRL surges. This stimulatory potency of LIF on both hormones was already maximal at its 1.0-nmol dose. These results demonstrate for the first time a significant participation of LIF in the generation of LH and PRL surges in the rat. A novel action of the pleiotropic cytokine is reported herein.","['Watanobe, H', 'Yoneda, M']","['Watanobe H', 'Yoneda M']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Center for Clinical Research, International University of Health and Welfare, 2600-1 Kitakanemaru, Otawara, Tochigi, 324-8501, Japan. watah@iuhw.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/administration & dosage', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/physiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Fasting/blood', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Injections, Intraventricular', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leptin/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Lymphokines/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Ovariectomy', 'Prolactin/blood', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reproduction/*physiology']",2001/06/13 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/13 10:00'],"['2001/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.4614 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)94614-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Mar 30;282(2):643-6. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.4614.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we report on the case of a breast cancer patient with lung and liver metastases who developed acute myeloid leukemia after treatment with Di Bella multitherapy, leading rapidly to death due to cerebral hemorrhage. Although an increased susceptibility to malignancy could not be excluded, we considered the possible etiologic role of the treatment received. The drug most likely to be associated with the development of leukemia was the cyclophosphamide contained in the Di Bella multitherapy regimen at a dose of 50 mg daily. The clinical features of this leukemia were therefore compared with those expected for secondary leukemia related to alkylating agents. A preceding myelodysplastic phase and the development of the leukemia after the intake of a cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of 15 g were typical chacteristics of secondary leukemia, but the interval between the start of therapy and the onset of leukemia was only 10 months. We conclude that long-term low-dose cyclophosphamide may have leukemogenic potential and the latency period may be shorter than that commonly reported.","['Sacco, C', 'Patriarca, F']","['Sacco C', 'Patriarca F']","['Division of Oncology, Santa Maria Hospital, Udine, Italy. oncologia@aoud.sanita.fvg.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced']",2001/06/13 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/06/13 10:00'],"['2001/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2001 Mar-Apr;87(2):101-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is an acquired, irreversible disorder of ineffective hematopoiesis, characterized by stem cell dysfunction as a consequence of DNA damage manifested in part by karyotype anomalies. Importantly, MA and MDS are generally considered mutually exclusive diagnoses. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with a profound macrocytic anemia, monocytosis and neurologic symptoms. Low cobalamin levels and the presence of anti-intrinsic-factor antibodies definitively established a diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Replacement therapy resulted in resolution of neurologic findings and macrocytosis; however, the anemia and monocytosis persisted. Bone marrow biopsy revealed trilineage myelodysplasia, which together with the peripheral monocytosis suggested a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Karyotype analysis revealed a clone with 45, XX, +der(1;7)(q10;p10)-7 [20]. Eighteen months after documented vitamin B12 replenishment her MDS transformed to terminal acute myeloid leukemia with the same clonal abnormality. Reversible cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed with MA, occasionally including karyotypes typically associated with MDS or myeloid leukemias. These abnormalities, like the anemia, resolve with vitamin replacement. This case suggests that MA and MDS can occur simultaneously; clinicians should be aware that this phenomenon occurs. Whether acquired karyotype abnormalities from the MA were related to the MDS and subsequent myeloid leukemia in this woman is a speculative but intriguing consideration that is discussed.","['Drabick, J J', 'Davis, B J', 'Byrd, J C']","['Drabick JJ', 'Davis BJ', 'Byrd JC']","['Hematology/Oncology Service, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307-5000, USA. joseph.drabick@na.amedd.army.mil']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '9008-12-2 (Intrinsic Factor)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Pernicious/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intrinsic Factor/immunology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Vitamin B 12/blood/therapeutic use']",2001/06/13 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/13 10:00'],"['2001/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770000272 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001 Apr;80(4):243-5. doi: 10.1007/s002770000272.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, the patient developed avascular necrosis (AVN) in the right femoral head. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels were high at the onset of arthralgia but low during remission, and levels of interferon-gamma were undetectable throughout the period of arthralgia.

Because information on male potency in particular is scanty, we prospectively assessed male sexual function after autoBMT. We identified 16 men who were < or =50 years of age at the time of evaluation and disease free for at least 6 months after autoBMT. Nine had Hodgkin's disease, 4 had acute myelogenous leukemia, and 3 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Blood samples were assayed for luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone. Patients were surveyed with a modified version of the Pyschosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale regarding erectile dysfunction and loss of interest in sexual activities. Seventy five percent of the men reported normal interest in sexual activities and 87.5% reported normal erectile function; however, 4 of 16 reported a moderate loss of interest in sexual activities, and another 2 of 16 reported frequent loss of erectile function. All 4 men with decreased libido and both men with impaired erectile function had Hodgkin's disease. Fourteen (88%) of 16 patients had an elevated FSH level, 7 (47%) of 15 had elevated LH, and 6 (38%) of 16 had decreased testosterone levels. Decreased testosterone levels correlated with a moderate or total loss of libido (P = .008) and a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease (P = .01). Thus, after transplantation, most men have abnormal levels of gonadotrophins. Decreased levels of testosterone and symptoms of sexual dysfunction correlated with a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease and may be related to the induction and salvage therapy received prior to autoBMT.","['Schimmer, A D', 'Ali, V', 'Stewart, A K', 'Imrie, K', 'Keating, A']","['Schimmer AD', 'Ali V', 'Stewart AK', 'Imrie K', 'Keating A']","['Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Long-Term Follow-up Research Unit, The Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. aaron.schimmer@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Data Collection', 'Erectile Dysfunction/blood/*etiology', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*adverse effects']",2001/06/13 10:00,2002/02/08 10:01,['2001/06/13 10:00'],"['2001/06/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(01)50045-2 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2001.v7.pm11400950 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2001;7(5):279-83. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2001.v7.pm11400950.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthesis and bioevaluation of three open chain analogues of 1b-d, namely 3a-c, did not reveal unequivocally whether this molecular modification led to increases in cytotoxicity or not. Compounds 2a-d were substantially more active than melphalan using a panel of human tumour cell lines.

It has been proposed that patients with a hematologic malignancy who are receiving frequent RBC transfusions should be screened for HFE mutations. This would identify C282Y homozygotes, who have a high risk of developing severe iron overload. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DNA samples from 128 controls and 23 adult long-term survivors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated at the Oulu University Hospital (Oulu, Finland) from 1987 to 2000 were examined for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE. All the patients were severely iron-overloaded, as determined from high serum ferritin values and/or increased storage iron in bone marrow. Phlebotomies were performed in five patients because of the symptoms of iron overload. DNA extracted from the blood was used to amplify HFE gene fragments by the PCR method, after which the amplification products were digested with restriction endonucleases SnaB I and Bcl I, and the restriction fragments were analyzed on agarose gels. RESULTS: No chromosomes with the C282Y mutation were found among the AML patients, and 5 patients (21.7%) were heterozygous for the H63D mutation. In the control group, 13 persons (10.2%) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation and 26 (20.3%) for the H63D mutation, including 3 C282Y/H63D double heterozygotes.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Reported here is a cohort study of 153 patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass graft or coronary valve replacement surgery by two surgeons in one institution during 1997 and 1998. All statistics employed nonparametric two-sided tests (Mann-Whitney; Fisher's exact test). RESULTS: Patients receiving at least one ABO-mismatched pool of platelets had a significantly longer hospital stay, more days of fever, greater total hospital charges, and more RBC transfusions. Mortality, hours in the intensive care unit, days on antibiotics, and numbers of platelet transfusions were also greater in recipients of ABO-mismatched platelets, but these differences were of less statistical significance. When the analysis was restricted to the 139 patients who received no more than two pools of platelets, the trends for increased morbidity and mortality (8.6% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.10) in recipients of ABO-mismatched platelets persisted. The number of RBC transfusions required in this latter cohort was 50 percent greater (mean, 6.1 vs. 9.2; p = 0.02), despite the fact that the number of platelet transfusions given was similar (mean, 1.2 vs. 1.3 pools; p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: ABO-mismatched platelet transfusions are associated with unfavorable outcomes in cardiac surgery, a relationship that remains unexplained. As this association has been found in three cohort studies in various clinical settings, further investigation of this association is warranted.","['Blumberg, N', 'Heal, J M', 'Hicks, G L Jr', 'Risher, W H']","['Blumberg N', 'Heal JM', 'Hicks GL Jr', 'Risher WH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.

In this study we measured serum levels of GM-CSF and IL-3 at diagnosis and after remission in children with acute leukaemia, using an enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) techniques in 14 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 27 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Twelve healthy age-matched children were used as a reference group. AML patients showed a highly significant increase in serum levels of GM-CSF and IL-3 before induction of therapy (p < 0.0001) compared to the reference control group, with a highly significant decline of both GM-CSF and IL-3 (p < 0.0001) after successful remission. On the other hand, ALL patients showed no significant elevation of GM-CSF and IL-3 at diagnosis (p > 0.5), with no significant difference between preinduction and postinduction serum levels of either (p > 0.5). Since these cytokines are known to be fundamental for the growth of AML cells, we postulate that the pretreatment levels of both GM-CSF and IL-3 could play a role in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Elbaz, Osama', 'Shaltout, Ali']","['Elbaz O', 'Shaltout A']","['Haematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:00,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['I458E001045 [pii]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2001;5(5):383-388.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level, this aberration rearranges the gene for the AML1-transcription factor on chromosome 21, which is essential for normal hematopoiesis, to the MTG8 gene on chromosome 8, thereby leading to a specific AML1/MTG8 fusion mRNA. This fusion gene is involved in leukemogenesis presumably by interfering with normal AML1-dependent transcriptional regulation. AML patients with t(8;21) have a favourable response to chemotherapy and a relatively good prognosis after intensive consolidation treatment with high dose AraC or autologous stem cell transplantation. RT-PCR for the specific AML1/MTG8 fusion transcripts can be used for the sensitive detection of residual leukemic cells during and after therapy. However, since a considerable proportion of these patients shows a positive PCR result even in long-term complete hematological remission, the prognostic value of qualitative PCR methods is doubtful. In contrast, quantitative PCR methods might be able to identify patients with a high risk of relapse by serial quantification of minimal residual disease (MRD). Because of its high degree of standardisation and automation, the recently developed real time PCR method can be used for the valid and reproducible detection of MRD in large prospective trials. This technology offers the potential to define the antileukemic efficiency of different treatment elements and the prognostic value of MRD in patients with t(8;21) positive AML.","['Krauter, JUrgen', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Krauter J', 'Heil G', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:00,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['I458E001041 [pii]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2001;5(5):369-381.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that 30 out of 50 patients (60%) were negative (Group 1) and 20 (40%) were positive (Group 2) for P-gp expression evaluated by mean of MRK16 MoAb using a cut-off of 10% positive cells. Thirty-five out of 50 patients (70%) obtained complete remission (CR); depending on P-gp expression, the CR rate was 80% for group 1 and 45% for group 2 (p < 0.005). The median duration of overall survival was 20 months for patients in Group 1 as compared with 10 months for patients of Group 2 (p < 0.005). Regarding the anthracycline used, no significant difference in CR was observed in patients of Group 1 (75% of CR with DNR vs. 90% with IDR); Group 2 obtained 40% of CR with DNR vs. 70% with IDR (p < 0.005). The median duration of overall survival (OS) with the two regimens was comparable in Group 1, while it was significantly longer in patients of Group 2 treated with IDR compared with DNR regimen (p < 0.005). These results confirm the prognostic value of P-gp expression in AML at first appearance and we suggest that idarubicin could be a valid anthracycline drug in the treatment of AML to be evaluated as potential drug of choice in patients with primary or drug-induced multidrug resistance.","['Pogliani, E.

The selection of patients remains a major problem because this is a disease of elderly patients with a median overall survival of 7 years and will only therefore be applicable to a minority of patients. However transplantation is the most likely therapeutic option at this time to lead to cure in this condition. The best type of transplant is not known and not all patients will be able to mobilise adequate numbers of stem cells or have a suitable donor identified. Autologous transplantation relies on the ability of high doses of chemotherapy to eradicate disease whilst allogeneic transplantation attempts to harvest the graft versus leukaemia effect that has been identified in chronic granulocytic leukaemia. However, the high treatment related mortality and morbidity of allogeneic transplants has led to interest in the use of non-myeloablative allografts which hope to maximise the immunological effects of transplantation to achieve durable remissions. To date there have been no randomised clinical trials to compare the efficacy of combination chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic transplants and this is unlikely to happen in the near future. Other issues that need to be addressed include the timing of transplantation, the source of stem cells, the optimal conditioning regimen and the role of immunomodulation post transplantation.

There are several potential roles for the use of growth factors in the management of patients with AML, including reduction in the infective complications associated with the underlying disease and its treatment, use as mobilising agents in stem cell transplantation and as priming agents with chemotherapy. Clinical trials have failed to give clear indications for the use of growth factors following chemotherapy, mainly due to the variability of patient populations, chemotherapy and growth factor schedules used. G-CSF appears to be associated with no negative impact on remission rate or survival but clear benefits in terms of infection-related endpoints were not universally seen. Three studies did show a reduction in duration of hospitalisation, particularly when G-CSF was used following consolidation chemotherapy and economic analyses have also shown financial advantages to the administration of G-CSF. GM-CSF had a variable impact on survival and only two studies demonstrated reduction in serious infections or antimicrobial therapy use. These trials also showed economic benefits for the use of GM-CSF. Clinical studies which have attempted to exploit possible potentiation of chemotherapeutic activity by recruitment of leukaemic cells into the cell cycle have generally been disappointing. Use of growth factors for this purpose, outside the context of randomised clinical trials cannot be recommended. GM-CSF may have a role in modulating the cellular immune response against cancer cells but experimental data on its activity against leukaemia cells is limited. Augmentation of white cell function by G-CSF or GM-CSF may also be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or confirmed fungal infection and further trials are underway.","['Richardson, Deborah S.', 'Newland, Adrian C.']","['Richardson DS', 'Newland AC']","[""Department of Haematology, St. Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['I458E001015 [pii]', '10.1080/10245332.2000.11746508 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2000;5(3):189-203. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2000.11746508.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These new insights have revolutionized our ability to diagnose and to formulate prognoses for patients with cancer, and have inspired the design and development of novel therapeutic strategies that are based on modern gene-transfer technologies and act at the gene level. Gene therapy, broadly defined as the introduction of genetic material (transgenes) into a patient's cells with an intent to confer a therapeutic benefit, represents the most direct application of recombinant DNA technology in the clinical setting. The challenging concept of modifying the genetic properties of human cells captivated very quickly the interest of clinical and molecular oncologists, and currently, numerous gene therapy clinical trials in cancer patients are under investigation worldwide. Most of these studies involve manipulating the patient's immune response to tumors. The identification of tumor-specific antigens stimulating humoral and cellular responses in cancer patients, together with a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling T cell activation have dramatically accelerated the search for potent cancer vaccines. In this review, we highlight important principles of cancer immunity and cancer vaccines, we discuss critical features of genetic manipulation of tumor cells, and particularly focus on preclinical studies on gene therapy vaccines in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","['Dunussi-Joannopoulos, K.']",['Dunussi-Joannopoulos K'],"['Genetics Institute, One Burtt Road, Andover MA, 01810 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['I458L009001 [pii]', '10.1080/10245332.2000.11746493 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2000;5(2):103-115. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2000.11746493.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MMPs participate in many physiological processes and have also been implicated in various pathological conditions including tumor invasion and metastasis. The functions of MMPs are known to be controlled by mechanisms leading to activation of their latent forms and through inhibition of both active and latent forms by natural tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The complex relationships between MMPs and TIMPs within the bone marrow microenvironment during normal hematopoiesis as well as during leukemic growth and dissemination have not been extensively investigated. We reported that primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts and leukemic KG-1 cells penetrate reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) in an in vitro invasion assay, secrete the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and express active MMP-2 on the cell surface. We also analyzed MMP/TIMP expression in normal bone marrow cells of the myeloid and stromal lineages and showed that MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are produced in the bone marrow microenvironment. Furthermore, we examined the role of gelatinases in the transmigration of stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow into peripheral blood. We found that steady-state bone marrow CD34(+) cells, unlike circulating peripheral blood CD34(+) cells, did not express MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA transcripts and proteins, and that various cytokines were able to upregulate expression of these MMPs in bone marrow CD34(+) cells and trans-Matrigel migration of these cells. Thus, we now have evidence that MMPs and TIMPs are constituents of the hematopoietic microenvironment although their roles in hematopoiesis have yet to be determined.","['Janowska-Wieczorek, ANNA', 'Matsuzaki, AKINOBU', 'A Marquez, LEAH']","['Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Matsuzaki A', 'A Marquez L']","['Division of Clinical Hematology, Dept. of Medicine, University of Alberta and Canadian Blood Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:00,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['I458L991058 [pii]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2000;4(6):515-527.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the contribution of diminished deformability and increased fragility to these in vivo phenomena, iron status was correlated with the corresponding in vitro measurements using ektacytometry on whole erythrocytes or resealed ghost membranes. Compared to normal controls (Group 1: n = 15), those with iron deficiency of unknown origin (Group 2: n = 15), or when associated with primary proliferative polycythemia (Group 3: n = 20), were significantly less deformable and more fragile, whereas the latter category of patients, who were not anaemic (Group 4: n = 33), occupied an intermediate position. These observations support the contention that shortened intramedullary and extramedullary lifespan is contributed to by the altered physical characteristics of the red cell membrane. This observation is therapeutically important since the lesion can be readily corrected by oral iron supplementation which, at the same time, reverses the symptoms of the anaemia and prevents the development of paradoxical hyperviscosity. Additionally, it is speculated that the risk of thrombotic events in the polycythemic group may be reduced, since these appear to occur more frequently in the face of depleted body iron stores.","['Anderson, CHERYL', 'Aronson, INGRID', 'Jacobs, PETER']","['Anderson C', 'Aronson I', 'Jacobs P']","['The Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology, University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, Cape Town, 8000, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:00,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['I458L991047 [pii]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2000;4(5):457-460.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It typically affects males, causes marked splenomegaly and moderate enlargement of the liver, whilst lymphadenopathy is inconspicuous. Pancytopenia is characteristic with unusually profound monocytopenia, variable reduction in platelets, and the presence in the peripheral blood and marrow of abnormal small lymphocytes having irregular cytoplasmic margins. Ultrastructure, combined with cytochemistry and flow cytometry, have refined diagnosis. A variant exists between this classical entity and B prolymphocytic leukaemia, where blastic transformation or massive lymph node enlargement are found, and this is of ominous significance. In all these patients with this entity conventional chemotherapy is ineffective and shortens survival. Our previous experience with splenectomy results in excellent clinical control for long periods of time, but without disease eradication. There followed a vogue for the use of interferon but this is limited by high cost and dose-dependent side-effects. Contemporary management centres on the purine analogues, where durable responses are possible with fludarabine and deoxycoformycin, but best with 2'chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA). To document the efficacy of the latter agent, we analysed the outcome in seventeen consecutive patients treated over the last five years. Four were ineligible for analysis, although two had 2-CDA. The other thirteen, managed on a standard seven-day course of 0.1 mg/kg 2-CDA given as a continuous intravenous infusion, all responded promptly. Apart from transient leucopenia complications have been minimal, and oral co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii was maintained during the first one year. In all thirteen there was a rapid return to normal of peripheral blood count and marrow on aspiration and trephine biopsy. Even in the longest follow-up clinical and haematologic remission has been maintained and no patients have required retreatment. One individual has relapsed in the marrow at two years. Despite the relative expense of the agent the excellent treatment outcome and patient acceptability, coupled with its safety, leads to the recommendation that in South Africa - as elsewhere in the world - this be regarded as the first line of treatment.","['Jacobs, PETER', 'Wood, LUCILLE', 'Mansvelt, ERNA P.

Characteristics include splenomegaly, pancytopenia, a usually indolent course, and responsiveness to both interferon and purine analog therapy. Accurate diagnosis requires the demonstration of malignant cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood which contain cytoplasmic projections and characteristic surface antigens. Splenectomy was identified early as a palliative therapy, and in 1984 systemic treatment with interferon alpha was first reported to induce complete remissions. Soon thereafter, the purine analog deoxycoformycin was found to induce more durable complete remissions in a higher percentage of patients. In 1990, 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine, a new purine analog therapy, was reported to be capable of inducing long-term durable responses in most patients after a single cycle. Current challenges include identifying which purine analog is the least toxic since both appear similarly effective, and neither appear to add to the already increased rate of second malignancies occurring in these patients. Moreover, up to 25% of patients with hairy cell leukemia fail initially or eventually to respond to standard therapy, making the development of new approaches necessary. The characteristic bright expression of several B-cell antigens on the malignant cells, including CD20, CD22 and CD25, has led to the development of targeted biotherapeutic approaches. A recombinant immunotoxin targeting CD25 has recently been reported to induce major responses and it is likely that other successful targeted approaches will be reported early in the new century.","['Kreitman, ROBERT J.', 'Cheson, BRUCE D.']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Cheson BD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Cancer Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['I458L991038 [pii]', '10.1080/10245332.1999.11746452 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 1999;4(4):283-303. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1999.11746452.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine a relationship between telomeric erosion and response to treatment, we measured telomere length following treatment in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. We used 70 samples of bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained from 26 patients with CML in the chronic phase subsequently. Telomere length was determined by a Southern hybridization of HinfI-digested DNA using a (TTAGGG)(4) probe, and the terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length was measured. Telomerase activity was also measured in 14 CML patients at the time of diagnosis using a telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Of the 26 patients with CML at the time of diagnosis, 14 had normal TRF lengths and the remaining 12 had shortened TRFs compared to those of age-matched normal individuals. In a group of CML patients treated with interferon alpha (IFNalpha), 80% of those who showed normal TRFs obtained cytogenetic responses. Approximately 50% of patients with shortened TRFs and treated with IFNalpha showed normalization of TRFs after IFNalpha treatment and all of them were cytogenetic responders. None of the CML patients with shortened TRFs before and after IFNalpha treatment achieved major cytogenetic response and they had high levels of telomerase activity. In the group of CML patients treated with hydroxyurea alone, although some patients showed normalization of TRF lengths after treatment, none of them showed major cytogenetic response. Telomere length before treatment may be related to CML disease severity. Cytogenetic response could be expected in CML patients with normal TRF lengths and treated with IFNalpha. Thus, measurement of telomere length after treatment might provide important information in managing CML patients.","['Hayashi, SHIGEFUMI', 'Iwama, HIROSHI', 'Yahata, NAOYUKI', 'Ando, KEIKO', 'Ohyashiki, JUNKO H.', 'Ohyashiki, KAZUMA']","['Hayashi S', 'Iwama H', 'Yahata N', 'Ando K', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,2001/06/16 10:00,2001/06/16 10:01,['2001/06/16 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['I458L991007 [pii]', '10.1080/10245332.1999.11746425 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 1999;4(1):1-10. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1999.11746425.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Stimulation of THP-1 cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to prompt their differentiation into macrophage-like cells and evaluation of the possible induction of ER. METHODS: The expression of ER was analyzed by immunocytochemical assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: After stimulation by PMA, the human myeloid monocytic THP-1 cells showed the presence of ER, together with markers of monocytic cell differentiation such as CD68, CD54 and HLA-DR. CONCLUSION: Estrogen effects may be exerted directly through ER on monocytes/macrophages.

Firstly, serum levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF and Flt3-ligand (Flt3L) were examined in acute leukemia patients with treatment-induced cytopenia and complicating bacterial infections. Increased serum levels of both G-CSF and Flt3-ligand (Flt3L) were detected when these patients developed therapy-induced leukopenia, whereas GM-CSF levels were low or undetectable. Development of complicating bacterial infections then increased the serum levels of both G- and GM-CSF, and the Flt3L levels remained high during the infections. Secondly, release of growth factors was characterized for clonogenic T cells that remained in the circulation of acute leukemia patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from these patients released high levels of GM-CSF, relatively low levels of IL-3 secretion having been detected, and only a minority of the clones released detectable amounts of Flt3L. Thus, circulating T cells may contribute to the high systemic growth factor levels in cytopenic patients. Thirdly, plasma levels of GM-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3) were examined in patients with malignant disorders who received chemotherapy plus G-CSF for stem cell mobilization. Increased levels of GM-CSF and Flt3L were detected both in the patients' plasma and in the stem cell grafts. Despite the increased growth factor levels in neutropenic patients with complicating infections, the occurrence of febrile neutropenia did not have a major impact on normal hematopoietic reconstitution (i.e. duration of treatment-induced neutropenia) after intensive chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Bruserud, O', 'Foss, B', 'Petersen, H']","['Bruserud O', 'Foss B', 'Petersen H']","['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2001/06/12 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/12 10:00'],"['2001/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2001 Apr-Jun;12(2):231-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene inactivation studies have shown that both SDF-1 alpha and CXCR-4 are essential for B lymphopoiesis. Migration of leukemic cells may also be dependent on SDF-1 alpha and CXCR-4. Fibronectin (FN) is a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and one of the natural supports for cell movement in their bone hematopoietic environment. In the present study, we examined the influence of FN on the chemotactic effect of SDF-1 alpha and on the CXCR-4 expression and function on human precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) cells at sequential stages of development. Fourteen children with pre-B ALL were studied. Their immunophenotypes belonged to the first three stages of B cell differentiation. Despite relatively high levels of CXCR-4 expression at all stages, the responsiveness to SDF-1 alpha, measured as the percentage of migrating cells in the transwell culture system, varied with patients and seems to be less significant for pre-B3 (and pre-B1) than for pre-B2. There was no correlation (r = 0.2) between the SDF-1 alpha induced migration (range: 2.5-39%) and the cell surface density of CXCR-4 (range: 46.5-97.5%). The extracellular matrix protein FN, either coated on the filter (for more than 18 hours) or in soluble form, enhanced the SDF-1 alpha induced migration of pre-B ALL respectively (2 fold and 1.6 fold) without influencing CXCR-4 expression in short term cultures. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of the FN receptors, VLA-4 (CD49d) and VLA-5 (CD49e), by direct immunofluorescence, on these leukemic cells. VLA-4 was strongly expressed in all stages of pre-B ALL (range: 77-97%) while VLA-5 expression was more variable (range: 14-94%), but no correlation with the FN-dependent increased SDF-1 alpha chemotactic effect was noted. In conclusion, the migratory behavior of pre-B leukemic cells in response to SDF-1 alpha partly depends upon the stage of differentiation, and partly upon unexplained patient variability. Our results suggest that several molecules from the extracellular matrix, such as FN, may be implicated in this phenomenon.","['Sbaa-Ketata, E', 'Vasse, M', 'Lenormand, B', 'Schneider, P', 'Soria, C', 'Vannier, J P']","['Sbaa-Ketata E', 'Vasse M', 'Lenormand B', 'Schneider P', 'Soria C', 'Vannier JP']","['Groupe MERCI, Faculte de Medecine-Pharmacie, 22, boulevard Gambetta, 76183 Rouen Cedex, France. elhem.ketata@free.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis/*physiology', 'Child', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/12 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/12 10:00'],"['2001/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2001 Apr-Jun;12(2):223-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 52 adult patients, diagnosed with acute (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) admitted for allogeneic BMT to a university hospital BMT unit in preparation for a transplantation of genotypically matched HLA donor marrow, were interviewed immediately after informed consent and prior to preparatory treatment for transplantation. Semistructured interviews were conducted and recorded for analysis to assess coping styles and were evaluated by a new content analytic coping measure [Ulm Coping Manual (UCM)]. Patients were a random sample of all eligible patients on the BMT unit between May 1990 and May 1994. RESULTS: Complete audiotaped interviews were rated by blind raters, employing a newly developed content analysis for the identification of patients' coping strategies. Multivariate analysis using a Cox model revealed three pretransplant variables that demonstrated a statistically significant influence on 5-year survival: Stage of Disease at transplant (P < .012), Distraction (P < .007), and Fighting Spirit as coping modalities (P < .013). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this prospective study document the impact of certain psychological variables, notably coping style on survival with BMT. This suggests the necessity of utilizing psychosocial interventions to address stress and anxiety in patients awaiting transplantation in order to reduce anxieties and to employ more effective coping techniques to deal more appropriately with their situation and to enhance Fighting Spirit.

This report describes the data of 54 patients with newly diagnosed M6 AML, consecutively seen in our hospital between May 1976 and May 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 40 males and 14 females. Median age was 59 years. Pancytopenia was the most common feature at diagnosis. Twenty-six percent of cases presented with secondary AML. Karyotype was successfully performed in 35 cases. Eleven patients presented with normal karyotype, nine with simple karyotypic abnormalities, and fifteen with major karyotypic abnormalities. Fifty of the fifty-four patients received one or two courses of induction chemotherapy combining anthracyclines with cytarabine according to different successive protocols. One elderly patient only received low-dose cytarabine, and three patients died before any chemotherapy could be given. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 29 cases (54%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 40%-67%). As post-remission therapy, four patients could be allografted, and two underwent autologous transplantation. All other treated patients received continuation chemotherapy. Twenty-one patients have relapsed (72%). Median time to relapse was six months. Among those patients, only eight achieved a second CR (38%). The median disease-free survival (DFS) was eight months (95% CI: 4-10 months) with a five-year survival rate of 17%. Median overall survival (OS) was nine months (95% CI: 5-12 months) with a five-year survival rate of 13%. In univariate analysis, poor prognostic factors for DFS were secondary AML (P = 0.05) and initial platelet count <50 x 109/l (P = 0.02). Poor prognostic factors for OS were age > or = 60 years (P = 0.005), secondary AML (P = 0.05), initial 'blastic' fever (P = 0.0004), and initial haemoglobin level < 90 g/l (P = 0.03). All factors, but haemoglobin level, remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Although it was not statistically significant, there was a trent for a better prognosis of M6 patients presenting with normal karyotype as compared to those displaying chromosomal abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis points to a somewhat heterogenous group of AML in terms of clinical and biological features, and outcome. Distinctive subgroups can be identified according to prognostic factors related to survival. A larger multicenter study with well-defined diagnostic criteria is warranted to further clarify treatment effects.","['Colita, A', 'Belhabri, A', 'Chelghoum, Y', 'Charrin, C', 'Fiere, D', 'Thomas, X']","['Colita A', 'Belhabri A', 'Chelghoum Y', 'Charrin C', 'Fiere D', 'Thomas X']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hjpital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/12 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/06/12 10:00'],"['2001/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1011133115435 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)54071-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2001 Apr;12(4):451-5. doi: 10.1023/a:1011133115435.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review article, the early development, the molecular and clinical pathogenesis of both the ts1 mutant of the Moloney murine leukemia virus and LP-BM5 are examined. Based on an extensive evaluation of the literature on LP-BM5 and ts1, it is concluded that the ts1 virus may serve as a better animal model to human retrovirus infection.","['Clark, S', 'Duggan, J', 'Chakraborty, J']","['Clark S', 'Duggan J', 'Chakraborty J']","['Department of Physiology and Molecular Medicine, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo 43614-5804, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'HIV Infections/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/etiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology']",2001/06/12 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/06/12 10:00'],"['2001/06/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/088282401750234475 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 2001;14(2):95-109. doi: 10.1089/088282401750234475.,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite improvements in supportive care, pulmonary complications remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We report on a patient who received a double lung transplantation (LTX) for therapy-refractory bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) associated with extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic BMT. RESULTS: At present, 38 months after BMT and 23 months after LTX, the patient is in complete hematological and cytogenetic remission and without signs of respiratory distress. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that lung transplantation could be a therapeutic option in selected patients with BO after allogeneic BMT that is associated with extensive chronic GVHD and who are refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy.","['Rabitsch, W', 'Deviatko, E', 'Keil, F', 'Herold, C', 'Dekan, G', 'Greinix, H T', 'Lechner, K', 'Klepetko, W', 'Kalhs, P']","['Rabitsch W', 'Deviatko E', 'Keil F', 'Herold C', 'Dekan G', 'Greinix HT', 'Lechner K', 'Klepetko W', 'Kalhs P']","['Department of Radiology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', '*Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/09 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200105150-00028 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2001 May 15;71(9):1341-3. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200105150-00028.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to test whether children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experience premature AR. This might, in part, explain their tendency to develop obesity. Timing of AR was assessed by visual inspection of body mass index plots in 68 patients treated for ALL in first remission. This sample comprised all eligible patients treated in Scotland between 1991 and 1998, age 30 months or less at the time of diagnosis. Timing of AR in patients was compared against a cohort of 889 healthy British children studied during the 1990s using the same method. AR occurred significantly earlier in the patients treated for ALL (chi(2) test, P < 0.001). The AR had occurred in 43% (29 of 68) of the patients and 4% (40 of 889) of the comparison group by age 37 months. At 49 months AR had occurred in 81% (55 of 68) of the patients and 21% (190 of 889) of the comparison group. Treatment of ALL is associated with a significantly advanced AR. This might, in part, explain the extremely high prevalence of obesity in long-term survivors.

By using HPLC, N-acetylation of 2-aminofluorene was determined. Luteolin displayed a dose-dependent inhibition to cytosolic NAT activity and intact human and mice leukemia cells. Time-course experiments showed that N-acetylation of 2-aminofluorene measured from intact human and mice leukemia cells were inhibited by luteolin for up to 24 hours. Using standard steady-state kinetic analysis, it was demonstrated that luteolin was a possible uncompetitive inhibitor to NAT activity in cytosols. The DNA-2-aminofluorene adduct formation in human and mouse leukemia cells were inhibited by luteolin.

Eighty-nine patients (33%) received only palliative treatment, while 174 patients (67%) were treated with different intensive chemotherapy regimens. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) for the whole series was 7.7+/-1.2 and 4.3+/-1.6%, respectively. For patients receiving chemotherapy, OS was 10.5+/-2.5 and 7+/-2.6%, while for those patients receiving supportive treatment it was 1.1+/-1.1 and 0%, respectively (P=0.002). Within the group of patients receiving chemotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rate was 46%; treatment failure rate was 54% (36% due to treatment-related mortality and 18% due to resistant disease). Variables influencing CR rate were FAB subtype, CD7 positivity, chemotherapy regimen, creatinine level, hepatomegaly, and period of diagnosis. Median disease-free survival (DFS) duration was 8.4 months with a probability of being disease-free at 10 years of 10+/-5%. There were no significant differences in DFS according to age. According to the period of diagnosis (1979-1986 vs. 1987-1998), improvements in the CR rate (27 vs. 56%, P=0.0002), and OS (10.9 vs. 15.7 months, P=0.0007) were observed.

The utility of classifications for research on etiology of these diseases has not guided their development in the past. The classification of leukemias and lymphomas has undergone dramatic changes with increasing understanding of the development of the normal immune cells. Historically, the first entity to be recognised was Hodgkin disease. Other malignancies of the lymphatic system were then called 'Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas' (NHL), a distinction that remains valid even today. Cancers that tend not to form distinct masses but usually present with a raised white blood cell count were called leukemias. As knowledge has improved, however, the early juxtaposition of leukemias versus lymphomas has lost relevance, since often the same entity can present in either way. With better understanding the terms 'lymphosarcoma' and 'reticulosarcoma', which were earlier widely applied have been replaced by more precise terminology. Different classifications have been put forward over the years. The 'Revised European and American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms' and the derived WHO classification are structured to mirror normal B/T-cell differentiation. In these modern classifications, distinct disease entities are defined based on the combination of morphology, immunological and molecular techniques and clinical features. The proposed major groups of lymphoid neoplasms are B-cell lymphomas/leukemias, T/Natural Killer-cell lymphomas/leukemias and Hodgkin disease. About 20 entities are recognised. This provides for the first time a truly international view of lymphomas and leukemias. It has emerged that such a classification can be used successfully by expert hematopathologists and yields highly reproducible results. It is also clear that no single marker, be it morphology, genetic analysis or immunophenotyping can be used as the 'gold standard' for diagnosis but that a combination of techniques is needed.","['Ottensmeier, C']",['Ottensmeier C'],"['Cancer Sciences Division, Southampton University, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK. cho@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,,IM,"['Hodgkin Disease/classification', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia/*classification', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification', 'Lymphoma/*classification', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification', 'World Health Organization']",2001/06/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279701002010 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00201-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2001 Jun 1;135-136:653-64. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00201-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These estimates are based on the most recent human epidemiologic data developed by Drs Delzell and Macaluso and their colleagues at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The implications of Poisson regression analyses of the relative rate for leukemia are explored using their updated dose estimates and lymphohematopoietic cancer data. The Poisson regression model in these analyses has the same form as in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s draft risk assessment of 1,3-butadiene [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Health Risk Assessment of 1,3-Butadiene - External Review Draft, National Center for Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, 63 Fed. Reg. 7167 (February 12, 1998) Publication NCEA-W-0267, Washington, 1998]. Consistent with the proposed cancer risk assessment guidelines of the EPA and the EPA's draft risk assessment, the exploration includes the maximum likelihood estimate of the 'effective concentration' (EC(01)) corresponding to an extra risk of leukemia of 0.01 (1%) from a lifetime continuous exposure to 1,3-butadiene based on a linear dose-response model and the cumulative 1,3-butadiene dose metric (ppm-years). The incorporation of the most recent exposure estimates results in a 2.5-fold decrease in the estimates of leukemia risks computed by EPA. In addition, three changes proposed by the American Chemistry Council (formerly the Chemical Manufacturers Association) to the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) for EPA's draft risk assessment of 1,3-butadiene are incorporated into the calculation. This results in approximately an additional fivefold decrease in the risk estimates of leukemia.

There are a number of possible explanations for these discrepancies, including differences in disease classification and diagnosis as well as possible quantitative and qualitative differences in occupational exposure between these two industries. This led us to evaluate the possibility that the pattern of disease observed in SBR might be influenced by the presence of an important class of biologically reactive chemicals, dithiocarbamates (DTC), that were present in SBR but not BD monomer production. Therefore, we compared the immunotoxic and hematotoxic activities of DTC and BD metabolites in human immune and hematopoietic cells. Relative to the mouse, human CD34+ bone marrow cells are relatively resistant to the direct effects of BD metabolites, with only the bis-oxide producing any evidence of suppression of clonogenic response at concentrations between 1 and 10 microM. Similarly, treatment of human CD4+ lymphocytes with known (2,3-epoxybutene) and putative BD metabolites (D,L-butane-bis-oxide, (2S,3R)-3-epoxybutane-1,2-diol) does not result in appreciable T-cell toxicity at concentrations likely to be encountered in vivo. In contrast, treatment of human cells with DTC at concentrations as low as 100 nM results in significant suppression of hematopoietic clonogenic response and T-lymphocyte function. Additional studies in our laboratory and others suggest a role for copper in DTC toxicity in both human lymphocytes and bone marrow cells, although the pattern of altered transcriptional regulation observed is markedly different in these two cell populations. These results are consistent with the pattern of DTC toxicity previously observed in clinical and molecular studies.","['Irons, R D', 'Stillman, W S', 'Pyatt, D W', 'Yang, Y', 'Le, A', 'Gustafson, D L', 'Hua Zheng, J']","['Irons RD', 'Stillman WS', 'Pyatt DW', 'Yang Y', 'Le A', 'Gustafson DL', 'Hua Zheng J']","['University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 4200 East 9th Avenue, C238, Denver, CO 80262, USA. richard.irons@uchsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Elastomers)', '0 (Styrenes)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '61789-96-6 (styrene-butadiene rubber)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Butadienes/chemical synthesis/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Chemical Industry', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Elastomers', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Mice', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced', 'Risk Assessment', 'Styrenes/chemical synthesis', 'Thiocarbamates/*toxicity']",2001/06/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279701002162 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00216-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2001 Jun 1;135-136:615-25. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00216-2.,,,,"['2 P30 CA 46934-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES06258/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

BD is carcinogenic in rats and mice, however, there are striking species differences in cancer potency and spectrum of tumors, with mice being more susceptible to tumor induction than rats. Epidemiology studies suggest an excess incidence of leukemia in workers in the styrene-butadiene rubber industry. Consideration of mechanisms of BD carcinogenicity can provide insights into differences in cancer potency between rodents and serve to elucidate the extent to which BD exposure may cause cancer in humans. Mechanistic research in the areas of biochemical toxicology, molecular biology, molecular dosimetry, and susceptibility factors can impact BD cancer risk assessment for humans. This research has focused on quantitating species differences in the metabolism of BD and BD epoxides, defining molecular lesions produced by BD epoxides, identifying biomarkers for BD exposure to explore metabolic pathways in humans, and determining potential risk factors for sensitive subpopulations. BD is activated by P450 isozymes, including CYP2E1, to at least two genotoxic metabolites, epoxybutene (EB) and diepoxybutane (DEB). Dosimetry data from several laboratories on EB and DEB following inhalation exposure to BD indicate that blood concentrations of EB were four-eight-fold higher in mice compared with rats and that blood concentrations of DEB were 25-100-fold higher in mice than in rats. The higher levels of these two DNA-reactive metabolites in mice compared with rats probably contribute to the species differences in carcinogenic effects of BD between mice and rats. In vitro metabolism studies of BD in rats, mice, and human tissues indicate that there are significant quantitative species differences in the metabolic activation of BD to EB and DEB and the detoxication of EB and DEB. Activation/detoxication ratios calculated using in vitro kinetic constants reveal that ratios in mice were greater than in both rats and humans. In vitro data are consistent with in vivo dosimetry data and cancer potency for rodents, and suggest that humans may be at a decreased risk. Data on mutagenicity and mutational spectra of BD epoxides show mechanistic differences between EB- and DEB-induced mutational events suggesting involvement of DEB in the development of cancer. Concentrations of DEB that are genotoxic in vitro are within the range of concentrations measured in mice in vivo, whereas concentrations of EB that are genotoxic in vitro are ten-100-fold greater than concentrations observed in vivo. Characterization of molecular events indicate that EB-induced genotoxicity is due to point mutations and small deletions, while DEB induces point mutations, small deletions, and large-scale deletions involving many base pairs. The extent to which epoxybutanediol is involved in BD carcinogenesis is not known. Molecular dosimetry studies in rodents and humans have focused on urinary metabolites and DNA and hemoglobin adducts. Data from these studies are consistent with in vivo and in vitro metabolism data providing further support for the differences in metabolic activation and deactivation of BD and BD epoxides across species and the role of DEB in tumor development. Research on potential susceptibility factors points to other P450 isozymes, in addition to CYP2E1, that are involved in both the metabolic activation and mutagenicity of BD. Taken together, mechanistic data on BD toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics provide an integrated insight into critical steps in initiation of cancer, metabolites responsible for cancer, sensitive biomarkers for exposure, and potential risk factors for individual susceptibility. Available evidence suggests that BD is unlikely to be a human carcinogen at the low exposure concentrations currently encountered in the environment or workplace.","['Bond, J A', 'Medinsky, M A']","['Bond JA', 'Medinsky MA']","[""ToxCon, 5505 Frenchman's Creek Dr., Durham, NC 27713, USA. toxcon@ntrnet.net""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Butadienes/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity']",2001/06/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279701001995 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00199-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2001 Jun 1;135-136:599-614. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00199-5.,,,,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,

A detailed review of the SBR manufacturing process indicates that sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDTC) introduced into the SBR manufacturing process for a period in the 1950s coincides with increased leukemia mortality. Using the Computer-Optimized Molecular Parametric Analysis of Chemical Toxicity (COMPACT), we assessed the enzyme (cytochrome P450) substrate specificity of an olefin series including 1,3-butadiene (BD) and also modeled its interaction with DMDTC. These analyses showed correlation of a structural/electronic parameter--the COMPACT radius--with the presence or absence of cytogenetic activity and also found that DMDTC would inhibit the oxidative metabolism of BD at least at high concentrations. Both DMDTC and its diethyl analog (DEDTC) bind with CYP 2E1 and CYP 2A6. Both of these isoforms are important in the initial oxidative metabolism of butadiene and other olefins. In co-exposure studies in mice of DMDTC with BD or with epoxybutene (EB), we found that there was a reduced increase in genotoxic activity based on micronuclei induction compared with BD or EB exposure alone. Treatment with DMDTC significantly increased the protein carbonyl contents of hepatic microsomes compared with that of controls, a finding that may be related to DMDTC's activity as a prooxidant. Co-exposure with DMDTC and EB increased hepatic microsomal carbonyls to levels significantly greater than those of DMDTC-treated mice, while EB administration in the absence of DMDTC did not change protein carbonyls relative to those of controls. The increase in hepatic microsomal protein carbonyls suggests that DMDTC may modulate EB metabolism towards the formation of reactive intermediates that react with proteins. The present molecular modeling and mechanistic studies suggest that co-exposure of BD and DMDTC is a plausible biological hypothesis regarding increased leukemia risk among SBR workers.","['Bird, M G', 'Lewis, D F', 'Whitman, F T', 'Lewis, R J', 'Przygoda, R T', 'Witz, G']","['Bird MG', 'Lewis DF', 'Whitman FT', 'Lewis RJ', 'Przygoda RT', 'Witz G']","['ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Inc., Annandale, NJ, USA. bird@iarc.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Dimethyldithiocarbamate)', '0 (Elastomers)', '0 (Styrenes)', '61789-96-6 (styrene-butadiene rubber)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Alkenes/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Butadienes/chemical synthesis/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/metabolism', 'Dimethyldithiocarbamate/metabolism/toxicity', 'Elastomers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Models, Biological', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Styrenes/chemical synthesis']",2001/06/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279701002150 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00215-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2001 Jun 1;135-136:571-84. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00215-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second part is an examination of the morbidity experience of cohort members who were still working during 1992-1998, including 289 of the 614 mortality cohort members. The third part is an evaluation of the hematological results from routine health surveillance and/or medical examinations. Approximately 430 of the 614 employees who had complete blood count (CBC) data as of December 1999 were included in the hematological evaluations. The most recent examination containing CBC data was used and compared with similar data for over 2600 other employees from this facility. Overall mortality during the follow-up period, 1948-1998, was significantly lower than for the local comparison population (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 0.55 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.42-0.70). Mortality for all cancer was also significantly lower (SMR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-0.92). Mortality for all lymphohematopoietic cancer was about the same as the comparison population (SMR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.22-3.11). None of the cause-specific morbidity was in excess compared with an internal comparison group. There were no differences in the distribution or mean values of hematological variables (e.g. white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, mean corpuscular volume) between the butadiene cohort and the comparison group, or between a subgroup of workers in jobs with the highest potential for butadiene exposure (i.e. shipping) and the rest of the butadiene cohort.

Earlier analyses of mortality for this cohort found statistically significant deficits for the 'all causes of death' category, and a lower than expected mortality for most leading causes of death. Past analyses also showed a significant elevation for deaths from cancers of the lymphohematopoietic system that was mainly due to an increase in deaths from lymphosarcoma. The purpose of this update was to examine the patterns of mortality through the end of 1999, for five additional years of follow-up. Persons who had become eligible between the last cohort update and April 1996 were added. Cohort membership was closed after April 1996 due to the sale of the facility. A total of 1422 deaths through December 1999 were identified, giving over 200 more deaths than in the last report on this aging cohort. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes of death was 89 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) =84-94], which is statistically significantly low, and that for all malignant neoplasms was 90 (95% CI=81-101).

One is a study of incidence and mortality among 2314 production workers employed in the CP production plant in Yerevan, Armenia, between 1940 and 1988. The cohort was followed up for cancer incidence for the years 1979-1990 and for cancer mortality for 1979-1988. The second study is a mortality study among 5185 shoe manufacturing workers in Moscow who used polychloroprene latex and glue. Shoe workers were employed between 1940 and 1976, and followed from 1979 through 1993. The standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated using the Armenian and Moscow population as reference. An internal comparison analysis based on Poisson regression modeling was conducted. In the Yerenan cohort, incidence and mortality from all cancers were below expectation, but increased incidence (SIR, 3.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-7.27), and mortality (SMR, 3.39; CI, 1.09-10.5) from liver cancer were noted. A dose-response relationship was suggested between the risk of liver cancer and indices of CP exposure. For the entire Moscow cohort, all-cause mortality was close to expectation and all-cancer mortality was increased. There was an increase in the mortality from liver cancer (SMR, 2.4; CI, 1.1-4.3), kidney cancer (SMR, 1.8; CI, 0.9-3.4), and leukemia (SMR, 1.9; CI, 1.0-3.3). Mortality from liver cancer and leukemia was associated with various indicators of CP exposure. A similar, although less consistent, pattern was found for kidney cancer. The association between CP exposure and risk of leukemia may be due to concomitant exposure to benzene. The results for liver cancer point towards a carcinogenic effect of CP.","['Zaridze, D', 'Bulbulyan, M', 'Changuina, O', 'Margaryan, A', 'Boffetta, P']","['Zaridze D', 'Bulbulyan M', 'Changuina O', 'Margaryan A', 'Boffetta P']","['Institute of Carcinogenesis, RAMS Cancer Research Center, Kashirskoe shosse 24, Moscow 115478, Russia. dgzaridze@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '126-99-8 (Chloroprene)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Chloroprene/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Russia/epidemiology']",2001/06/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279701001843 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00184-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2001 Jun 1;135-136:487-503. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00184-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because past occupational exposures have been associated with an increased risk of leukemia, there has been a dramatic reduction in workplace exposure standards. The health benefits of these reduced levels of occupational exposure to BD will be difficult to evaluate using relatively insensitive traditional epidemiological studies; however, biomarkers can be used to determine whether there are genotoxic effects associated with recent exposures to BD. In past studies of BD-exposed workers in Southeast Texas, we observed an increase in the frequency of lymphocytes with mutations in a reporter gene, hprt. Frequencies of hprt mutant cells correlated with air levels of BD and with the concentration of a BD metabolite in urine. Average exposures to 1-3 parts per million (p.p.m.) of BD were associated with a threefold increase in hprt variant (mutant) frequencies (Vfs). We now report results from a follow-up study of workers in a synthetic rubber plant in Southeast Texas. Thirty-seven workers were evaluated on three occasions over a 2-week period for exposure to BD by the use of personal organic vapor monitors and by determining the concentration of a BD metabolite in urine. The frequency of hprt mutants was determined, by autoradiography, with lymphocyte samples collected 2 weeks after the final exposure measurement. Based on their work locations, the study participants were assigned to high-exposure (N=22) or low-exposure (N=15) groups. The BD exposure, +/-standard error, of the workers in the high-exposure group (1.65+/-0.52 p.p.m.) was significantly greater than the low-exposure group (0.07+/-0.03 p.p.m.; P<0.01). The frequency of hprt mutant lymphocytes was also significantly different in the two groups (high, 10.67+/-1.5 x 10(-6); low, 3.54+/-0.6 x 10(-6); P<0.001). The concentration of the urine metabolite was greater in the high-exposure group, but the difference was not significant. The correlation coefficient between hprt Vf and BD exposure levels was r=0.44 (CI(95), 0.11-0.69; P=0.011). This study reproduced the findings from a previous study at this plant. Although studies of butadiene-exposed workers in other countries have not detected an effect of exposure on frequencies of hprt mutant lymphocytes, we have repeatedly observed this result in our studies in Texas.","['Ward, J B Jr', 'Abdel-Rahman, S Z', 'Henderson, R F', 'Stock, T H', 'Morandi, M', 'Rosenblatt, J I', 'Ammenheuser, M M']","['Ward JB Jr', 'Abdel-Rahman SZ', 'Henderson RF', 'Stock TH', 'Morandi M', 'Rosenblatt JI', 'Ammenheuser MM']","['Division of Environmental Toxicology, Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, 2.102 Ewing Hall, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1110, USA. jward@utmb.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Mutagens)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/analysis/toxicity', 'Biomarkers', 'Butadienes/analysis/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/toxicity', '*Mutation', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Rubber/*chemical synthesis', 'Texas']",2001/06/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279701001831 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00183-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2001 Jun 1;135-136:465-83. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00183-1.,,,,"['M01RR00073/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES06676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES06015/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most recent studies of these populations are characterized by carefully enumerated study populations, extremely long and high quality mortality follow-up, accurate job categorizations, detailed exposure assessments, and comprehensive statistical analyses. Leukemia was clearly associated with increasing estimated butadiene exposure in the SBR study, but not in the monomer industry study. This has lead to hypotheses about exposure differences between these two industries and the presence of co-factors or confounders in the SBR industry. Research presented at this symposium should shed some light on these hypotheses. The chloroprene epidemiologic literature, on the other hand, is in an early stage of development. The existing studies are limited by poor exposure characterization, lack of control of potential confounding factors, incompleteness in cohort enumeration, short follow-up periods, and small numbers of cancer cases.

Summaries are available on-line at http://monographs.iarc.fr. 1,3-Butadiene is currently classified in Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans), on the basis of limited evidence for increased occupational cancer risk in humans plus sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity at multiple organ sites in rats and especially in mice exposed by inhalation. Four epidemiologic studies are available on cancer risk among workers exposed to 1,3-butadiene, one large study among styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) workers, and one large and two small studies among 1,3-butadiene production workers. The results of the study of SBR workers suggest an association between butadiene exposure and leukaemia risk, which is consistent with the results of the large study of production workers. This latter study also suggested an increased risk of lymphoreticulosarcoma (ICD-8, 200). The major factors hampering the assessment of the available results are (i) possible misclassification of lymphoid and haematopoietic neoplasms, (ii) limitations in the assessment of past exposure (with the exception of the study of SBR workers) and (iii) a potential confounding effect of agents other than butadiene. Future research priorities include (i) the incorporation of newly developed biomarkers of exposure, (ii) the possible application of intermediate biomarkers, (iii) the replication of the study among SBR workers, possibly in Europe, and (iv) reanalysis of existing data in light of revisions of the classifications of leukaemias and lymphomas in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (2000). Isoprene is classified in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans), on the basis of sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity at multiple organ sites in both mice and rats, especially male mice, exposed by inhalation. No epidemiologic studies are available on cancer risk from occupational exposure to isoprene. Such studies could be conducted within the framework of existing or future studies of SBR workers, assuming that isoprene exposure can be disentangled from butadiene and styrene exposure. Chloroprene is classified in Group 2B on the basis of sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity at multiple organ sites in both mice and rats exposed by inhalation. Studies of chloroprene exposed workers now include chemical workers from the United States, China and Armenia as well as shoe workers from Russia. The results of the studies from China, Armenia and Russia suggest an excess risk of liver cancer. The risk of other neoplasms was not consistently increased. Limitations of available studies include possible bias from cohort enumeration, follow-up, and choice of reference population. In most studies the exposure assessment was poor, the possible confounding effect of co-exposures was not addressed and the statistical power was low. The pathology of the cases of liver cancer should be reviewed. Future research priorities include a replication of available studies in well-defined populations and the development of biomarkers of exposure.","['Rice, J M', 'Boffetta, P']","['Rice JM', 'Boffetta P']","['IARC Monographs Programme, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 69372 Lyon, Cedex 08, France. rice@iarc.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Hemiterpenes)', '0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Pentanes)', '0A62964IBU (isoprene)', '126-99-8 (Chloroprene)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butadienes/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Chloroprene/*toxicity', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epoxy Compounds/toxicity', '*Hemiterpenes', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Pentanes', 'Rats', 'Rubber']",2001/06/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/06/09 10:00'],"['2001/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279701001752 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00175-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2001 Jun 1;135-136:11-26. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(01)00175-2.,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical staining for FeLV glycoprotein 70 (gp70) was performed on all six formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors using an avidin-biotin complex technique.

CD79a and CD79b expression precedes immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain gene rearrangement and CD20 expression during B-cell ontogeny and disappears later than CD20 in the late (plasma cell) stage of B-cell differentiation. Therefore, antibodies to CD79a and CD79b are useful in the differential diagnosis of B-cell neoplasms from T-cell neoplasms or myeloid neoplasms, or L and H lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's lymphoma from classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. In addition, CD79a and CD79b antibodies are useful markers in the diagnosis of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL) because many of these tumors are negative for other B-cell markers, such as CD20 and CD45RA. Furthermore, for B-cell neoplasms, wherein CD20 expression is aberrantly lost, such as in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or for B-cell neoplasms after CD20-antibody therapy, CD79a may be used as a first-line B-cell marker for the diagnosis.

Germinal center FDCs in lymphoid hyperplasias and expanded FDC meshworks in the 8 mantle cell lymphomas, 7 low-grade MALT lymphomas, and 6 low-grade follicular lymphomas were intensely stained with all these markers. In 6 cases of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, tumor cells were CD23+. In four cases of nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease (HD), expanded FDC meshwork's sharply delineating negative tumor cells and their rosetting T cell, were revealed mainly with the CD21 and CD35 antibodies.

The line, named WEHI-3B/CPX, expresses a specific resistance to ciprofloxacin (CPX; resistance index=17.3+/-2.2), and does not show cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones, camptothecin and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, etoposide and teniposide. Although a little decrease in intracellular accumulation of CPX is observed in WEHI-3B/CPX cells, these cells do not express MDR or LRP markers, and the resistance is not circumvented by verapamil. Purified nuclear extracts from WEHI-3B and WEHI-3B/CPX cells were tested for topoisomerase I catalytic activity and checking in vitro topoisomerase I sensitivity to CPX and camptothecin inhibition, but no difference was observed. As the treatment with CPX showed that the resistant cell line suffers a significantly lower number of breaks in the DNA molecule we also addressed our investigations to the topoisomerase II-dependent DNA cleavage that, in the resistant clone, was found dramatically less susceptible to be enhanced by CPX both in pre-strand and post-strand DNA passage conditions. WEHI-3B/CPX cells do not express any character of multidrug resistance and represent a rare case of specific drug resistance to CPX. The specific resistance to CPX observed in these cells is related to a functional decrease of topoisomerase II cleavage activity. It could be consequent to a decreased binding affinity of CPX for the topoisomerase II--DNA complex or to a decreased affinity or specificity of topoisomerase II for its DNA cleavage sites.","['Pessina, A', 'Raimondi, A', 'Croera, C', 'Acchini, M', 'Mineo, E', 'Foti, P', 'Neri, M G']","['Pessina A', 'Raimondi A', 'Croera C', 'Acchini M', 'Mineo E', 'Foti P', 'Neri MG']","['Institute of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Milan, 20133 Milan, Italy. pessinaa@mailserver.unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ciprofloxacin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200106000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2001 Jun;12(5):441-51. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200106000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, J4 is more cytostatic and cytotoxic than J1 and J7, suggesting that methyl and methoxy substitutions, a p-quinone moiety, and a hydrogen bonding phenolic group may enhance the antitumor potential of these naphthoquinone lactones, which are all more potent than EA and GEN. For instance, the lead compound J4 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and viability at day 4 (IC(50): 0.24--0.65 microM) more effectively than EA (IC(50): 5--6 microM) and GEN (IC(50): 7 microM). Since J4 does not increase but rather decreases the mitotic index of L1210 cells at 24 h, it is not an antitubulin drug but might arrest early stages of cell cycle progression like EA and GEN. A 1.5- to 3-h pretreatment with J4 is sufficient to inhibit the rates of DNA, RNA and protein syntheses (IC(50): 2.0--2.5 microM) determined over 30- to 60-min periods of pulse-labeling in L1210 cells in vitro, whereas EA (IC(50): 20-130 microM) and GEN (IC(50): 40--115 microM) are less effective against macromolecule synthesis. In contrast to 156 microM EA, which is inactive, a 15-min pretreatment with 10--25 microM J4 has the advantage of also inhibiting the cellular transport of both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides over a 30 s period in vitro, an effect which can be mimicked by 156 microM GEN. Hence, the WS-5995 analogs and GEN may prevent the incorporation of [(3)H]adenosine and [(3)H]thymidine into DNA because they rapidly block the uptake of these nucleosides by the tumor cells. After 24 h, the concentration-dependent induction of DNA cleavage by J4 peaks at 10 microM and declines at 25 microM, whereas EA and GEN are ineffective at 10 microM but maximally stimulate DNA cleavage at 62.5 microM. Like EA and GEN, the mechanism by which J4 induces DNA fragmentation is inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and ZnSO(4), suggesting that J4 triggers apoptosis by caspase and endonuclease activation. Because they are more potent than EA and GEN, and affect both nucleoside transport and DNA cleavage, the WS-5995 antitumor antibiotics might be valuable in polychemotherapy to potentiate the action of antimetabolites and sensitize multidrug-resistant tumor cells.","['Perchellet, E M', 'Sperfslage, B J', 'Qabaja, G', 'Jones, G B', 'Perchellet, J P']","['Perchellet EM', 'Sperfslage BJ', 'Qabaja G', 'Jones GB', 'Perchellet JP']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Kansas State University, Division of Biology, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506-4901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '19YRN3ZS9P (Ellagic Acid)', '76191-51-0 (WS-5995 A)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Ellagic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Mitotic Index', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects', 'Quinones', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200106000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2001 Jun;12(5):401-17. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200106000-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clinicopathologic study of 20 cases.,742-51,"Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/immunocytoma (LLI) was defined initially as a small B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytoid or plasmacytic features. Because other types of small B-cell lymphoma, particularly marginal zone B-cell lymphoma may exhibit plasmacytic differentiation, the revised European-American lymphoma classification and World Health Organization has defined LLI more narrowly to exclude other small B-cell lymphomas. The goal of this study was to reevaluate LLI as a clinicopathologic entity. Twenty cases were selected from 43 previously diagnosed as ""small lymphocytic lymphoma, plasmacytoid"" or ""immunocytoma"" from 1985 to 1998. Cases fulfilling the criteria for B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, or other types of B-cell lymphoma were excluded. The histopathology and immunoreactivity for CD20, CD79a, CD3, CD43, CD23, CD5, kappa, lambda, and immunoglobulins (Ig's) M, G, and A were reviewed, in addition to available clinical findings. There were 13 men and seven women, with a mean age of 69 years. Five patients had documented Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Three architectural patterns were observed. Pattern A (seven of 20) showed open sinuses, small follicles, and hemosiderosis; pattern B (four of 20) showed hyperplastic follicles; and pattern C (nine of 20) showed diffuse effacement. Epithelioid histiocytes were prominent in patterns B and C but absent in A. Cytologically, six of 20 were polymorphous with 10% to 40% transformed cells; 14 of 20 were lymphoplasmacytic. Five cases showed minor foci of monocytoid B cells. One case showed a composite histology of LLI and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Amyloid was present in two cases. All cases were CD20 and/or CD79a immunoreactive, with two of 20 positive for CD43. Twelve cases were kappa monoclonal and eight cases were lambda monoclonal. Twelve of 17 cases that could be evaluated were positive for IgM and five were positive for IgG. All cases were negative for CD5 and CD23 with the exception of the one case with a composite histology. Eleven of 20 patients with available follow-up died of disease (median, 48 months), and eight of 20 are alive with disease at a follow-up of 6 months to 2 years. LLI does appear to represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity even though it shows morphologic heterogeneity and overlapping features with marginal zone B-cell lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Recognition of LLI is important because the overall prognosis may be worse than for other types of small B-cell lymphomas.","['Andriko, J A', 'Swerdlow, S H', 'Aguilera, N I', 'Abbondanzo, S L']","['Andriko JA', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Aguilera NI', 'Abbondanzo SL']","['Department of Hematopathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-200106000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2001 Jun;25(6):742-51. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200106000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because individual telomeres in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance appear to periodically become extremely short, cells using this pathway to maintain telomeres may be faced with a continuous state of crisis. We expressed telomerase in a human cell line that uses the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance to test whether telomerase would prevent telomeres from becoming critically short and examine the effects that this might have on the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance. In these cells, telomerase maintains the length of the shortest telomeres. In some cases, the long heterogeneous telomeres are completely lost, and the cells now permanently contain short telomeres after only 40 population doublings. This corresponds to a telomere reduction rate of 500 base pairs/population doubling, a rate that is much faster than expected for normal telomere shortening but is consistent with the rapid telomere deletion events observed in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance (Murnane, J. P., Sabatier, L., Marder, B. A., and Morgan, W. F. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 4953-4962). We also observed reductions in the fraction of cells containing alternative lengthening of telomere-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies and extrachromosomal telomere repeats; however, no alterations in the rate of sister chromatid exchange were observed. Our results demonstrate that human cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance retain factors required for telomerase to maintain telomeres and that once the telomerase-based pathway of telomere length regulation is engaged, recombination-based elongation of telomeres can be functionally inhibited.","['Ford, L P', 'Zou, Y', 'Pongracz, K', 'Gryaznov, S M', 'Shay, J W', 'Wright, W E']","['Ford LP', 'Zou Y', 'Pongracz K', 'Gryaznov SM', 'Shay JW', 'Wright WE']","['Department of Cell Biology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9039, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Recombination, Genetic/*physiology', 'Telomerase/*physiology', '*Telomere']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M104469200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)31537-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 24;276(34):32198-203. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M104469200.

Its open reading frame of 2079 base pairs encodes a predicted polypeptide of 693 amino acids named CDA1 (cell division autoantigen-1). CDA1 has a predicted molecular mass of 79,430 Daltons and a pI of 4.26. The size of the cDNA is consistent with its estimated mRNA size. CDA1 comprises an N-terminal proline-rich domain, a central basic domain, and a C-terminal bipartite acidic domain. It has four putative nuclear localization signals and potential sites for phosphorylation by cAMP and cGMP-dependent kinases, protein kinase C, thymidine kinase, casein kinase II, and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDA1 is phosphorylated in HeLa cells and by cyclin D1/CDK4, cyclin A/CDK2, and cyclin B/CDK1 in vitro. Its basic and acidic domains contain regions homologous to almost the entire human leukemia-associated SET protein. The same basic region is also homologous to nucleosome assembly proteins, testis TSPY protein, and an uncharacterized brain protein. CDA1 is present in the nuclear fraction of HeLa cells and localizes to the nucleus and nucleolus in HeLa cells transfected with CDA1 or its N terminus containing all four nuclear localization signals. Its acidic C terminus localizes mainly to the cytoplasm. CDA1 levels are low in serum-starved cells, increasing dramatically with serum stimulation. Expression of the CDA1 transgene, but not its N terminus, arrests HeLa cell growth, colony numbers, cell density, and bromodeoxyuridine uptake in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of CDA1 to arrest cell growth is abolished by mutation of the two CDK consensus phosphorylation sites. We propose that CDA1 is a negative regulator of cell growth and that its activity is regulated by its expression level and phosphorylation.","['Chai, Z', 'Sarcevic, B', 'Mawson, A', 'Toh, B H']","['Chai Z', 'Sarcevic B', 'Mawson A', 'Toh BH']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Monash University Medical School, Prahran, Victoria 3181, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (cell division autoantigen-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Autoantigens/*chemistry/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/*chemistry', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M007681200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)34762-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Sep 7;276(36):33665-74. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M007681200.

We used an animal model using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)/beige mice to study the pathogenesis of HHM. SCID/beige mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with a human ATL line (RV-ATL) and were euthanized 20 to 32 days after inoculation. SCID/beige mice with engrafted RV-ATL cells developed lymphoma in the mesentery, liver, thymus, lungs, and spleen. The lymphomas stained positively for human CD45RO surface receptor and normal mouse lymphocytes stained negatively confirming the human origin of the tumors. The ATL cells were immunohistochemically positive for parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). In addition, PTHrP mRNA was highly expressed in lymphomas when compared to MT-2 cells (HTLV-1-positive cell line). Mice with lymphoma developed severe hypercalcemia. Plasma PTHrP concentrations were markedly increased in mice with hypercalcemia, and correlated with the increase in plasma calcium concentrations. Bone densitometry and histomorphometry in lymphoma-bearing mice revealed significant bone loss because of a marked increase in osteoclastic bone resorption. RV-ATL cells contained 1.5 HTLV-1 proviral copies of the tax gene as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, tax expression was not detected by Western blot or reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in RV-ATL cells, which suggests that factors other than Tax are modulators of PTHrP gene expression. The SCID/beige mouse model mimics HHM as it occurs in ATL patients, and will be useful to investigate the regulation of PTHrP expression by ATL cells in vivo.","['Richard, V', 'Lairmore, M D', 'Green, P L', 'Feuer, G', 'Erbe, R S', 'Albrecht, B', ""D'Souza, C"", 'Keller, E T', 'Dai, J', 'Rosol, T J']","['Richard V', 'Lairmore MD', 'Green PL', 'Feuer G', 'Erbe RS', 'Albrecht B', ""D'Souza C"", 'Keller ET', 'Dai J', 'Rosol TJ']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43212, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Density', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cell Division', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/pathology/virology', 'Mice', '*Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64694-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64694-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2001 Jun;158(6):2219-28. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64694-9.,PMC1891995,,,"['R01 CA077911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-01474/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 RR000168/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K26 RR000168/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77567/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00168/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for CNS prophylaxis were studied. Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively. The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years. T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury. RESULTS: On MRI, 3 leukoencephalopathy (LEP) and 1 infarct were detected. Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin. On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr was associated with LEP. A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and NAA/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin. Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between NAA/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after CNS prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis. The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these brain lesions.","['Chan, Y L', 'Roebuck, D J', 'Yuen, M P', 'Yeung, K W', 'Lau, K Y', 'Li, C K', 'Chik, K W']","['Chan YL', 'Roebuck DJ', 'Yuen MP', 'Yeung KW', 'Lau KY', 'Li CK', 'Chik KW']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Organ Imaging, Prince of Wales Hospital, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. yl190chan@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '997-55-7 (N-acetylaspartate)', 'MU72812GK0 (Creatine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Brain/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Brain Infarction/chemically induced/etiology/metabolism', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/chemically induced/etiology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Creatine/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(01)01513-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(01)01513-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Jul 1;50(3):759-63. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(01)01513-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings correlate with prognosis and response to treatment in ALL patients. The purpose of this study was to define the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in a group of Mexican children with ALL and to compare these data with those reported in the literature. METHODS: Bone marrow chromosome studies with GTG bands were performed in 150 pediatric patients with ALL who were naive to antileukemic treatment and aged from 5 months to 16 years; the majority was diagnosed as L1. RESULTS: Among 131 patients, 30 (22.9%) karyotypes were normal and the remaining 101 (77.1%) had abnormal karyotypes with numerical and/or structural abnormalities. Among patients with numerical abnormalities, the most frequent karyotypes were hyperdiploidy with 51-65 chromosomes (30 patients) and hyperdiploidy with 47-50 chromosomes (18 patients). Among recurrent, non-random, and primary structural abnormalities, the most frequent was t(9;22), followed by t(1;19).

These processes involve a variety of molecules that are not unique in themselves but play unique roles in the process of implantation. Genes important to embryonic attachment include the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family (EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor and amphiregulin) and the cytokines (colony-stimulating factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin-1), as well as a variety of cell adhesion molecules and other glycoproteins. Epithelial factors important in attachment may be regulated by paracrine interactions via the endometrial epithelium and the endometrial stroma, which is a progesterone-responsive tissue. Investigations into genetic knockout animal models and natural mutations in the mouse have demonstrated that genes important to the implantation process affect both embryo attachment and decidualization and include cyclooxygenase-2 and the homeobox gene HOXA-10. Calcitonin is believed to play a role in preparing the apical cell pole for contact with the trophoblast. A number of factors contribute to endometrial regulation by progesterone; some are important in embryo attachment as well as in the invasive phase of implantation. Four specific factors regulated in the endometrial stroma by progesterone are transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (especially TIMP-3) and fibronectin, all of which have been demonstrated to inhibit trophoblast invasiveness. Current research should provide answers regarding the effects of various levels of progesterone on the implantation process.","['Giudice, L C']",['Giudice LC'],"[""Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Center for Research in Women's Health and Reproductive Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Reprod Med,The Journal of reproductive medicine,0173343,"['0 (Cytokines)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Endometrium/*physiology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/*pharmacology']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Reprod Med. 1999 Feb;44(2 Suppl):165-71.,,,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,

Male and female patients with a mean age of 34.5 +/- 10.6 years were recruited into the study. Interferon therapy was administered at a maintenance dose of 9 MIU daily for 12 months. Efficacy was evaluated by assessing both haematologic and cytogenetic response, tolerability by incidence of adverse events and safety by laboratory haematological and biochemical indices. At the end of 12 months of therapy 6 patients (54.4%) had complete haematologic remission whilst 3 patients (100% of those evaluated) showed partial cytogenetic remission. The incidence of adverse event was 70% and the monitored haematologic and biochemical indices were not adversely affected by treatment. In conclusion, the study clearly demonstrated a significant benefit of interferon alpha-2a in the management of Nigerian patients with CML.

Previous cytogenetic and molecular studies reported complex karyotypes with recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, including translocations involving either TCL1 at 14q32.1 or MTCP1 at Xq28, inactivation of the ATM gene by deletion and/or mutation, and isochromosomes 8. For extensive study of chromosomal imbalances in T-PLL, we analyzed 22 tumoral DNAs using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Abnormal CGH profiles were detected in all cases, demonstrating highly recurrent gains and losses and largely extending the abnormalities previously established. Only a few nonrecurrent abnormalities were observed, in contrast to the genetic instability anticipated from ATM inactivation. Nine recurrent regions of loss were identified at 8p (frequency 86%), 11q (68%), 22q11 (45%), 13q (41%), 6q (36%), 9p (27%), 12p (23%), 11p11-p14 (23%), and 17p (23%), as well as four regions of gain at 8q (82%), 14q32 (50%), 22q21-qter (41%), and 6p (23%). Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were simultaneously present in each case (mean, 5.7; up to 10), none being mutually exclusive of another. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed and extended 22q11 and 13q losses, giving final frequencies of 55% and 45%, respectively. Analysis of one case over a 7-year period confirmed the overall genetic stability of T-PLL and showed that tumor progression was associated with the onset of a few chromosomal abnormalities. This study establishes a complex pattern of highly recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in T-PLL, including some, such as chromosome 13 deletion, commonly found in other lymphoid malignancies.","['Soulier, J', 'Pierron, G', 'Vecchione, D', 'Garand, R', 'Brizard, F', 'Sigaux, F', 'Stern, M H', 'Aurias, A']","['Soulier J', 'Pierron G', 'Vecchione D', 'Garand R', 'Brizard F', 'Sigaux F', 'Stern MH', 'Aurias A']","['Unite INSERM U509, Laboratoire de Pathologie Moleculaire des Cancers, Institut Curie, Paris, France. jsoulier@chu-stlouis.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.1141 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Jul;31(3):248-54. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1141.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of HCV infection in patients admitted to a hematology department in Paris, France. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: 813 patients admitted to the Hematology department (164 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 34 Hodgkin's diseases, 107 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 54 multiple myeloma, 12 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, 17 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 6 hairy cell leukemia, 189 myeloproliferative diseases, 6 solid organ tumors, and 224 nonmalignant diseases) and 694 patients admitted to the Internal Medicine department (control group). MEASUREMENTS: All patients were tested for antibodies to HCV by a third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: HCV antibodies were detected in 20 of 813 (2.46%) patients in Hematology including 11 of 394 (2.79%) patients with lymphoproliferative diseases, 3 of 164 (1.83%) B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 2 of 107 (1.87%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 of 54 (1.85%) multiple myeloma, 1 of 189 (0.5%) myeloproliferative diseases, and 8 of 224 (3.57%) nonmalignant hematologic diseases. HCV antibodies were detected in 3 of 694 (0.43%) patients in the control group. HCV contamination preceded B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma only in 2 of 3 HCV-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HCV infection was low (1.83%) in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. HCV seems not to play a major role in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma in France. Cofactors should be stressed to explain geographical discrepancies.","['Hausfater, P', 'Cacoub, P', 'Sterkers, Y', 'Thibault, V', 'Amoura, Z', 'Nguyen, L', 'Ghillani, P', 'Leblond, V', 'Piette, J C']","['Hausfater P', 'Cacoub P', 'Sterkers Y', 'Thibault V', 'Amoura Z', 'Nguyen L', 'Ghillani P', 'Leblond V', 'Piette JC']","[""Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, 83-87 Boulevard de l'Hopital, Paris, France. pierre.hausfater@psl.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C/complications/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.1101 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2001 Jul;67(3):168-71. doi: 10.1002/ajh.1101.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

This new approach allows for the incorporation of covariates within the framework of parametric models. The procedure is based upon the notion of fractional order statistics and is carried forth using a simple beta transformation of the estimated survival function (parametric or non-parametric). It is the only direct method currently available in the sense that all other methods are based on inverting test statistics or employing confidence intervals for other survival quantities.

The contribution of environmental and genetic factors has been explored in several high-incidence areas, but data on genetic influences are scarce for Western countries. Using data from a multicenter, population-based, case-control study on 1,143 cases and 695 controls in the United States, we evaluated whether a family history of digestive or other cancers was associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 293), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 221), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (n = 261) or non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 368). After adjusting for other risk factors, individuals reporting a family history of digestive cancers experienced no increased risk of either type of esophageal cancer but they were prone to adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia [odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.97] and non-cardia segments (OR =1.46, 95% CI 1.03-2.08). This familial tendency, particularly for non-cardia gastric tumors, was largely explained by an association with family history of stomach cancer (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.50-4.23). In addition, family history of breast cancer was associated with increased risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.07-2.83) and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.09-2.82). Also seen were non-significant familial associations of esophageal squamous-cell cancer with prostate cancer as well as non-cardia gastric cancer with leukemia and brain tumors, though these relationships must be interpreted with caution. Our data point to the role of familial susceptibility to gastric cancer, but not to any form of esophageal cancer, in the United States.","['Dhillon, P K', 'Farrow, D C', 'Vaughan, T L', 'Chow, W H', 'Risch, H A', 'Gammon, M D', 'Mayne, S T', 'Stanford, J L', 'Schoenberg, J B', 'Ahsan, H', 'Dubrow, R', 'West, A B', 'Rotterdam, H', 'Blot, W J', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Dhillon PK', 'Farrow DC', 'Vaughan TL', 'Chow WH', 'Risch HA', 'Gammon MD', 'Mayne ST', 'Stanford JL', 'Schoenberg JB', 'Ahsan H', 'Dubrow R', 'West AB', 'Rotterdam H', 'Blot WJ', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Program in Epidemiology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/epidemiology/genetics', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Demography', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Family', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Racial Groups', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1294 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1294 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jul 1;93(1):148-52. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1294.,,,,"['5U01-CA57923/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CN-05230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-40501/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK58834/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA57949/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA57983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

We blocked ceramide metabolism in a series of variably vincristine-resistant cell lines derived from CCRF-CEM leukemia cells using an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, DL-threo-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (PPPP). PPPP alone (1.0 microM), while nearly completely blocking glucosylceramide synthesis, was not toxic and did not increase cellular ceramide levels. Vincristine alone was toxic, caused apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) and caused an elevation in ceramide levels. Strikingly, the combination of PPPP and vincristine resulted in a further increase, over that of vincristine alone, of (i) cellular ceramide concentration, (ii) cytotoxicity associated with PCD and (iii) G2/M cell-cycle arrest. PPPP had no effect on P-glycoprotein expression or function. We conclude that vincristine cytotoxicity occurs in part through a ceramide-dependent mechanism, resulting in both G2/M block as well as PCD, and that the blockade of glucosylceramide synthase, in itself not toxic, causes augmented accumulation of ceramide resulting from vincristine exposure, which in turn maximizes ceramide-dependent, vincristine-induced cytotoxicity. Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis may be a means of circumventing drug resistance by enhancing signaling through a cell-death pathway.","['Olshefski, R S', 'Ladisch, S']","['Olshefski RS', 'Ladisch S']","[""Glycobiology Program, Center for Cancer and Transplantation Biology, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Propanolamines)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glucosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Propanolamines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*toxicity']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1301 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1301 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jul 1;93(1):131-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1301.,,,,['CA61010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with early recurrent prostate carcinoma as indicated by an increasing prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and without any evidence of metastatic disease were treated with oral etoposide 50 mg/m2/day and estramustine 15 mg/kg/day in divided doses for 21 days, followed by a 7-day rest period. Patients received a maximum of four cycles. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were entered in this study. The median serum PSA was 3.1 (range, 0.3-30.3) at the time of entry into the trial. Sixteen patients were assessable for response. Serum PSA declined to undetectable levels in 13 patients with 2 additional patients meeting the criteria for partial response; the median duration of response was 8.5 months (range, 1-18 months). Most patients developed gastrointestinal, cardiac, or hematologic complications. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (one patient), deep venous thrombosis (three patients), and chest pain (one patient). One patient developed acute myelogenous leukemia (French-American-British, acute myelogenous leukemia M5) 23 months after initiating the chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of oral etoposide and oral estramustine resulted in a high rate but only a short duration of response in patients with early recurrent prostate carcinoma. The regimen was poorly tolerated, and the toxicity was significant. This regimen should not be considered standard therapy for the treatment of early recurrent prostate carcinoma, but further exploration of treatment in this setting is warranted.","['Munshi, H G', 'Pienta, K J', 'Smith, D C']","['Munshi HG', 'Pienta KJ', 'Smith DC']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['35LT29625A (Estramustine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Estramustine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20010601)91:11<2175::AID-CNCR1246>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010601)91:11<2175::aid-cncr1246>3.0.co;2-d [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jun 1;91(11):2175-80. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010601)91:11<2175::aid-cncr1246>3.0.co;2-d.,,,,"['5-P30-CA46592-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA069568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

Also, little is known about the biologic characteristics of disease progression in CML. Bcl-2 expression has been demonstrated to exert an antiapoptotic effect resulting in increased cell survival. Other proteins such as Bax and Bad are proapoptotic proteins. Fas, a cell surface protein, can be triggered by an appropriate death-promoting ligand (FasL) to activate downstream caspases pivotal in initiation of programmed cell death. Although the mechanisms underlying cellular proliferative and apoptotic pathways are complex, with involvement of multiple interlocking proteins, the relative expression of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins may have an influence on disease progression. This study aimed to determine whether the changes in the cellular expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Fas correlate with caspase-3 activity and disease progression in CML, or with response to interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy and prognosis in early chronic phase CML. METHODS: Bcl-2, Bax, and Fas expression were measured on whole cell lysates from bone marrow mononuclear cell fractions by Western blot analysis and quantitative radioimmunoassay. Caspase-3 activity was determined using the DEVD system. Specimens from 203 patients with CML were examined. These included 130 patients in early chronic phase disease (ECP; diagnosis to therapy, < or =12 months), 33 patients in late chronic phase (diagnosis to therapy, > 12 months), 27 patients in accelerated phase, and 13 patients in blastic phase. Correlations between apoptosis proteins and CML phases, risk groups in ECP, and response to IFN-alpha therapy and survival in ECP were investigated by standard statistical methods, and positive findings were assessed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Levels of Bcl-2, Fas, Bax, and caspase-3 activity did not correlate with disease progression. Among patients in ECP, higher Fas levels correlated with poorer risk groups (P = 0.05) and higher caspase-3 activity correlated with better risk groups (P = 0.048). With IFN-alpha therapy, major cytogenetic responses were noted in 30% of patients with high Fas and 53% with low Fas (P = 0.016) and failure to achieve a complete hematologic response (CHR) in 25% versus 2% (P = 0.0001). Survival was shorter with high Fas levels (5-year rates, 71% vs. 52%; P = 0.002), and the independent poor prognostic significance of high Fas levels was confirmed by multivariate analysis (P = 0.014). Response to IFN-alpha therapy and survival were not significantly different by different levels of Bcl-2, Bax, or caspase-3 activity. CONCLUSIONS: High Fas levels were associated with intrinsically worse disease at diagnosis, whereas high caspase-3 activity was associated with good risk disease. In ECP CML, high Fas levels were associated with significantly worse response to IFN-alpha therapy and with significantly worse survival. The influence of these cellular proteins and caspase-3 activity on apoptosis in CML is complex and merits further investigation.","['Ravandi, F', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Faderl, S', 'Giles, F J', 'Thomas, D', 'Cortes, J', 'Andreeff, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Rios, M B', 'Albitar, M']","['Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Giles FJ', 'Thomas D', 'Cortes J', 'Andreeff M', 'Estrov Z', 'Rios MB', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Disease Progression', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Risk Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20010601)91:11<1964::AID-CNCR1221>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010601)91:11<1964::aid-cncr1221>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jun 1;91(11):1964-72. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010601)91:11<1964::aid-cncr1221>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study 75 subjects who were given the diagnosis of chALL between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1997 (69% standard, 31% high risk), at Denver Children's Hospital and who were 11 to 82 months post-diagnosis with no history of relapse, secondary malignancy, or transplant underwent whole body areal bone mineral densitometry (BMD(A) expressed as age- and sex-standardized z scores), a food frequency questionnaire, and a weight-bearing activity survey. RESULTS: Overall, the mean whole body BMD(A) z score was normal (+0.22 +/- 0.96). A significant positive association was found with whole body BMD(A) z score and years elapsed since the beginning of maintenance (linear regression coefficient = +0.2 Deltaz score/year; 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.3) after adjustment was done for risk status/age category, history of cranial radiation, and total days hospitalized. No association was found with high risk/older age at diagnosis, nutrient intake, chemotherapy dosage, or weight-bearing activity. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous reports in which cranial radiation and longer hospitalizations were prominent components of therapy, our study suggests that more recently treated patients with chALL do not have persistent abnormalities of bone mineral density after completion of therapy.","['Kadan-Lottick, N', 'Marshall, J A', 'Baron, A E', 'Krebs, N F', 'Hambidge, K M', 'Albano, E']","['Kadan-Lottick N', 'Marshall JA', 'Baron AE', 'Krebs NF', 'Hambidge KM', 'Albano E']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', '*Bone Density', 'Calcium/blood', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diet', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnesium/blood', 'Male', 'Phosphorus/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(01)04520-6 [pii]', '10.1067/mpd.2001.113102 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 2001 Jun;138(6):898-904. doi: 10.1067/mpd.2001.113102.,,,,"['DK07658/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK48520/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR00069/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, in this clinical situation, T cells specific for mHag have been isolated. Here, we addressed whether one can generate mHag-specific T cells in vitro, without any in vivo immunization, among healthy blood donors. METHODS: We used monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) as antigen presenting cells to induce primary responses between healthy HLA-identical siblings, in mixed lymphocyte dendritic cell reactions (MLDCRs). RESULTS: We show that CD4+ T-cell clones, specific for the mHag H-Y, can be generated in vitro. These clones were derived from a gender-mismatched positive MLDCR pair of HLA-identical siblings and were restricted by the HLA DQB1*0502 molecule. In addition, these CD4+ T clones were also able to lyse allogeneic targets with the same pattern of restriction and specificity than helper function. Finally, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blast cells were susceptible to lysis by these clones. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results predict that Mo-DCs could help to generate class II-associated, mHag-specific, T-cell lines or clones in vitro, between healthy blood donors, without any need of transplantation-mediated immunization.","['Eljaafari, A', 'Farre, A', 'Duperrier, K', 'Even, J', 'Vie, H', 'Michallet, M', 'Souillet, G', 'Catherine Freidel, A', 'Gebuhrer, L', 'Rigal, D']","['Eljaafari A', 'Farre A', 'Duperrier K', 'Even J', 'Vie H', 'Michallet M', 'Souillet G', 'Catherine Freidel A', 'Gebuhrer L', 'Rigal D']","[""Banque de Tissus et Cellules, Pavillon I, Hopital E.

In the kinetic proofreading model of cell signaling, responses occur only when a bound receptor undergoes a complete series of modifications. If the ligand dissociates prematurely, the receptor returns to its basal state and signaling is frustrated. We extend the model to deal with systems where aggregation of receptors is essential to signal transduction, and present a version of the model for systems where signaling depends on an extrinsic kinase.

We show that the extended model predicts modes of signaling that exhibit kinetic discrimination for some range of parameters but for other parameter values show little or no discrimination and thus escape kinetic proofreading.

To improve its yield, the effect of an increased concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) on growth and enzyme biosynthesis by the producer, cultivated in a 3 l bioreactor, was examined. Exposure to a 20% DO level caused a 1.7-fold increase of SOD activity compared to the DO-uncontrolled culture. Maximum enzyme productivity of SOD was approximately 300 x 10(3) U (kg wet biomass)(-1). The novel enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The presence of Cu and Zn were confirmed by atomic absorption spectrometry. The molecular mass of H. lutea Cu/Zn SOD was calculated to be 31870 Da for the whole molecule and 15936 Da for the structural subunits. The N-terminal sequence revealed a high degree of structural homology with Cu/Zn SOD from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources. H. lutea Cu/Zn SOD was used in an in vivo model for the demonstration of its protective effect against myeloid Graffi tumour in hamsters. Comparative studies revealed that the enzyme (i) elongated the latent time for tumour appearance, (ii) inhibited tumour growth in the early stage of tumour progression (73-75% at day 10) and (iii) increased the mean survival time of Graffi-tumour-bearing hamsters. Moreover, the fungal Cu/Zn SOD exhibited a strong protective effect on experimental influenza virus infection in mice. The survival rate increased markedly, the time of survival rose by 5.2 d and the protective index reached 86%. The H. lutea SOD protected mice from mortality more efficiently compared to the selective antiviral drug ribavirin and to commercial bovine SOD. In conclusion, our results suggest that appropriate use of the novel fungal SOD, applied as such or in combination with selective inhibitors, could outline a promising strategy for the treatment of myeloid Graffi tumour and influenza virus infection.","['Angelova, Maria', 'Dolashka-Angelova, Pavlina', 'Ivanova, Emilia', 'Serkedjieva, Julia', 'Slokoska, Ludmila', 'Pashova, Svetlana', 'Toshkova, Reneta', 'Vassilev, Spassen', 'Simeonov, Ivan', 'Hartmann, Hans-Jurgen', 'Stoeva, Stanka', 'Weser, Ulrich', 'Voelter, Wolfgang']","['Angelova M', 'Dolashka-Angelova P', 'Ivanova E', 'Serkedjieva J', 'Slokoska L', 'Pashova S', 'Toshkova R', 'Vassilev S', 'Simeonov I', 'Hartmann HJ', 'Stoeva S', 'Weser U', 'Voelter W']","['Institute of Microbiology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 26 Academician G.

In vitro assays of the recombinant wild-type protein purified from the conditionally defective mutant confirm that it is catalytically active. Mutagenesis of one of the presumptive RNase H-catalytic residues results in production of a protein variant incapable of rescue and which lacks activity in vitro. Analyses of additional active site mutants demonstrate that their encoded variant proteins lack robust activity yet are able to rescue the bacterial mutant. These results suggest that genetic complementation may be useful for in vivo screening of mutant viral RNase H gene fragments and in evaluating their function under conditions that more closely mimic physiological conditions.

This sensitivity is biologically important because it correlates inversely with the ability of certain LCMV strains to persist in mice (D. Moskophidis, M. Battegay, M. A. Bruendler, E. Laine, I. Gresser, and R. M. Zinkernagel, J. Virol. 68:1951-1955, 1994). The cellular oncoprotein PML is induced by both IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma, and PML binds the LCMV Z protein and becomes redistributed within cells from nucleus to cytoplasm upon LCMV infection. In the present study, increased PML expression results in diminished LCMV replication, implicating PML in the IFN sensitivity of LCMV. Virus production in PML -/- murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) exceeds virus production in PML +/+ MEF, and this difference is exacerbated by IFN treatment that upregulates PML expression. IFN-gamma also diminishes LCMV production in PML -/- cells; therefore, viral IFN sensitivity is not entirely due to PML. Both viral mRNA production and viral protein production decrease as PML expression increases. Here we propose that PML reduces LCMV transcription through its interaction with the Z protein.","['Djavani, M', 'Rodas, J', 'Lukashevich, I S', 'Horejsh, D', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Borden, K L', 'Salvato, M S']","['Djavani M', 'Rodas J', 'Lukashevich IS', 'Horejsh D', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Borden KL', 'Salvato MS']","['Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Center, 725 W.

Here we demonstrate that an HTLV-1-encoded protein, p12(I), resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi and physically binds to the free human major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains (MHC-I-Hc) encoded by the HLA-A2, -B7, and -Cw4 alleles. As a result of this interaction, the newly synthesized MHC-I-Hc fails to associate with beta(2)-microglobulin and is retrotranslocated to the cytosol, where it is degraded by the proteasome complex. Targeting of the free MHC-I-Hc, and not the MHC-I-Hc-beta(2)-microglobulin complex, by p12(I) represents a novel mechanism of viral interference and disrupts the intracellular trafficking of MHC-I, which results in a significant decrease in surface levels of MHC-I on human T-cells. These findings suggest that the interaction of p12(I) with MHC-1-Hc may interfere with antigen presentation in vivo and facilitate escape of HTLV-1-infected cells from immune recognition.","['Johnson, J M', 'Nicot, C', 'Fullen, J', 'Ciminale, V', 'Casareto, L', 'Mulloy, J C', 'Jacobson, S', 'Franchini, G']","['Johnson JM', 'Nicot C', 'Fullen J', 'Ciminale V', 'Casareto L', 'Mulloy JC', 'Jacobson S', 'Franchini G']","['Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, 41 Library Dr., Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C*04 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/metabolism', 'HLA-B7 Antigen/metabolism', 'HLA-C Antigens/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multienzyme Complexes/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*physiology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', '*Transcription Factors', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.13.6086-6094.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jul;75(13):6086-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.13.6086-6094.2001.,PMC114324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial cleavage forms the amino terminus of the NC protein and releases an immature CA, named CA1, with a spacer peptide at its carboxyl terminus. Cleavage of either 9 or 12 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus creates two mature CA species, named CA2 and CA3, that can be detected in avian sarcoma/leukemia virus (R. B. Pepinsky, I. A. Papayannopoulos, E. P. Chow, N. K. Krishna, R. C. Craven, and V. M. Vogt, J. Virol. 69:6430-6438, 1995). To study the importance of each of the three CA proteins, we introduced amino acid substitutions into each CA cleavage junction and studied their effects on CA processing as well as virus assembly and infectivity. Preventing cleavage at any of the three sites produced noninfectious virus. In contrast, a mutant in which cleavage at site 1 was enhanced so that particles contained CA2 and CA3 but little detectable CA1 was infectious. These results support the idea that infectivity of the virus is closely linked to proper processing of the carboxyl terminus to form two mature CA proteins.","['Xiang, Y', 'Thorick, R', 'Vana, M L', 'Craven, R', 'Leis, J']","['Xiang Y', 'Thorick R', 'Vana ML', 'Craven R', 'Leis J']","['Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106-4935, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*physiology', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*physiology', 'COS Cells', 'Capsid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Virus Assembly']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.13.6016-6021.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jul;75(13):6016-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.13.6016-6021.2001.,PMC114317,,,"['R01 CA047482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA052047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA047482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have observed that infection of thymic lymphocytes by the mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus (MCF MLV) during the preleukemic period resulted in an enhancement of apoptosis of these cells. To further study the ability of MCF MLVs to induce apoptosis and the role of this process in viral pathogenesis, we have developed an in vitro system of virus-induced apoptosis. MCF13 MLV infection of mink epithelial cells resulted in the production of cytopathic foci. In contrast, infection of mink cells with the 4070A amphotropic MLV did not produce any cytopathic effects. Staining of MCF13 MLV-infected cells with propidium iodide and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate indicated that virus-induced cell death was due to apoptosis. At 6 days postinfection, the percentage of apoptotic MCF13 MLV-infected cells was 27% compared with 2 to 3% for mock- or amphotropic MLV-infected cells, representing a 9- to 14-fold difference. Assays for caspase-3 activation confirmed the detection by flow cytometry of apoptosis of MCF13 MLV-infected cells. Large amounts of unintegrated linear viral DNA were detectable by Southern blot analysis during the acute phase of infection, which indicated that MCF13 MLV is able to superinfect mink cells. Unintegrated viral DNA of only the linear form was detectable in thymic lymphocytes isolated from MCF13 MLV-inoculated mice during the preleukemic period. These results indicated that the ability of MCF13 MLV to induce apoptosis is correlated with its ability to superinfect cells and that this occurs as an early step in thymic lymphoma development.","['Yoshimura, F K', 'Wang, T', 'Nanua, S']","['Yoshimura FK', 'Wang T', 'Nanua S']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Wayne State University, 540 E.

Although no structural or biochemical defects in Nef-defective HIV-1 particles have been demonstrated, the Nef protein is incorporated into HIV-1 particles. To localize the function of Nef within the virus particle, we developed a novel technology involving fusion of enveloped donor HIV-1 particles bearing core defects with envelope-defective target virions bearing HIV-1 receptors. Although neither virus alone was capable of infecting CD4(+) target cells, the incubation of donor and target virions prior to addition to target cells resulted in infection. This effect, termed ""virion transcomplementation,"" required a functional Env protein on the donor virus and CD4 and an appropriate coreceptor on target virions. To provide evidence for intervirion fusion as the mechanism of complementation, experiments were performed using dual-enveloped HIV-1 particles bearing both HIV-1 and ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MLV) Env proteins as donor virions. Infection of CD4-negative target cells bearing E-MLV receptors was prevented by HIV-1 entry inhibitors when added before, but not after, incubation of donor and target virions prior to the addition to cells. When we used Nef(+) and Nef(-) donor and target virions, Nef enhanced infection when present in donor virions. In contrast, no effect of Nef was detected when present in the target virus. These results reveal a potential mechanism for enhancing HIV-1 diversity in vivo through the rescue of defective viral genomes and provide a novel genetic system for the functional analysis of virion-associated proteins in HIV-1 infection.","['Zhou, J', 'Aiken, C']","['Zhou J', 'Aiken C']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232-2363, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Gene Products, nef/*physiology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Virion/*physiology', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.13.5851-5859.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jul;75(13):5851-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.13.5851-5859.2001.,PMC114300,,,"['R01 AI040364/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI047056/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI40364/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI47056/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary goal is to explore concurrent variables associated with parental avoidance after treatment ends. METHODS: This is a longitudinal follow-up study of 113 parents of children treated for leukemia who previously participated in a study of procedural distress during treatment. Data included parental self-report questionnaires completed during treatment and after treatment. RESULTS: Using hierarchical multiple regression, we found anxiety during treatment to be a significant predictor of later PTSS for mothers, but not fathers. Anxiety, self-efficacy, posttraumatic growth and length of time since treatment ended were associated with parental avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Highly anxious parents are at risk for PTSS and may benefit from approaches that decrease anxiety during treatment and afterward. Enhancing self-efficacy related to follow-up care and identifying positive aspects of the traumatic experiences are suggested as treatment approaches for families after cancer treatment.","['Best, M', 'Streisand, R', 'Catania, L', 'Kazak, A E']","['Best M', 'Streisand R', 'Catania L', 'Kazak AE']","[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4399, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control/*psychology', 'Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Efficacy', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control/*psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jpepsy/26.5.299 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2001 Jul-Aug;26(5):299-307. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/26.5.299.,,,,['CA63930/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From a database of all patients with a diagnosis of leukemia from January 1990 to April 2000, 12 children (9 male, 3 female; mean age, 8.0 y; age range, 4.7--13.2 y) were identified for whom the diagnosis of leukemia was suggested on the basis of bone scans obtained as part of the initial work-up for unexplained skeletal pain. Early and delayed whole-body bone scans and radiographs were reviewed retrospectively. Areas of abnormal uptake on early and delayed phases were categorized into locations: metaphysis--diaphysis--epiphysis (MDE), pelvis, ribs, spine, and others. MDE lesions included abnormalities in the metaphysis extending into the diaphysis for some length: metaphysis/diaphysis, metaphysis only, diaphysis only, epiphysis only, and the entire bone. Pelvic and spine lesions were further characterized as focal or diffuse. RESULTS: Ten patients had lesions in 2 or more locations on both phases. Two patients had multiple lesions on the early scans but only rib lesions on the delayed scans. Lesions correlated with symptomatic sites in 8 patients on the delayed scans and in 11 patients on the early scans. The most common sites of abnormalities on the delayed scans were metaphyseal/diaphyseal, pelvis (focal), and ribs. The most common locations of lesions on the early scans were metaphyseal/diaphyseal, pelvis (diffuse or focal), and spine. More metaphyseal/diaphyseal lesions were seen on the early scans than on the delayed scans. Diffuse involvement of the pelvis and spine was seen only on the early phase. However, rib lesions were seen more frequently on the delayed scan. CONCLUSION: Early whole-body imaging in conjunction with delayed whole-body scanning may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of bone scanning in the evaluation of children with skeletal pain of obscure etiology, such as that associated with leukemia.","['Shalaby-Rana, E', 'Majd, M']","['Shalaby-Rana E', 'Majd M']","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Radiology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', 'X89XV46R07 (Technetium Tc 99m Medronate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone and Bones/*diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diaphyses/diagnostic imaging', 'Epiphyses/diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Pelvic Bones/diagnostic imaging', 'Radionuclide Imaging', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ribs/diagnostic imaging', 'Spine/diagnostic imaging', '*Technetium Tc 99m Medronate', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2001 Jun;42(6):878-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to GM-CSF delays apoptosis as measured by annexin-V staining and cell morphological change. We found that STAT5B, STAT1, and STAT3 DNA-binding activity was induced by GM-CSF. We also detected activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway after GM-CSF treatment which was inhibited by treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002. We investigated whether STAT or PI 3-kinase activity was necessary for the pro-survival response of GM-CSF in PMN. Exposure of PMN to GM-CSF in the presence of either AG-490, antisense STAT3 oligonucleotides, or wortmannin resulted in a partial inhibition of GM-CSF-mediated pro-survival activity. GM-CSF induced a time-dependent increase in the mRNA and protein expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-family protein, Mcl-1. We examined the hypothesis that Janus kinase/STAT and PI 3-kinase regulation of Mcl-1 contributed to GM-CSF-delayed apoptosis. Using either AG-490 or wortmannin alone, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of GM-CSF-induced Mcl-1 expression. Using suboptimal doses of AG-490 and wortmannin, we found that both drugs together had an additive effect on delayed apoptosis and Mcl-1 expression. These data suggest that cooperative regulation of Mcl-1 by the Janus kinase/STAT and PI 3-kinase pathways contribute to GM-CSF-delayed apoptosis.","['Epling-Burnette, P K', 'Zhong, B', 'Bai, F', 'Jiang, K', 'Bailey, R D', 'Garcia, R', 'Jove, R', 'Djeu, J Y', 'Loughran, T P Jr', 'Wei, S']","['Epling-Burnette PK', 'Zhong B', 'Bai F', 'Jiang K', 'Bailey RD', 'Garcia R', 'Jove R', 'Djeu JY', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Wei S']","['Hematologic Malignancy Program, H.

At the same concentrations, the membrane-impermeant conjugate of progesterone with BSA was ineffective, suggesting that binding to an intracellular receptor was needed for progesterone activity. Stimulation of FAAH occurred through up-regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and translational level, and was partly mediated by the Th2 cytokines. In fact, lymphocyte treatment with IL-4 or with IL-10 had a stimulating effect on FAAH, whereas the Th1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma reduced the activity and the protein expression of FAAH. Human chorionic gonadotropin or cortisol had no effect on FAAH activity. At variance with FAAH, the lymphocyte anandamide transporter and cannabinoid receptors were not affected by treatment with progesterone or cytokines. Good FAAH substrates such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol inhibited the release of leukemia-inhibitory factor from human lymphocytes, but N-palmitoylethanolamine, a poor substrate, did not. A clinical study performed on 100 healthy women showed that a low FAAH activity in lymphocytes correlates with spontaneous abortion, whereas anandamide transporter and cannabinoid receptors in these cells remain unchanged.

For lymphoid chromosomal translocations, misrecognition by the RAG (recombination activating gene) complex of V(D)J recombination is one contributing factor that has long been proposed. The chromosomal translocations involving LMO2 (t(11;14)(p13;q11)), Ttg-1 (t(11;14)(p15;q11)), and Hox11 (t(10;14)(q24;q11)) are among the clearest examples in which it appears that a D or J segment has synapsed with an adventitious heptamer/nonamer at a gene outside of one of the antigen receptor loci. The interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving SIL (SCL-interrupting locus)/SCL (stem cell leukemia) is a case involving two non-V(D)J sites that have been suggested to be V(D)J recombination mistakes. Here we have used our human extrachromosomal substrate assay to formally test the hypothesis that these regions are V(D)J recombination misrecognition sites and, more importantly, to quantify their efficiency as V(D)J recombination targets within the cell. We find that the LMO2 fragile site functions as a 12-signal at an efficiency that is only 27-fold lower than that of a consensus 12-signal. The Ttg-1 site functions as a 23-signal at an efficiency 530-fold lower than that of a consensus 23-signal. Hox11 failed to undergo recombination as a 12- or 23-signal and was at least 20,000-fold less efficient than consensus signals. SIL has been predicted to function as a 12-signal and SCL as a 23-signal. However, we find that SIL actually functions as a 23-signal. These results provide a formal demonstration that certain chromosomal fragile sites can serve as RAG complex targets, and they determine whether these sites function as 12- versus 23-signals. These results quantify one of the three major factors that determine the frequency of these translocations in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Raghavan, S C', 'Kirsch, I R', 'Lieber, M R']","['Raghavan SC', 'Kirsch IR', 'Lieber MR']","['Department of Pathology, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90089-9176, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genes, RAG-1', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'VDJ Recombinases']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M103797200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)80377-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 3;276(31):29126-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M103797200.

During the entire observation period, all-cause and all-cancer mortality did not increase. Fifteen years after the accident, mortality among men in high-exposure zones A (804 inhabitants) and B (5,941 inhabitants) increased from all cancers (rate ratio (RR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 1.7), rectal cancer (RR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.6), and lung cancer (RR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.7), with no latency-related pattern for rectal or lung cancer. An excess of lymphohemopoietic neoplasms was found in both genders (RR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.5). Hodgkin's disease risk was elevated in the first 10-year observation period (RR = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.5, 16.4), whereas the highest increase for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 7.0) and myeloid leukemia (RR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 12.5) occurred after 15 years. No soft tissue sarcoma cases were found in these zones (0.8 expected). An overall increase in diabetes was reported, notably among women (RR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.6). Chronic circulatory and respiratory diseases were moderately increased, suggesting a link with accident-related stressors and chemical exposure.

In this study, we present a generation four polyamidoamine (PAMAM) folate-dendrimer that specifically targets the high affinity folate receptor (hFR) overexpressed on more than 80% of ovarian tumors. In vitro, mouse erythroleukemia cells expressing the hFR bind the radiolabeled folate-dendrimer chelate resulting in over 2700% increase in binding compared with untreated cells. The binding was inhibited by free folic acid to levels observed on folate-receptor-negative cells. In vivo, ovarian tumor xenografts resulted in a 33% contrast enhancement, following the folate-dendrimer chelate administration, that was significantly different compared with results obtained with a non-specific, extracellular fluid space agent, Gd-HP-DO3A. In addition, this contrast enhancement was absent in saline-treated animals, folate-receptor-negative tumors, and was inhibited by free folic acid. Results suggest that a macromolecular, dendrimeric MRI agent with high molecular relaxivities (1646 mM(-1) s(-1)) can be used in specifically targeting the hFR on tumor cells and ovarian tumors.","['Konda, S D', 'Aref, M', 'Wang, S', 'Brechbiel, M', 'Wiener, E C']","['Konda SD', 'Aref M', 'Wang S', 'Brechbiel M', 'Wiener EC']","['Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Laboratory, College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,MAGMA,"Magma (New York, N.Y.)",9310752,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0199MV609F (gadoteridol)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'AU0V1LM3JT (Gadolinium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/pharmacokinetics', 'Gadolinium/pharmacokinetics', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacokinetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Radioligand Assay', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1352866101001065 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02668091 [doi]']",ppublish,MAGMA. 2001 May;12(2-3):104-13. doi: 10.1007/BF02668091.,,,,"['1R29-CA61918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1S10-RR06243/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5P41-RR05964/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07143/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adhesion induced by PMA stimulation was prevented by 44.5% by physiological concentrations of alpha-tocopherol. Under the same experimental conditions, beta-tocopherol, an analogue of alpha-tocopherol, produced 11% inhibition of adhesion. Cell response gradually increased from 0 to 24 h of alpha-tocopherol treatment. Only a slight time dependency of beta-tocopherol inhibition was observed. Another human erythroleukemia cell line (K562) and the human monocyte tumor cell line U937 showed 5.0 and 11.2% inhibition, respectively. Similar to alpha-tocopherol, the protein kinase C inhibitor, Calphostin C, and the MAPK inhibitor, PD98059, prevented PMA-induced cell adhesion. An inhibition of ERK-1 phosphorylation was observed for alpha-tocopherol only in HEL, implying that MAP kinase pathway is involved in this cell line. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), by using various integrin-specific monoclonal antibodies, has shown that alpha (1-6), beta1, and alphav integrins are less expressed at the cell surface after alpha-tocopherol treatment.

In this article anti-RTF antibody-induced apoptosis of both unstimulated and activated T lymphocytes. RTF expression was examined in human PBMC or purified T lymphocytes after their in vitro activation. Kinetic studies indicated maximal RTF cell surface expression on activated T lymphocytes occurred between expression of the early activation antigen CD69 and the IL-2alpha receptor (CD25) by multiparameter flow cytometry. RTF receptor expression correlated with Fas (CD95) and CD25 receptor expression (r2 = 0.6 and 0.5, respectively). RTF surface expression was dependent on the stimuli used to activate T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes obtained maximal RTF expression when activated through the TCR signal complex using anti-CD3epsilon antibody alone when compared with T lymphocytes activated with costimulation provided by anti-CD28 antibody alone or with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3epsilon antibody. RTF is expressed under conditions of both activation and anergy. The RTFs increased concentration on the surface of anergic T cells may protect these cells from apoptosis because increased RTF concentrations inhibited anti-RTF induced apoptosis. These data further characterize the expression of RTF on activated T lymphocytes and the role of anti-RTF antibody in T-lymphocyte apoptosis.","['Boomer, J S', 'Derks, R A', 'Lee, G W', 'DuChateau, B K', 'Gilman-Sachs, A', 'Beaman, K D']","['Boomer JS', 'Derks RA', 'Lee GW', 'DuChateau BK', 'Gilman-Sachs A', 'Beaman KD']","['Clinical Immunology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Finch University of Health Sciences, The Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Regeneration and tolerance factor, human)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0198885901002440 [pii]', '10.1016/s0198-8859(01)00244-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2001 Jun;62(6):577-88. doi: 10.1016/s0198-8859(01)00244-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the steady-state mRNA levels of tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases between segments of the mouse uterus undergoing decidualization compared to those that are not during early pregnancy plus oil-induced decidualization. Steady-state tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 mRNA levels were significantly greater in implantation compared to interimplantation areas on days 6 and 7 of pregnancy and in stimulated compared to nonstimulated uterine horns at 48 and 72 hr after artificial induction of decidualization. Steady-state tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 mRNA levels were significantly greater in implantation compared to interimplantation areas on days 5-8 of pregnancy and in stimulated compared to nonstimulated uterine horns at 24, 48, and 72 hr after oil stimulation. Therefore, the steady-state mRNA levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and -3 increased in the uterus during decidualization. The second objective of this study was to determine if transforming growth factor-beta1 influences tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase mRNA concentrations in mouse endometrial stromal cells.

A number of nuclear regulatory proteins initially identified due to their involvement in human cancer are localized to discrete nuclear matrix-attached foci and correct nuclear partitioning likely plays a role in their function. Two such examples are promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and acute myelogenous leukemia-1 (AML-1; Runx1). PML, the target of the t(15;17) in acute PML, is localized to PML nuclear bodies (also termed Nuclear Domain 10 and PML oncogenic domains), a nuclear matrix-associated body whose function appears to be quite complex, with probable roles in cancer, apoptosis, and in acute viral infections. In t(15;17)-containing leukemic cells, the PML nuclear bodies are disrupted, but reform when the leukemic cells are induced to differentiate in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid. AML1 (RUNX1) is a key regulator of hematopoietic differentiation and AML1 proteins are found in nuclear compartments that reflect their roles in transcriptional activation and repression. The t(8;21), associated with AML, results in a chimeric transcription factor, AML-1/ETO (eight twenty one), that remains attached to the nuclear matrix through targeting signals contained in the ETO protein. When co-expressed, ETO and AML-1/ETO co-localize to a nuclear compartment distinct from that of AML1 or PML nuclear bodies. Interestingly, enforced expression of ETO or AML-1/ETO changes the average number of PML nuclear bodies per cell. Thus, chromosomal translocations involving AML1 result in altered nuclear trafficking of the transcription factor as well as other changes to the nuclear architecture. J. Cell. Biochem.

A formidable challenge is to define further the control of transcription factor targeting to acceptor sites associated with the nuclear matrix. It will be important to determine whether acceptor proteins are associated with a pre-existing core-filament structural lattice or whether a compositely organized scaffold of regulatory factors is dynamically assembled. An inclusive model for all steps in the targeting of proteins to subnuclear sites cannot yet be proposed. However, this model must account for the apparent diversity of intranuclear targeting signals. It is also important to assess the extent to which regulatory discrimination is mediated by subnuclear domain-specific trafficking signals. Furthermore, the checkpoints that monitor subnuclear distribution of regulatory factors and the sorting steps that ensure both structural and functional fidelity of nuclear domains in which replication and expression of genes occur must be biochemically and mechanistically defined. There is emerging recognition that placement of regulatory components of gene expression must be temporally and spatially coordinated to facilitate biological control. The consequences of breaches in nuclear structure-function relationships are observed in an expanding series of diseases that include cancer [Weis et al., 1994; Rogaia et al., 1997; Yano et al., 1997; Rowley, 1998; Zeng et al., 1998; McNeil et al., 1999; Tao and Levine, 1999a] and neurological disorders [Skinner et al., 1997]. As the repertoire of architecture-associated regulatory factors and cofactors expands, workers in the field are becoming increasingly confident that nuclear organization contributes significantly to control of transcription. To gain increased appreciation for the complexities of subnuclear organization and gene regulation, we must continue to characterize mechanisms that direct regulatory proteins to specific transcription sites within the nucleus so that these proteins are in the right place at the right time.

Specific transmembrane ligands activate Notch receptors on neighboring cells inducing the proteolytic liberation and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of Notch (N(IC)). Nuclear N(IC) associates with a transcriptional repressor known as C-promoter binding factor/RBP-J kappa, suppressor of hairless, or LAG-1, converting it from a repressor into an activator. Through physical interactions with chromatin remodeling enzymes and potentially with components of the transcriptional machinery, N(IC) activates target genes that mediate cell fate decisions. As Notch1 is disrupted via a chromosomal translocation in a subset of human T-cell leukemia, leading to a truncated polypeptide resembling N(IC), deregulated chromatin remodeling and transcription may fuel uncontrolled cell proliferation in this hematopoietic malignancy. This review summarizes the mechanics of Notch signaling and focuses on prospective molecular mechanisms for how constitutively active Notch might derail nuclear processes as an initiating step in T-cell leukemogenesis.

In addition, a specific site adjacent to exon 12 within this region of MLL is cleaved in cells undergoing apoptosis. We show here, using human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells, that irradiation and the apoptotic trigger anti-CD95 antibody are each able to initiate translocations at the MLL exon 12 cleavage site. The translocation junctions produced contain regions of microhomology consistent with operation of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair process. Participation of the NHEJ process is supported by the identification of the NHEJ component DNA-PKcs at the site of apoptotic cleavage. Suppression of DNA-PKcs function by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin compromises DNA end joining, increases site-specific cleavage within MLL, and eliminates MLL-restricted translocations. We propose that activation of apoptotic effector nucleases alone is sufficient to generate proleukemogenic translocations and raises the possibility that some of these may persist in cells that evade apoptotic execution and survive.","['Betti, C J', 'Villalobos, M J', 'Diaz, M O', 'Vaughan, A T']","['Betti CJ', 'Villalobos MJ', 'Diaz MO', 'Vaughan AT']","['Program in Molecular Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Loyola University Medical Center, 2160 South First Avenue, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/diagnostic imaging/physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Radiography', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/06/05 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/06/05 10:00'],"['2001/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jun 1;61(11):4550-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of use of CD antigen expression (immunophenotyping) for identification of leukemias has been constrained by the technique used, flow cytometry, which commonly specifies only three CD antigens in any one assay. Currently, leukemias and lymphomas are diagnosed using a combination of morphology, immunophenotype, cytochemistry, and karyotype. We have developed a rapid, simple procedure, which enables concurrent determination of 50 or more CD antigens on leukocytes or leukemia cells in a single analysis using a microarray of antibodies. A suspension of cells is applied to the array, and cells only bind to antibody dots for which they express the corresponding CD antigen. For patients with significantly raised leukocyte counts, the resulting dot pattern then represents the immunophenotype of those cells. For patients at earlier stages of disease, the diagnosis depends on recognition of dot patterns distinct from the background of normal leukocytes. Distinctive and reproducible dot patterns have been obtained for normal peripheral blood leukocytes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The consensus pattern for CD antigen expression found on CLL cells taken from 20 patients in descending order of cells bound was CD44, HLA-DR, CD37, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD52, CD45RA, CD22, CD24, CD45, CD23, CD21, CD71, CD11c, and CD9. The antigens that provided the best discrimination between CLL and normal peripheral blood leukocytes were CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD25, and CD37. Results obtained for the expression of 48 CD antigens from the microarray compared well with flow cytometry. The microarray enables extensive immunophenotyping, and the intact cells captured on antibody dots can be further characterized using soluble, fluorescently labeled antibodies.","['Belov, L', 'de la Vega, O', 'dos Remedios, C G', 'Mulligan, S P', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Belov L', 'de la Vega O', 'dos Remedios CG', 'Mulligan SP', 'Christopherson RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biomedical Research, University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/05 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/06/05 10:00'],"['2001/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jun 1;61(11):4483-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This terminal differentiation is associated with a resistant phenotype to apoptosis induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. The inhibition occurs upstream of the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the activation of procaspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9. By using cell-free systems, it was demonstrated that the mitochondrial pathway to cell death that involves mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release and cytosolic activation of procaspases by cytochrome c/dATP remains functional in TPA-differentiated U937 cells. Accordingly, 2 drugs recently shown to target the mitochondria, namely lonidamine and arsenic trioxide, bypass the resistance of TPA-differentiated U937 cells to classical anticancer drugs. Cell death induced by the 2 compounds is associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo from the mitochondria, activation of caspases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, the decreased glutathione content associated with the differentiation process amplifies the ability of arsenic trioxide to activate the mitochondrial pathway to cell death. Similar results were obtained by comparing undifferentiated and TPA-differentiated human HL60 leukemic cells. These data demonstrate that mitochondria-targeting agents bypass the resistance to classical anticancer drugs induced by TPA-mediated leukemic cell differentiation.

Based on previous studies showing that more than 95% of childhood B-lineage ALL express CD38, this study evaluated whether normal CD34(+)CD38(-) progenitors from children with B-lineage ALL could be isolated by flow cytometry. CD34(+) cells from bone marrow samples from 10 children with B-lineage ALL were isolated at day 28 of treatment, when clinical remission had been attained. The CD34(+) progenitor cells were flow cytometrically sorted into CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) populations. The absolute numbers of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells that could be isolated ranged from 401 to 6245. The cells were then analyzed for the presence of clonotypic rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vdelta2-Ddelta3 locus. Only patients whose diagnostic marrow had an informative TCR Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement were included in this study. Detection thresholds were typically 10(-4) to 10(-5) leukemic cells in normal marrow. In 6 of 10 samples analyzed, the sorted CD34(+)CD38(-) cells had no detectable Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangements. In 4 cases, the clonotypic leukemic Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement was detected in the CD34(+)CD38(-) population, indicating that the putative normal HSC population also contained leukemic cells. The data indicate that although most childhood ALL cells express CD34 and CD38, leukemic cells are also frequently present in the CD34(+)CD38(-) population. Therefore, strategies to isolate and transplant normal HSC from children with ALL will require a more stringent definition of the normal HSC than the CD34(+)CD38(-) phenotype.

In this study, the possible role of angiogenesis in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was explored. Bone marrow trephine biopsies from patients with APL showed significantly increased microvessel density and hot spot density compared with normal control bone marrow biopsies. To identify the mediators of angiogenesis in APL, quantitative and functional assays were performed using the NB4 APL cell line as a model system. Conditioned media (CM) from the NB4 cells strongly stimulated endothelial cell migration. CM from the NB4 cells contained high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but not basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Most important, the addition of neutralizing VEGF antibodies completely inhibited the ability of NB4 CM to stimulate endothelial cell migration, suggesting that APL angiogenesis is mediated by VEGF. The effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on APL angiogenesis was then studied. ATRA therapy resulted in a decrease in bone marrow microvessel density and hot spot density. CM from ATRA-treated APL cells did not stimulate endothelial cell migration. Finally, quantitative assays showed that ATRA treatment resulted in the abrogation of VEGF production by the NB4 cells. These results show that there is increased angiogenesis and VEGF production in APL and that ATRA therapy inhibits VEGF production and suppresses angiogenesis. The addition of specific antiangiogenic agents to differentiation therapy or chemotherapy should be explored.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot, and reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the translocation resulted in an H4/platelet-derived growth factor receptor betaR (PDGFbetaR) fusion transcript that incorporated 5' sequences from H4 fused in frame to 3' PDGFbetaR sequences encoding the transmembrane, WW-like, and tyrosine kinase domains. FISH combined with immunophenotype analysis showed that t(5;10)(q33;q22) was present in CD13(+) and CD14(+) cells but was not observed in CD3(+) or CD19(+) cells. H4 has previously been implicated in pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma as a fusion partner of RET. The H4/RET fusion incorporates 101 amino acids of H4, predicted to encode a leucine zipper dimerization domain, whereas the H4/PDGFbetaR fusion incorporated an additional 267 amino acids of H4. Retroviral transduction of H4/PDGFbetaR, but not a kinase-inactive mutant, conferred factor-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells and caused a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in a murine bone marrow transplantation assay of transformation. Mutational analysis showed that the amino-terminal H4 leucine zipper domain (amino acids 55-93), as well as H4 amino acids 101 to 386, was required for efficient induction of factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. Tryptophan-to-alanine substitutions in the PDGFbetaR WW-like domain at positions 566/593, or tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions at PDGFbetaR positions 579/581 impaired factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. H4/PDGFbetaR is an oncoprotein expressed in t(5;10)(q33;q22) atypical CML and requires dimerization motifs in the H4 moiety, as well as residues implicated in signal transduction by PDGFbetaR, for efficient induction of factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells.

BCL2 transgenic mice develop lymphoma at low frequency, hindering studies of tumorigenesis and its inhibition in the presence of such gene products. MCL1 is a member of the BCL2 family that is highly regulated endogenously and that promotes cell viability and immortalization when introduced exogenously. Mice expressing an MCL1 transgene in hematolymphoid tissues have now been monitored for an extended period and were found to develop lymphoma with long latency and at high probability (more than 85% over 2 years). In most cases, the disease was widely disseminated and of clonal B-cell origin. A variety of histologic subtypes were seen, prominently follicular lymphoma and diffuse large-cell lymphoma. MCL1 thus sets the stage for the development of lymphoma as does BCL2, disease occurring with high probability and recapitulating a spectrum of subtypes as seen in human patients. These findings with the transgene underscore the importance of the normal, highly regulated pattern of MCL1 expression, in addition to providing a model for studying tumorigenesis and its inhibition in the presence of a viability promoting BCL2 family member.

Chromosome imbalances, losses, and gains were more frequently observed in aggressive ATL than in indolent ATL, with significant differences between the 2 ATL subtypes at gains of 1q and 4q. An increased number of chromosomal imbalances was associated with a significantly shorter survival in all patients. A high number of chromosomal losses was associated with a poor prognosis in indolent ATL, whereas the presence of 7q+ was marginally associated with a good prognosis in aggressive ATL. Paired samples (ie, samples obtained at different sites from 4 patients) and sequential samples from 13 patients (from 6 during both chronic disease and acute crisis and from 7 during both acute onset and relapse) were examined by CGH and Southern blotting for HTLV-1. All but 2 paired samples showed differences on CGH assessment. Two chronic/crisis samples showed distinct results regarding both CGH and HTLV-1 integration sites, indicating clonal changes in ATL at crisis. In 11 patients, the finding of identical HTLV-1 sites and clonally related CGH results suggested a common origin of sequential samples. In contrast to chronic/crisis samples, CGH results with all acute/relapse sample pairs showed the presence of clonally related but not evolutional subclones at relapse, thereby suggesting marked chromosomal instability. In summary, clonal diversity is common during progression of ATL, and CGH alterations are associated with clinical course.

In addition to neuronal cells, active Cdk5 complexes have been reported in developing tissues, such as the embryonic muscle and ocular lens, and in human leukemia HL60 cells induced to differentiate by an exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3); however, its activator in these cells has not been demonstrated. The results of this study indicate that p35Nck5a is associated with Cdk5 in monocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Specifically, p35Nck5a is expressed in normal human monocytes and in leukemic cells induced to differentiate toward the monocytic lineage, but not in lymphocytes or cells induced to granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid. It is present in a complex with Cdk5 that has protein kinase activity, and when ectopically expressed together with Cdk5 in undifferentiated HL60 cells, it induces the expression of CD14 and ""nonspecific"" esterase, markers of monocytic phenotype. These observations not only indicate a functional relationship between Cdk5 and p35Nck5a, but also support a role for this complex in monocytic differentiation.

Of 281 patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated over a 14-year period, 41 (14.6%) had a diagnosis of AMKL. Six patients had Down syndrome and AMKL, 6 had secondary AMKL, and 29 had de novo AMKL. The median age of the 22 boys and 19 girls was 23.9 months (range, 6.7-208.9 months). The rate of remission induction was 60.5%, with a 48% rate of subsequent relapse. Patients with Down syndrome had a significantly higher 2-year event-free survival (EFS) estimate (83%) than did other patients with de novo AMKL (14%) or with secondary AMKL (20%; P < or =.038). Among patients who had de novo AMKL without Down syndrome, 2-year EFS was significantly higher after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (26%) than after chemotherapy alone (0%; P =.019) and significantly higher when performed during remission (46%) than when performed during persistent disease (0%; P =.019). The 5-year survival estimates were significantly lower for de novo AMKL (10%) than for other forms of de novo AML (42%; P <.001). Treatment outcome is very poor for patients with AMKL in the absence of Down syndrome. Remission induction is the most important prognostic factor. Allogeneic transplantation during remission offers the best chance of cure; in the absence of remission, transplantation offers no advantage over chemotherapy alone.

The detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) have been implicated in FcepsilonRI signaling because aggregated receptors emigrate to DRMs that are enriched in certain signaling components. We evaluated the role of DRMs in FcepsilonRI signaling by disruption of DRMs using a cholesterol-binding agent, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD). While treatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells with MBCD inhibits degranulation and Ca(2+) mobilization upon aggregation of FcepsilonRI, MBCD hardly affects the aggregation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcepsilonRI as well as other signaling molecules such as phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1). MBCD delocalizes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate from DRMs, which may prevent MBCD-treated cells from producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by means of activated PLC-gamma1. These data suggest an indispensable role for DRMs in the Ca(2+) response rather than tyrosine phosphorylation, and support a model of receptor phosphorylation in which aggregated FcepsilonRI is tyrosine phosphorylated outside DRMs by constitutively associated Src family kinase Lyn via a transphosphorylation mechanism.","['Yamashita, T', 'Yamaguchi, T', 'Murakami, K', 'Nagasawa, S']","['Yamashita T', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Murakami K', 'Nagasawa S']","['Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan. yamashit@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Cyclodextrins/pharmacology', 'Detergents/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', '*Receptor Aggregation/drug effects', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', '*beta-Cyclodextrins', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2001/06/05 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/06/05 10:00'],"['2001/06/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a002930 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 2001 Jun;129(6):861-8. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a002930.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical manifestations are: unusually severe or frequent infections or infections that do not respond to adequate treatment; an increased risk of certain malignancies; sometimes auto-immune manifestations. Delayed diagnosis and management of PID can lead to severe and irreversible complications or to death. PID can become manifest only in the adult; in common variable immune deficiency, the median age at diagnosis is between the 2nd and the 3rd decade of life. PID are often transmitted genetically; recent progresses in molecular biology have allowed more precise and earlier, including antenatal, diagnosis. Molecular treatment of 3 infants with a severe immunodeficiency has recently been achieved in April 2000. Those progresses were mostly based on the study of immunodeficiency databases. We present here the work of a Belgian group specialized in PID; meetings have started in June 1997. This group establishes guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PID, adapted to the local situation. The elaboration of a national register of PID is also underway; this has to provide all guaranties of anonymity to patients and families.

High dose chemotherapy and rhG-CSF were given for autologous peripheral blood stem cell mobilization; the chemotherapy should be intensive enough to reduce the patients' peripheral WBC to less than 1.0 x 10(9)/L, and the beginning of using rhG-CSF should be just at the time of WBC's rising from the nadir. rhGM-CSF and rhG-CSF were given sequentially for hematopoietic reconstitution after transplantation. The results showed that leukaphereses were successfully performed for peripheral blood stem cell collection. Sixteen cases needed apheresis only once, and 6 cases needed it twice.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred nineteen patients were entered onto this prospective randomized trial from 37 centers. Patients received standard remission induction therapy, and responding patients were randomized either to continue with a conventional consolidation/maintenance protocol (CC) or to receive high-dose therapy and ASCT. In some centers, patients with HLA-identical sibling donors were registered on the trial but proceeded to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) without randomization. RESULTS: Of the 119 patients entered, 111 were assessable for response to induction therapy. The overall response rate was 82% (56% complete response, 26% partial response). Of the 98 patients eligible for randomization, 65 were randomized, 31 to ASCT and 34 to CC. Reasons for failure to randomize included patient refusal (12 patients), early progression or death on induction therapy (eight patients), excessive toxicity of induction regimen (six patients), and elective allogeneic BMT (12 patients). With a median follow-up of 37 months, the actuarial 3-year relapse-free survival rate is 24% for the CC arm and 55% for the ASCT arm (hazards ratio = 0.55 in favor of the ASCT arm; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 1.04; P =.065). The corresponding figures for overall survival are 45% and 56%, respectively (hazards ratio = 0.87 in favor of the ASCT arm; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.81; P =.71). CONCLUSION: The use of ASCT in adults with lymphoblastic lymphoma in first remission produced a trend for improved relapse-free survival but did not improve overall survival compared with conventional-dose therapy in this small randomized trial.","['Sweetenham, J W', 'Santini, G', 'Qian, W', 'Guelfi, M', 'Schmitz, N', 'Simnett, S', 'Nagler, A', 'Holte, H', 'Kvaloy, S', 'Bruzzi, P', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Sweetenham JW', 'Santini G', 'Qian W', 'Guelfi M', 'Schmitz N', 'Simnett S', 'Nagler A', 'Holte H', 'Kvaloy S', 'Bruzzi P', 'Goldstone AH']","['Cancer Research Campaign Wessex Medical Oncology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. john.sweetenham@uchsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.11.2927 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jun 1;19(11):2927-36. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.11.2927.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The hematopathologist, who was blinded to patients' molecular status, reviewed the referral bone marrows and peripheral-blood smears from 26 patients with Philadelphia (Ph) translocation-negative CML who lacked Bcr rearrangement (and other evidence of a Bcr-Abl anomaly) and 14 patients (controls) with chronic-phase Ph-positive CML. Clinical data was ascertained by chart review. RESULTS: Among the 26 M-bcr rearrangement-negative CML patients, three pathologic subtypes emerged: (1) patients indistinguishable from classic CML (n = 9), (2) patients with atypical CML (n = 8), and (3) patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (n = 9). Among the 14 patients with Ph-positive CML who were included in the blinded review, 13 were classified as classic CML, and one was classified as atypical CML. The only statistically significant difference between M-bcr rearrangement-negative subgroups was in the proportion of patients having karyotypic abnormalities, an observation common only in patients with atypical CML (P = 0.008). However, the small number of patients in each subgroup limited our ability to differentiate between them. Interferon alfa induced complete hematologic remission in five of 14 patients; four of these remissions lasted more than 5 years. Only one of 26 patients developed blast crisis. The median survival of the 26 patients was 37 months. CONCLUSION: Patients with M-bcr rearrangement-negative CML fall into three morphologic subgroups. Disease evolution does not generally involve blastic transformation. Instead, patients show progressive organomegaly, leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis. Some patients in each subgroup can respond to interferon alfa.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Bueso-Ramos, C E', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Freireich, E', 'Tucker, S L', 'Siciliano, M', 'Pilat, S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Kantarjian H', 'Freireich E', 'Tucker SL', 'Siciliano M', 'Pilat S', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Thrombocytosis/etiology']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.11.2915 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jun 1;19(11):2915-26. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.11.2915.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1991 and December 1996, we administered the nucleoside analog 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) to 73 children with primary AML and 20 children with secondary AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients received one or two 5-day courses of 2-CDA (8.9 mg/m(2)/d) given by continuous infusion. All patients then received one to three courses of daunomycin, cytarabine, and etoposide (DAV) remission induction therapy. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with primary AML were assessable for response. Their rate of complete remission (CR) was 24% after one course of 2-CDA, 40% after two courses of 2-CDA, and 78% after DAV therapy. Of the 57 patients who entered CR, 11 subsequently underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and 40 underwent autologous BMT. Twenty-nine patients remain in continuous CR after BMT. Two patients remain in CR after chemotherapy only. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) estimate was 40% (SE = 0.080%). Patients with French-American-British (FAB) M5 AML had a higher rate of CR after treatment with 2-CDA (45% after one course and 70.6% after two courses) than did others (P =.002). In contrast, no patient with FAB M7 AML (n = 10) entered CR after treatment with 2-CDA. Similarly, no patient with primary MDS (n = 6) responded to 2-CDA. Seven patients with secondary AML or MDS (n = 14) had a partial response to one course of 2-CDA. CONCLUSION: This agent was well tolerated, and its toxicity was acceptable. Future trials should examine the effectiveness of 2-CDA given in combination with other agents effective against AML.","['Krance, R A', 'Hurwitz, C A', 'Head, D R', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F G', 'Crews, K R', 'Srivastava, D K', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Roberts, W M', 'Tong, X', 'Blakley, R L', 'Ribeiro, R C']","['Krance RA', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Head DR', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Crews KR', 'Srivastava DK', 'Mahmoud H', 'Roberts WM', 'Tong X', 'Blakley RL', 'Ribeiro RC']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. rakrance@bcm.tmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.11.2804 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jun 1;19(11):2804-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.11.2804.,,,,"['P01-CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular events leading to these abnormalities are not fully understood. Previously we showed that Bcr-Abl elicits ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Abl interactor proteins. Because recent studies have suggested a role of Abl interactor proteins in the pathway that regulates cytoskeletal function, we investigated whether mutations in Bcr-Abl that interfere with the signaling to Abl interactor proteins affect its leukemogenic activity. We report here that the Src homology 3 domain and C-terminal proline-rich sequences of Bcr-Abl are required for its binding to Abl interactor 2 as well as for the induction of Abl interactor 2 degradation. Although the deletion of these regions did not affect the ability of the mutant Bcr-Abl to transform hematopoietic cells to growth factor independence, it abrogated its ability to stimulate spontaneous cell migration on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Furthermore, the mutant Bcr-Abl, defective in binding to Abl interactor 2 and inducing its degradation, failed to induce chronic myelogenous leukemia-like disease in mouse. These results are consistent with a role of Abl interactor proteins in the regulation of cytoskeletal function as well as in the pathogenesis of Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis.","['Dai, Z', 'Kerzic, P', 'Schroeder, W G', 'McNiece, I K']","['Dai Z', 'Kerzic P', 'Schroeder WG', 'McNiece IK']","['Experimental Hematology Laboratory, Bone Marrow Transplant Program, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80262, USA. zonghan.dai@uchsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABI2 protein, human)', '0 (Abi2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis', 'Fibronectins/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proline', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M101170200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)80354-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 3;276(31):28954-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M101170200.

The MAPK kinase MEK5 activates the MAPK ERK5. To investigate the potential involvement of MEK5-ERK5 in cardiac hypertrophy, we expressed constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of MEK5 in cardiomyocytes in vitro. MEK5 induced a form of hypertrophy in which cardiomyocytes acquired an elongated morphology and sarcomeres were assembled in a serial manner. The cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which stimulates MEK5 activity, evoked a similar response. Moreover, a dominant-negative MEK5 mutant specifically blocked LIF-induced elongation of cardiomyocytes and reduced expression of fetal cardiac genes without blocking other aspects of LIF-induced hypertrophy. Consistent with the ability of MEK5 to induce serial assembly of sarcomeres in vitro, cardiac-specific expression of activated MEK5 in transgenic mice resulted in eccentric cardiac hypertrophy that progressed to dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden death. These findings reveal a specific role for MEK5-ERK5 in the induction of eccentric cardiac hypertrophy and in transduction of cytokine signals that regulate serial sarcomere assembly.","['Nicol, R L', 'Frey, N', 'Pearson, G', 'Cobb, M', 'Richardson, J', 'Olson, E N']","['Nicol RL', 'Frey N', 'Pearson G', 'Cobb M', 'Richardson J', 'Olson EN']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 6000 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390-9148, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k5 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis', 'COS Cells', 'Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heart/*physiopathology', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 5', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology/*enzymology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sarcomeres/*physiology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/20.11.2757 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Jun 1;20(11):2757-67. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.11.2757.,PMC125475,,,"['R01 DK034128/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK034128/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK34128/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major component of this Ca2+ influx is store-dependent and often can be measured directly as the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (I(CRAC)). Under physiological conditions of weak intracellular Ca2+ buffering, respiring mitochondria play a central role in store-operated Ca2+ influx. They determine whether macroscopic I(CRAC) activates or not, to what extent and for how long. Here we describe an additional role for energized mitochondria: they reduce the amount of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) that is required to activate I(CRAC). By increasing the sensitivity of store-operated influx to InsP3, respiring mitochondria will determine whether modest levels of stimulation are capable of evoking Ca2+ entry or not. Mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering therefore increases the dynamic range of concentrations over which the InsP3 is able to function as the physiological messenger that triggers the activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx.","['Gilabert, J A', 'Bakowski, D', 'Parekh, A B']","['Gilabert JA', 'Bakowski D', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/physiology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/20.11.2672 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Jun 1;20(11):2672-9. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.11.2672.,PMC125482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One strategy for circumventing this difficulty would be to use vectors capable of replication within tumor tissues. We have developed a replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) vector derived from murine leukemia virus (MuLV). This vector utilizes a unique design strategy in which an internal ribosome entry site-transgene cassette is positioned between the env gene and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). The ability of this vector to replicate and transmit a transgene was examined in culture and in a solid tumor model in vivo. The RCR vector exhibited replication kinetics similar to those of wildtype MuLV and mediated efficient delivery of the transgene throughout an entire population of cells in culture after an initial inoculation with 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) of vector per 2000 cells. After injection of 6 x 10(3) PFU of vector into established subcutaneous tumors, highly efficient spread of the transgene was observed over a period of 7 weeks, in some cases resulting in spread of the transgene throughout the entire tumor. MuLV-based RCR vectors show significant advantages over standard replication-defective vectors in efficiency of gene delivery both in culture and in vivo. This represents the first example of the use of an RCR vector in an adult mammalian host, and their first application to transduction of solid tumors.","['Logg, C R', 'Tai, C K', 'Logg, A', 'Anderson, W F', 'Kasahara, N']","['Logg CR', 'Tai CK', 'Logg A', 'Anderson WF', 'Kasahara N']","['Department of Pathology and Institute for Genetic Medicine, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/therapy', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Virus Replication']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303401750195881 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 May 20;12(8):921-32. doi: 10.1089/104303401750195881.,PMC8184367,,,"['R01 CA085908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA85908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS1710112']

Such strategy is based upon multisubunit covalent immobilization of the enzyme onto activated supports (agarose-glutaraldehyde). Supports activated with different densities of reactive groups were used; the higher the density of groups, the higher the stabilization attained. However, because of the complexity of that enzyme, even the use of the highest densities of reactive groups was not enough to encompass all four subunits in the immobilization process. Therefore, a further chemical intersubunit cross-linking with aldehyde-dextran was pursued; these derivatives displayed a fully stabilized multimeric structure. In fact, boiling the modified enzyme derivative in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol did not lead to release of any enzyme subunit into the medium. Such a derivative, prepared under optimal conditions, retained ca. 40% of the intrinsic activity of the free enzyme and was also functionally stabilized, with thermostabilization enhancements of ca. 3 orders of magnitude when compared with its soluble counterpart. This type of derivative may be appropriate for extracorporeal devices in the clinical treatment of acute leukemia and might thus bring about inherent advantages in that all subunits are covalently bound to the support, with a longer half-life and a virtually nil risk of subunit release into the circulating blood stream.","['Balcao, V M', 'Mateo, C', 'Fernandez-Lafuente, R', 'Malcata, F X', 'Guisan, J M']","['Balcao VM', 'Mateo C', 'Fernandez-Lafuente R', 'Malcata FX', 'Guisan JM']","['Escola Superior de Biotecnologia, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida, P-4200-072 Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'T3C89M417N (Glutaral)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Biotechnology/*methods', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Enzymes, Immobilized/chemistry/metabolism', 'Glutaral/chemistry', 'Mercaptoethanol/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Sepharose/chemistry', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/chemistry']",2001/06/02 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/06/02 10:00'],"['2001/06/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['bp000163r [pii]', '10.1021/bp000163r [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2001 May-Jun;17(3):537-42. doi: 10.1021/bp000163r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the herein reported experiments was to investigate whether serotonin could regulate the proliferation of a human T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM cells) and to characterize the 5-HT receptor(s) involved in this phenomenon using a pharmacological approach. The herein presented results show that serotonin alone stimulated the proliferation of CCRF-CEM cells and that this effect could be mimicked by two 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists (L-694,247 and GR 46611). Serotonin- or L-694,247-induced increase in cell proliferation was inhibited by a selective 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, SB-224289. A recently identified endogenous tetrapeptide, 5-HT-moduline (Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu, LSAL), which specifically antagonizes 5-HT1B/1D receptor activity, was also shown to reverse the stimulating action of L-694,247 on T cell proliferation. Taken together, these results establish the existence of a direct serotonergic control of the T cell proliferation mediated through h5-HT1B receptors. In addition, these results are in favour of an immunomodulatory role of 5-HT-moduline.","['Sibella-Arguelles, C']",['Sibella-Arguelles C'],"['Unite de pharmacologie neuro-immuno-endocrinienne, departement de physiopathologie, Institut Pasteur, 28, rue du Dr-Roux, 75724 Paris, France. mhj@pasteur.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,C R Acad Sci III,"Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.

In a paracrine mode of action, TRAIL killed NB4 as well as heterologous and retinoic-acid-resistant cells. In the leukemic blasts of freshly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, retinoic-acid-induced expression of TRAIL most likely caused blast apoptosis.

T-cell monoclonality in these lesions is considered by some to be an important prognostic factor of neoplastic evolution, whereas others claim that clonality can also be found in benign skin infiltrates and is therefore of limited diagnostic value. To address this controversy, the authors analyzed retrospectively eight patients with lymphocytic skin lesions who progressed to CTCL, and three patients with recurrent T-cell lymphocytic infiltrates who had not developed CTCL. From a total of 65 biopsies of eight progressing patients, 32 were diagnosed as histologically malignant and 33 were diagnosed as benign or borderline. The authors found clonality by either polymerase chain reaction or Southern blot analysis in 88% of malignant and in 79% of nonmalignant lesions. None of the 37 biopsies of non-progressing patients was clonal. These results indicate strongly that the presence of monoclonality in T-cell skin infiltrates is related closely to the risk of developing CTCL. The value of clonality as a marker of malignancy is supported by the absence of T-cell clonal populations in all infiltrates from patients who had not progressed to lymphoma.","['Dadej, K', 'Gaboury, L', 'Lamarre, L', 'Petorin, C', 'Seguin, C', 'Cadotte, M', 'Gorska-Flipot, I']","['Dadej K', 'Gaboury L', 'Lamarre L', 'Petorin C', 'Seguin C', 'Cadotte M', 'Gorska-Flipot I']","[""Laboratory of Oncopathology, Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precancerous Conditions/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",2001/06/01 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-200106000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2001 Jun;10(2):78-88. doi: 10.1097/00019606-200106000-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The M-MuLV long terminal repeats (LTRs) contain tandemly repeated transcriptional enhancer sequences consisting of smaller motifs that bind cellular DNA-binding proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation. The M-MuLV enhancers are also important for disease specificity and latency of disease induction. To enrich for proviral chromatin containing M-MuLV LTR sequences, an affinity purification scheme was employed that relies on the affinity of bacterial Lac repressor protein for Lac operator (LacO) DNA sequences. An infectious M-MuLV recombinant was constructed that contains bacterial LacO sequences inserted into a nonessential region downstream from the 5' LTR of the virus (M-MuLV-LacO). Nuclei from M-MuLV-LacO-infected cells were digested with PvuII (which will liberate an LTR fragment containing LacO sequences), and digested chromatin was leached from the nuclei in hypotonic buffer. M-MuLV-LacO chromatin was then recovered by binding to an affinity matrix consisting of a beta-galactosidase-Lac repressor fusion protein anchored to acrylamide beads by an anti-beta-galactosidase monoclonal antibody [7]. Specifically bound chromatin was eluted under physiological conditions by incubation with the galactose analog isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside.

Here, we analyze the optimal steps to fully describe this kinase in both normal neutrophils and leukemic cell lines. These are: (i) immunological analyses (immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation); (ii) enzyme activity assays (in vitro and ""in-gel""); and (iii) immunobiochemical combination methods (immunoprecipitation/kinase assay, immunoprecipitation/""in-gel"" assay and ion exchange chromatography/immunoblotting). For the enzyme assays, we describe a novel method to measure ribosomal p90rsk kinase activity ""in-gel"", based on a renatured-protein method that allows for the direct quantitation of enzyme activity. Finally, we present an algorithm that can be readily implemented to the quantification of the extent of stimulation of a kinase in response to a particular extracellular stimuli. In our case, it was found that activation of p90rsk was higher in proliferating leukemic cells than in mature neutrophils, indicating that a suppression of key signal transduction links could contribute to the maturational arrest typical of acute leukemia. All the techniques and strategies described here for p90rsk could be easily extrapolated to the study of any signal transduction molecule, provided it has a phosphotransferase activity.","['Sampt, E R', 'Fernandez, G A', 'Lehman, J A', 'Corey, S J', 'Huang, C K', 'Gomez-Cambronero, J']","['Sampt ER', 'Fernandez GA', 'Lehman JA', 'Corey SJ', 'Huang CK', 'Gomez-Cambronero J']","['Department of Physiology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT 06030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Biochem Biophys Methods,Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods,7907378,['EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biochemistry/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/*chemistry', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2001/06/01 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165022X01001361 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-022x(01)00136-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem Biophys Methods. 2001 May 28;48(3):219-37. doi: 10.1016/s0165-022x(01)00136-1.,,,,['HL056653/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To perform this function, NK cells utilize two main cytotoxicity pathways, the well known perforin/granzyme-mediated secretory/necrotic killing and the recently defined TNF family ligand-mediated non-secretory/apoptotic killing. The former mechanism is manifested mainly against a few cultured leukemia cell targets, while the latter mediates killing against a large variety of tumor cell targets. Therefore, the biological role and significance of these mechanisms might be different. The NK cell-mediated necrotic killing has been reliably and selectively measured in humans by the standard 4-h 51Cr release assay (CRA) against K562 myeloid leukemia cell targets. However, no standardized high throughput assay is available for testing the NK cell-mediated apoptotic killing. Here, we introduce the modified MCA as a convenient method for measuring perforin/granzyme-independent NK cell-mediated apoptotic killing. The assay is performed in microwells of Terasaki tissue culture microtest plates, using adherent tumor cell targets, which are selectively susceptible to non-secretory/apoptotic killing and resistant to secretory/necrotic killing mediated by NK cells. Target cells are plated in microwells and incubated overnight to adhere to the plastic surface and to regenerate cell surface-bound TNF family receptors. Following this adherence, target cells are co-incubated with freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMNL) or purified subpopulations of immune cells for 24 h in various effector/target (E/T) ratios. During this incubation, dead target cells become non-adherent and are removed by washing the wells. Remaining adherent (viable) target cells are fixed, stained and optically counted. A notable dose-dependent (peak at 200:1 E/T ratio), time-dependent (peak at 24 h of incubation) and donor-dependent killing of tumor cells was consistently and reproducibly induced by PBMNL of normal donors. Using purified subpopulations of immune cells, it was demonstrated that among PBMNL, CD3(-)CD56(+)CD16(+) mature NK cells are the only mediators of tumor cell killing in MCA, as well as in CRA. Comparative studies of NK activity detected by MCA and CRA, performed with PBMNL from normal individuals and breast cancer patients, showed no significant correlation between the cytotoxicities measured in the two assays. In addition, while NK activity measured in CRA was normal in most breast cancer patients, NK activity assessed in MCA was decreased in a large majority of the patients. Thus, MCA is a sensitive NK assay, which is biologically different from CRA, and may be clinically relevant. MCA has also a higher throughput, and is more practical and economical than CRA.","['Wahlberg, B J', 'Burholt, D R', 'Kornblith, P', 'Richards, T J', 'Bruffsky, A', 'Herberman, R B', 'Vujanovic, N L']","['Wahlberg BJ', 'Burholt DR', 'Kornblith P', 'Richards TJ', 'Bruffsky A', 'Herberman RB', 'Vujanovic NL']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 15213, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Necrosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/01 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022175901003611 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00361-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2001 Jul 1;253(1-2):69-81. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00361-1.,,,,"['1-P60 DE13059-01/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional techniques using chromium release assays to measure lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity suffer from disadvantages, including radioactive contamination and the inability to simultaneously determine K-562 and/or CD56+ lymphocyte phenotypes. We illustrate here a three-color flow cytometric method providing for the simultaneous evaluation of K-562-CD56+ LGL binding, K-562 cell viability, and the status of K-562 cell differentiation. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) engenders megakaryocytic differentiation in K-562 cell populations, as measured by presentation of the beta(3) integrin (gpIIIa, CD61), while maintaining a negative expression of MHC-I and MHC-II molecules. Using the auto-fluorescence of K-562 cells, flow cytometry can be used to demonstrate a significant decrease in CD56+ LGL activity against K-562 cells in populations pre-incubated with PMA. The capacity of three-color flow cytometry to measure lymphocyte-target cell binding and cell death kinetics, while simultaneously determining target cell phenotype, permits the specific localization of CD61-expressing K-562 cells to areas inconsistent with CD56+ LGL-mediated patterns of lysis.","['Baker, E J', 'Ichiki, A T', 'Day, N E', 'Andrews, R B', 'Bamberger, E G', 'Lozzio, C B']","['Baker EJ', 'Ichiki AT', 'Day NE', 'Andrews RB', 'Bamberger EG', 'Lozzio CB']","['Department of Medical Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tennessee Medical Center at Knoxville, 1924 Alcoa Highway, 37920, Knoxville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Color', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Megakaryocytes/*immunology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2001/06/01 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022175901003738 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00373-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2001 Jul 1;253(1-2):37-44. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00373-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results were expressed as percent of positive B cells and as median fluorescence intensity, an indirect assessment of the expression level. RESULTS: CD20, CD22, CD24, CD40, CD79a, CD79b, FMC7, CD11a, CD18, CD44 were positive in the whole B cell population, whereas CD10, CD86, CD103, CD154 and FasL were almost absent from the B-lymphocyte population. 75% were IgD positive.

The syntheses of the analogues were accomplished by reductive amination of the appropriate anilines with 2-amino-4-oxo-5-cyanopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (28) followed by saponification of the ethyl esters, for the classical analogue 6. The N9-methyl analogues were obtained from the N9-H precursors by reductive methylation. In general, the nonclassical compounds 7-17 were similar in potency to TMP against Toxoplasma gondii DHFR, with selectivity ratios greater than 38 and 21 for 11 and 16, respectively. These compounds were poor inhibitors of Pneumocystis carinii DHFR and rat liver DHFR. The nonclassical analogues were also inactive against TS. The classical analogue 6 was a marginal inhibitor of isolated human TS (IC50 = 46 microM) and of human DHFR (IC50 = 10 microM), however, it was a potent inhibitor of the growth of two human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and of CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells in culture and was similar to LY231514 against ZR-75-1 human breast carcinoma cell line. Evaluation of 6 against MTX-resistant sublines indicated that DHFR is not the major target of 6. Metabolite protection studies of the growth inhibitory activity of 6 suggest that TS is a major target of this drug and that polyglutamyl forms of 6 may serve as the intracellular TS inhibitors. These studies also suggest that 6 has a site of action in addition to sites in the folate pathway.","['Gangjee, A', 'Vidwans, A', 'Elzein, E', 'McGuire, J J', 'Queener, S F', 'Kisliuk, R L']","['Gangjee A', 'Vidwans A', 'Elzein E', 'McGuire JJ', 'Queener SF', 'Kisliuk RL']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. gangjee@duq.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Glutamates/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Pemetrexed', 'Pneumocystis/enzymology', 'Pyrimidines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Toxoplasma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/06/01 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['jm0100382 [pii]', '10.1021/jm0100382 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 Jun 7;44(12):1993-2003. doi: 10.1021/jm0100382.,,,,"['AI41743/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI44661/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10914/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow cells of 13 children with untreated ALL (nine common ALL, two myeloid antigen positive ALL and two early T-cell ALL) formed colonies of leukemic blast cells in primary methylcellulose cultures. Spontaneous growth was observed in three of 13 cases, whereas phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte conditioned medium (PHA-LCM), a conventional source of various natural human cytokines, induced colony formation in ten of 13 cases. A similar rate of responsiveness was seen with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF); a combination of these three cytokines induced colony formation in all cases studied. The effect of these growth factors on colony formation seemed to be dose-dependent in some cases. Of the stimuli studied, GM-CSF induced the smallest number of colonies, whereas the effects of G-CSF, SCF and PHA-LCM were similar in this respect. Combination of cytokines proved to be even more efficient in inducing clonal proliferation of leukemic lymphoblasts. In double combinations, G-CSF and GM-CSF as well as G-CSF and SCF were able to potentiate each other's effects. Triple combination of these cytokines mediated the most potent growth stimulus. Our results demonstrate that myeloid and pleiotropic cytokines are able to stimulate clonal proliferation of pediatric leukemic lymphoblasts. This may present a potential hazard to children with ALL while on adjuvant therapy with hematopoietic growth factors. In vitro colony assays performed prior to or in parallel with the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to ALL patients may help to forecast their possible effects on leukemic cells in vivo.","['Benko, I', 'Kovacs, P', 'Szegedi, I', 'Megyeri, A', 'Kiss, A', 'Balogh, E', 'Olah, E', 'Kappelmayer, J', 'Kiss, C']","['Benko I', 'Kovacs P', 'Szegedi I', 'Megyeri A', 'Kiss A', 'Balogh E', 'Olah E', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Kiss C']","['Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary. benko@king.pharmacol.dote.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (myelopoietin)', '134034-50-7 (pleiotrophin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-3', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2001/06/01 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002100000390 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2001 May;363(5):499-508. doi: 10.1007/s002100000390.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of lymphoid/myeloid malignancy among hospitalized CD patients. This is a retrospective cohort study using hospital discharge data from California and Virginia. Cohorts were defined by the presence or absence of a CD diagnosis in all patients discharged during a single calendar year (Year-2). The presence or absence of lymphoid/myeloid malignancy was determined for all hospitalizations during a 4-year period (Year-1 to Year-4) for each member of both cohorts. To obtain a 2-year cumulative incidence rate, patients with lymphoid/myeloid malignancy prior to or at the time of their first admission in Year-2 were excluded. Patients were followed for 8 quarters after this admission for the incidence of lymphoid/myeloid malignancy. Cumulative incidence rates and odds ratios were calculated. The crude 2-year incidence rate of lymphoid/myeloid malignancy among hospitalized CD patients was 3.87/1.000 CD patients (21/5,426; 95% CI = 2.40-5.92). The odds ratio adjusted for age, gender, and race was 2.04 (95% CI = 1.33-3.14, p < 0.001). The 2-year cumulative incidence of lymphoid/myeloid malignancies among hospitalized CD patients is greater than that seen in hospitalized patients without CD. This finding supports the need for further prospective population-based studies.","['Arseneau, K O', 'Stukenborg, G J', 'Connors, A F Jr', 'Cominelli, F']","['Arseneau KO', 'Stukenborg GJ', 'Connors AF Jr', 'Cominelli F']","['Digestive Health Center, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Inflamm Bowel Dis,Inflammatory bowel diseases,9508162,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Cohort Studies', 'Crohn Disease/*complications/epidemiology', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/06/01 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/06/01 10:00'],"['2001/06/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00054725-200105000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2001 May;7(2):106-12. doi: 10.1097/00054725-200105000-00005.,,,,['454740/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various hypotheses were advanced in the preliminary stages of the clinical development of such molecular target agents: ""They only prevent cancer cell proliferation and have no killer cell activity; they are extremely weak, and can not be expected to reduce tumors at the clinical level. ""Or:"" A long time is required before their physiological activity will be expressed in an antitumor effect."" However, with non-small cell lung cancer, the most difficult tumor among solid cancers for an anticancer agent to be effective, not only was ZD1839 effective, but showed clear effectiveness in combination chemotherapy in the pretreatment stage. Moreover, the time for the expression of its tumor reduction effect was virtually the same as with conventional anticancer drugs, and its effectiveness proved to last longer after its initial expression.

We compared the phosphorylation/activation of signal tranducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38(MAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The phosphorylation of STAT3 by IL-1 beta was delayed (>60 min), whereas the response to LIF was rapid (<10 min) and transient. We confirmed that IL-1 beta potently stimulated all three MAPK subfamilies. In contrast, LIF promoted strong activation of ERKs, marginal activation of p38(MAPK), and no c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. To test the roles of ERKs and p38(MAPK), myocytes were pretreated with PD98059 and SB203580. Either inhibitor alone prevented STAT3 phosphorylation, implicating ERKs and p38(MAPK) in the delayed STAT3 response to IL-1 beta. The interplay of MAPKs and STAT3 phosphorylation in regulating IL-1 beta-stimulated hypertrophy was investigated by evaluating the effect of MAPK inhibitors on atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression and myocyte morphology. The specific inhibition of either ERK or p38(MAPK) attenuated the IL-1 beta- or LIF-stimulated ANF expression by up to 70%. Inhibition was not further increased in the presence of both inhibitors. Furthermore, although individual inhibition of ERK or p38(MAPK) did not affect morphology, co-treatment with both inhibitors abrogated the hypertrophic morphology stimulated by IL-1 beta but not by LIF. Taken together, our data indicate that the activation of ERK and p38(MAPK) is essential in regulating a delayed STAT3 phosphorylation as well as changes in ANF expression and morphology that follow IL-1 beta treatment. Thus, the role of MAPKs in the hypertrophic response can be dictated at least partly by the nature of the hypertrophic agent employed.","['Ng, D C', 'Long, C S', 'Bogoyevitch, M A']","['Ng DC', 'Long CS', 'Bogoyevitch MA']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Western Australia, Crawley 6009, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heart/drug effects/physiology', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Hypertrophy', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M100699200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)80422-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 3;276(31):29490-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M100699200.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 62 consecutive cases of childhood leukemias referred to the Department of Pathology, Aga Khan University Hospital, (AKUH) between January 1995 and December 1998 was analyzed using Epi Info Version 6. Flow cytometry on all samples was performed using standard protocols. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 8.2 years and 49 (79%) were males. Fifty (81%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemias of which 50% were CD10 positive and 24% CD10 negative Pre-B cell leukemias. Among all Pre B cell All 98% were positive for CD19, 96% for CD22, 89% for HLA-DR and 67% for CD10. Of the 10 AML cases, 100% were positive for CD33, 90% for CD13, 80% for CD19 and 70% for HLA-DR. CONCLUSION: The mean age in this study population was significantly higher and percentage of CD10 positive Pre-B All is lower than that in the West. Both these factors might be responsible for the poorer prognosis of these patients. It is not possible to specify a minimum or maximum panel of antibodies that should be used for phenotyping all cases of childhood leukemias. A certain degree or redundancy is essential in any panel of antibodies used for flow cytometry of leukemias.","['Yusuf, R Z', 'Pervez, S', 'Aziz, S A', 'Khurshid, M']","['Yusuf RZ', 'Pervez S', 'Aziz SA', 'Khurshid M']","['Department of Pathology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

Staining results revealed expression of bcl-x(L), CD68R, and tryptase in neoplastic MCs (focal dense infiltrates) in all patients. Mastocytosis infiltrates were also immunoreactive for CD45, CD117 (Kit), and HLA-DR. In most cases, the CD2 antibody produced reactivity with bm MCs in mastocytosis, whereas in control cases (reactive bm, immunocytoma, myelodysplastic syndrome), MCs were consistently CD2 negative. Expression of bcl-2 was detectable in a subset of MCs in the patient with MCL, whereas no reactivity was seen in patients with SIM or bm mastocytosis. Mastocytosis infiltrates did not react with antibodies against CD15, CD30, CD31, CD34, or MPO. In summary, our data confirm the diagnostic value of staining for tryptase, Kit, and CD68R in mastocytosis. Apart from these, CD2 may be a novel useful marker because MCs in mastocytosis frequently express this antigen, whereas MCs in other pathologic conditions are CD2 negative.","['Jordan, J H', 'Walchshofer, S', 'Jurecka, W', 'Mosberger, I', 'Sperr, W R', 'Wolff, K', 'Chott, A', 'Buhring, H J', 'Lechner, K', 'Horny, H P', 'Valent, P']","['Jordan JH', 'Walchshofer S', 'Jurecka W', 'Mosberger I', 'Sperr WR', 'Wolff K', 'Chott A', 'Buhring HJ', 'Lechner K', 'Horny HP', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'CD2 Antigens/*analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*chemistry', 'Mastocytosis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis', 'Tryptases', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(01)51875-4 [pii]', '10.1053/hupa.2001.24319 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2001 May;32(5):545-52. doi: 10.1053/hupa.2001.24319.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While very low levels of cyclin A1 have been reported in the human hematopoietic system and brain, the sites of elevated levels of expression of human cyclin A1 were several leukemia cell lines and blood samples from patients with hematopoietic malignances, notably acute myeloid leukemia. To evaluate whether cyclin A1 is directly involved with the development of myeloid leukemia, mouse cyclin A1 protein was overexpressed in the myeloid lineage of transgenic mice under the direction of the human cathepsin G (hCG) promoter. The resulting transgenic mice exhibited an increased proportion of immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. The abnormal myelopoiesis developed within the first few months after birth and progressed to overt acute myeloid leukemia at a low frequency ( approximately 15%) over the course of 7-14 months. Both the abnormalities in myelopoiesis and the leukemic state could be transplanted to irradiated SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mice. The observations suggest that cyclin A1 overexpression results in abnormal myelopoiesis and is necessary, but not sufficient in the cooperative events inducing the transformed phenotype. The data further support an important role of cyclin A1 in hematopoiesis and the etiology of myeloid leukemia.","['Liao, C', 'Wang, X Y', 'Wei, H Q', 'Li, S Q', 'Merghoub, T', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Wolgemuth, D J']","['Liao C', 'Wang XY', 'Wei HQ', 'Li SQ', 'Merghoub T', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Wolgemuth DJ']","['Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccna1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin A/*physiology', 'Cyclin A1', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', '*Leukopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.121540098 [doi]', '121540098 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jun 5;98(12):6853-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.121540098.

Several enhancers have been identified within the murine SCL locus that direct reporter gene expression to subdomains of the normal SCL expression pattern, and long-range sequence comparisons of the human and murine SCL loci have identified additional candidate enhancers. To facilitate the characterization of regulatory elements, we have sequenced and analyzed 33 kb of the SCL genomic locus from the pufferfish Fugu rubripes, a species with a highly compact genome. Although the pattern of SCL expression is highly conserved from mammals to teleost fish, the genes flanking pufferfish SCL were unrelated to those known to flank both avian and mammalian SCL genes. These data suggest that SCL regulatory elements are confined to the region between the upstream and downstream flanking genes, a region of 65 kb in human and 8.5 kb in pufferfish. Consistent with this hypothesis, the entire 33-kb pufferfish SCL locus directed appropriate expression to hemopoietic and neural tissue in transgenic zebrafish embryos, as did a 10.4-kb fragment containing the SCL gene and extending to the 5' and 3' flanking genes. These results demonstrate the power of combining the compact genome of the pufferfish with the advantages that zebrafish provide for studies of gene regulation during development. Furthermore, the pufferfish SCL locus provides a powerful tool for the manipulation of hemopoiesis and vasculogenesis in vivo.","['Barton, L M', 'Gottgens, B', 'Gering, M', 'Gilbert, J G', 'Grafham, D', 'Rogers, J', 'Bentley, D', 'Patient, R', 'Green, A R']","['Barton LM', 'Gottgens B', 'Gering M', 'Gilbert JG', 'Grafham D', 'Rogers J', 'Bentley D', 'Patient R', 'Green AR']","['Department of Hematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge CB2 2XY, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fishes/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Zebrafish/*genetics', '*Zebrafish Proteins']",2001/06/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/06/08 10:00'],"['2001/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.101532998 [doi]', '101532998 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jun 5;98(12):6747-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.101532998.

We applied the Fas/anti-Fas system to induce killing of Fas-expressing immunocytes with resultant immunosuppression. W7TM-1 tumour cells, a rat T-cell line, were inoculated subcutaneously in BALB/c mice and tumour growth was monitored in untreated mice and in mice treated with RMF2. Prior to treatment with RMF2, we examined the expression of Fas in isolated splenocytes and in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. There was a remarkable increase in Fas-positive lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells, among splenocytes at day 5 after tumour cell inoculation. The number of Fas-positive infiltrating lymphocytes also increased markedly, from day 5 to day 10. We then examined whether RMF2 could induce apoptosis of Fas-positive activated lymphocytes isolated from the spleen at day 5 in vitro. Terminal deoxy (d) -UTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) and Annexin V staining methods showed apoptosis of isolated cells when incubated with RMF2, and typical apoptotic features were confirmed by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining. Furthermore, suppression of cellular and humoral immunity was noted in RMF2-treated mice by mixed lymphocyte reaction and assay of serum levels of immunoglobulin G, respectively. Finally, treatment of animals with RMF2 daily from day 5 to day 9 could maintain the tumour size, while the tumour mass began to diminish in untreated mice immediately after reaching a maximum size. We confirmed the enhancing effects of long-term treatment with RMF2, through the induction of immunosuppression, on the growth of unvascularized xenogeneic tumour cell grafts.","['Sawada, T', 'Koji, T', 'Hishikawa, Y', 'Kishimoto, K', 'Nagayasu, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Oka, T', 'Ayabe, H']","['Sawada T', 'Koji T', 'Hishikawa Y', 'Kishimoto K', 'Nagayasu T', 'Takahashi T', 'Oka T', 'Ayabe H']","['The First Department of Surgery, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan. sawayan@mocha.ocn.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Graft Survival/*immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*immunology/metabolism']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['imm1223 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.2001.01223.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2001 May;103(1):81-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.2001.01223.x.,PMC1783211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AN-9, a butyric acid (BA) derivative, is a potent differentiating and an anti-cancer drug that induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Herein we show the affect of AN-9, alone and in combination with doxorubicin, on cell cultures from B-CLL patients. Cells from 17 patients were cultured and tested for viability, apoptosis, bcl-2 and bax protein expression. Exposure of B-CLL cell cultures to AN-9 was accompanied by apoptosis and a marked viability loss (up to 46%, p=0.0017). AN-9 reduced up to 51% (p=0.0017) the levels of bcl-2 in 57% of the cultures that express bcl-2. The combination of low concentrations of AN-9 and doxorubicin more than additively enhanced apoptosis and reduced bcl-2 levels in B-CLL cultures which were resistant to AN-9. AN-9 enhanced bax expression up to 58%(p=0.008) in cultures from 53% of the patients, but had no effect on bax levels when combined with doxorubicin. In conclusion, AN-9 alone reduced bcl-2 and enhanced bax expression in cultures from B-CLL patients, and the reduction of bcl-2 levels in combination with doxorubicin was greater than additive. These results may be beneficial in possible future combination therapy with AN-9 in B-CLL.","['Rabizadeh, E', 'Bairey, O', 'Aviram, A', 'Ben-Dror, I', 'Shaklai, M', 'Zimra, Y']","['Rabizadeh E', 'Bairey O', 'Aviram A', 'Ben-Dror I', 'Shaklai M', 'Zimra Y']","['Institute of Hematology and Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Rabin Medical Center, Belinson Campus, Petach Tikva and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '122110-53-6 (pivalyloxymethyl butyrate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh364 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066004263.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Apr;66(4):263-71. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066004263.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we have examined IL-6-related cytokines in chronic CHF in humans by analysing gene and protein expression in myocardium derived from patients with end-stage heart failure and donor hearts. METHODS: Gene expression of cytokines/receptors of the IL-6 family was documented in myocardial samples using cDNA array hybridization and RNase protection assays. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-6 and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) in myocardial tissues. RESULTS: Myocardial gene activity was documented for the majority of IL-6 family cytokines and their receptors. Immunohistochemical analysis localized IL-6, LIF and their common receptor subunit gp130 to myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. LIF mRNA levels were enhanced in the left ventricles of CHF patients relative to the left ventricles of donor hearts (patients 4.6 +/- 4.7 vs. donors 0.3 +/- 0.3, P < 0.005). Myocardial IL-6 and gp130 mRNA levels were not statistically different between patients and donors, but in contrast to LIF mRNA expression in heart explants, gp130 mRNA levels were significantly higher in left atrium compared with left ventricle in both patients and donors. CONCLUSIONS: Both mRNA and proteins of gp130 and its ligands IL-6 and LIF are expressed in both nonfailing and failing human myocardium. The elevated LIF mRNA levels in left ventricles from patients with end-stage heart failure suggest a role for LIF in the pathogenesis of CHF.","['Eiken, H G', 'Oie, E', 'Damas, J K', 'Yndestad, A', 'Bjerkeli, V', 'Aass, H', 'Simonsen, S', 'Geiran, O R', 'Tonnessen, T', 'Christensen, G', 'Froland, S S', 'Gullestad, L', 'Attramadal, H', 'Aukrust, P']","['Eiken HG', 'Oie E', 'Damas JK', 'Yndestad A', 'Bjerkeli V', 'Aass H', 'Simonsen S', 'Geiran OR', 'Tonnessen T', 'Christensen G', 'Froland SS', 'Gullestad L', 'Attramadal H', 'Aukrust P']","['University of Oslo, The National Hospital, Ulleval Hospital Oslo, Norway. h.g.eiken@klinmed.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Heart Failure/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardium/chemistry/enzymology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['eci795 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2362.2001.00795.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2001 May;31(5):389-97. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2362.2001.00795.x.,,,,,,,,,['Eur J Clin Invest. 2001 May;31(5):378-9.

In order to obtain more insight into the clinical significance and regulation of IGFBP-4 in vivo we determined the levels of this protein by a specific radioimmunoassay in the human circulation under normal and various pathological conditions. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Selected human biological fluids and plasma samples from 804 normal healthy males and females, ranging from 0 to 78 years of age, were analysed. In addition, plasma samples from patients with several disorders (i.e. hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, GH-deficiency, acromegaly, cancer, chronic renal failure corticosteroid-treatment) were investigated. MEASUREMENTS: A specific RIA for hIGFBP-4 was developed, using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide containing amino acids 80-103 of the mature hIGFBP-4 sequence. RESULTS: In normal individuals circulating IGFBP-4 levels in males did not change with age. For females the values tended to increase slightly in older age. Overall, the mean +/- SD for males and females (189 +/- 83 microg/l and 193 +/- 72 microg/l, respectively) were not different. Normative range values of IGFBP-4 correlated weakly with those of IGF-II (r = 0.31, P < 0.001). Neither hypothyroidism nor hyperthyroidism appeared to influence circulating IGFBP-4 levels since the levels were within the normal range. Both GH status and pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids, as employed in various chronic diseases, did not seriously affect plasma IGFBP-4 either. Under conditions with increased circulating PTH levels, i.e. dialysed adult patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and subjects with hyperparathyroidism, a weak positive relationship was noted between the plasma contents of IGFBP-4 and PTH. An excess of IGFBP-4 was found in plasma of both nondialysed and dialysed prepubertal growth retarded children with chronic renal failure (CRF) (mean SDS: 10.75 and 5.78, respectively). IGFBP-4 levels were inversely related to glomerular filtration rate. Similar results were obtained for dialysed adults with CRF. In a group of CRF children who had undergone renal transplantation, circulating IGFBP-4 levels were markedly lower (mean SDS: 3.75). There was no evidence for an increased secretion of IGFBP-4 in the circulation of most of the cancer patients with solid tumours. Several children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, however, showed elevated plasma IGFBP-4 levels (mean SDS: 1.27). The presence of IGFBP-4 could also be demonstrated in other human biological fluids. The highest amounts were found in amniotic fluid (391-717 microg/l) and follicular fluid (249-500 microg/l). CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of plasma IGFBP-4 has been shown so far to be of minor clinical relevance. However, the results indicate that different concentration gradients between plasma and various other body fluids may exist. Therefore, it may well be that certain pathophysiological stimuli induce significant alterations in the local turnover rate of IGFBP-4 but that they are not reflected by changes in the circulating levels. The possibility of quantifying IGFBP-4 by RIA will facilitate further in vitro and in vivo studies on its regulation and function in humans.","['Van Doorn, J', 'Cornelissen, A J', 'Van Buul-Offers, S C']","['Van Doorn J', 'Cornelissen AJ', 'Van Buul-Offers SC']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Laboratory of Endocrinology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital/University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Absolute EBV-DNA levels at the time of EBV-LPD diagnosis did not predict for response, but the pattern of EBV-DNA levels within 72 h from the start of therapy (> 50% decrease versus increase) strongly predicted for clinical response (P = 0.001). Quantitative monitoring of EBV-DNA levels from the start of and during therapy for EBV-LPD rapidly and accurately predicts for response to therapy as early as within 72 h.

IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is the naturally occurring antagonist to IL-1alpha and -1beta. Polymorphisms of IL-1beta have been associated with variations in IL-1beta production (nucleotides +3953 and -511). A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the IL-1Ra gene has been associated (allele 2) with increased IL-1Ra production. We examined these polymorphisms in human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients and donors. IL-1Ra VNTR (allele 2) in the donor genotype was more frequent with milder acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) grades 0-II (29 out of 59 transplants) than severe GvHD grades III-IV (2 out of 18 transplants) (P = 0.0032). This association was confirmed in a subgroup with cyclosporine monotherapy prophylaxis: donor possession of allele 2 was again associated with milder aGvHD, grades 0-II (19 out of 38 transplants), than grades III-IV (1 out of 14) (P = 0.0042) transplants. No association was found between the IL-1beta -511 or IL-1beta +3953 polymorphism and severity of GvHD. Recipient IL-1Ra VNTR genotype (allele 2) showed a strong trend towards association with aGvHD severity (P = 0.0697).

Responses to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and zidovudine (AZT) have been documented but not with long-term follow-up. We treated 15 ATLL patients with IFN and AZT. Eleven patients had acute ATLL, two had lymphoma and two smouldering ATLL, with progression. The main features were: organomegaly (14), skin lesions (10), high white blood cell (WBC) count (11) and hypercalcaemia (9). Eleven patients had previously received chemotherapy and one had received an autograft. At the time of the study, seven patients had progressive disease and eight were in partial or complete clinical remission. Responses (PR) lasting 2+ to 44+ months were seen in 67%; 26% did not respond (NR) and one patient was not evaluable. Hypercalcaemia predicted a poor outcome but differences were not significant. Eight of the 15 patients have died 3-41 months from diagnosis. Median survival for the 15 patients was 18 months. Survival of the NR ranged from 4 to 20 months; six PR patients are alive 8-82 months from diagnosis. The differences in survival between NR (median: 6 months) and PR (55% of patients alive at 4 years) were statistically significant (P = 0.002). In conclusion, IFN and AZT improves the outcome of ATLL patients and helps maintain responses.","['Matutes, E', 'Taylor, G P', 'Cavenagh, J', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Bareford, D', 'Domingo, A', 'Hamblin, M', 'Kelsey, S', 'Mir, N', 'Reilly, J T']","['Matutes E', 'Taylor GP', 'Cavenagh J', 'Pagliuca A', 'Bareford D', 'Domingo A', 'Hamblin M', 'Kelsey S', 'Mir N', 'Reilly JT']","['Haematology Department of the Royal Marsden NHS Trust, London, UK. estella.icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2794 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02794.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jun;113(3):779-84. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02794.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gemcitabine 1 g/m(2) was administered as a 30-min infusion on d 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-d schedule, up to a maximum of six cycles. Complete responses were observed in two patients with MCL, and partial responses were observed in seven patients, including three patients with CLL/lymphocytic lymphoma, two patients with T-cell lymphoma, one patient with MCL and one patient with follicular lymphoma. Minor responses were observed in three patients, including two patients with MCL and one patient with CLL. The median duration of response was 150 d and the overall progression-free survival was 342 d. Haematological toxicity was observed as grade 3-4 leucopenia in 12 patients (33%) and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in 18 patients (50%). Severe non-haematological toxicity included one case of fatal veno-occlusive disease, one case of thrombotic microangiopathy leading to terminal renal failure, one case of capillary leak syndrome, one case of myocardial infarction and drug-induced fever in two patients. These data suggest that gemcitabine displays activity in patients with MCL and CLL/lymphocytic lymphoma. Haematological toxicity was frequent in these heavily treated patients.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treatment was started and remission was achieved after one course of chemotherapy; the AML treatment was continued for 6 months. Two months after cessation of chemotherapy, the patient developed a bone marrow relapse, this time with an undifferentiated blast morphology and a precursor B immunophenotype. Molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes showed several clonal gene rearrangements at diagnosis: two IGH, two IGK and two TCRD gene rearrangements. All rearrangements were also detected during the AML phase of the disease, suggesting a phenotypic shift of the same leukaemia. At relapse, 8 months later, all rearrangements were preserved except for one TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3) rearrangement. The first phenotypic shift in the genotypically stable leukaemia was remarkably fast. The most probable explanation for our observations is an oncogenic event in an undifferentiated haematopoietic progenitor clone, with a highly versatile phenotype.","['Bierings, M', 'Szczepanski, T', 'van Wering, E R', 'Willemse, M J', 'Langerak, A W', 'Revesz, T', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Bierings M', 'Szczepanski T', 'van Wering ER', 'Willemse MJ', 'Langerak AW', 'Revesz T', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Centre, Het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis, Utrecht, The Netherlands. m.bierings@wkz.azu.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2001/06/19 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2772 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02772.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jun;113(3):757-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02772.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seq ADE, based on the concept of Timed Sequential Therapy, comprised the same drugs as Std ADE but given at higher doses and in a different sequence. Between 1992 and 1997, 235 patients with relapsed (175) and refractory (60) AML were entered: 170 were randomized between Std versus Seq ADE and 213 between CSA versus no CSA.

This compound inhibits ribonucleotide reductase as does hydroxyurea, the first therapeutic agent used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Using the human erythroleukaemic K562 cell line as an in vitro model, we show here that 50 micromol/l of resveratrol induced a higher haemoglobin production (sevenfold) in K562 cells than 500 micromol/l of hydroxyurea (3.5-fold). This erythroid differentiation was linked to a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation associated with an equivalent increased expression of p21 mRNA, but with a higher increased level of p21 protein (sixfold) for cells treated with resveratrol than for those treated with hydroxyurea (1.5-fold). We also show that 50 micromol/l of resveratrol and 25 micromol/l of hydroxyurea induced variable but similar enhancements of fetal haemoglobin synthesis in cultured erythroid progenitors for the majority of the sickle cell patients studied. These inductions were linked to, but not correlated with, a variable decrease in erythroid burst-forming unit clone number.

Autologous tumour-specific T cells for adoptive T-cell transfer were propagated in vitro by repetitive stimulation with autologous ex vivo CD40-activated PCL cells.

Autologous T cells (5 x 108 and 2.5 x 109 for two separate treatment cycles) generated ex vivo and cytotoxic against autologous tumours were infused and well tolerated by the patient. Fever and myalgias were closely related to IL-2 injections and no other adverse effects were observed. A temporary decrease of PCL cells in peripheral blood was seen after the first cycle of adoptive T-cell therapy, tumour cell vaccination and low-dose IL-2.

The present study was conducted to determine whether anticipation occurs in familial chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Fourteen published reports of multigenerational familial CLL were analysed for anticipation, together with 10 previously unreported families with familial CLL, and the difference in disease-free survival between generations was determined. The difference between age at onset for each affected parent-child pair was tested against the null hypothesis that there was no difference in age at onset. The age at onset of the studied cases was also compared with that of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute. The median ages at onset in the child and parent generations of all families (51.0 and 72.0 years respectively) were significantly different (P < 0.000001), and the null hypothesis was rejected (P < 0.000001). A significant difference was observed between the ages of onset of the child generation and the SEER population (P < 0.00001), but not between the parent generation and the SEER population. Anticipation characterizes familial CLL.","['Wiernik, P H', 'Ashwin, M', 'Hu, X P', 'Paietta, E', 'Brown, K']","['Wiernik PH', 'Ashwin M', 'Hu XP', 'Paietta E', 'Brown K']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, New York Medical College, Bronx, NY 10466, USA. wiernik@jimmy.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Aged', '*Anticipation, Genetic', '*Databases, Factual', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', '*SEER Program', 'Survival Rate']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2773 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02773.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 May;113(2):407-14. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02773.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been shown to upregulate the expression of Bcl-2 in B-CLL cell lines. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to enhance the survival of endothelial cells by upregulating the expression of Bcl-2. In the present study, we measured serum and cellular levels of bFGF and VEGF in 85 patients with CLL using a commercial quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. Levels of Bcl-2 were also assayed concomitantly using Western blot analysis. The mean serum level of bFGF was 53.4 pg/ml (range 0-589) and that of VEGF 459.2 pg/ml (range 33-1793). The mean cellular level of bFGF was 158.3 pg/2 x 105 cells (range 0.8-841) and VEGF, 42.4 pg/2 x 105 cells (range 0-244). A high correlation was found between serum and cellular bFGF levels (P < 0.001), but not between the corresponding VEGF levels. Twenty-nine of 69 patients (42%) evaluated for Bcl-2 level, expressed it. The Bcl-2 level was positively correlated with the serum bFGF level (P = 0.007). However, surprisingly there was a negative correlation between Bcl-2 expression and intracellular VEGF level (P = 0.003). A positive correlation was also found between serum bFGF and disease follow-up time and log white blood cell count. These findings indicate that in CLL there is a correlation between angiogenesis-related factors and apoptosis-related protein expression, and elevated bFGF levels may account for the elevated Bcl-2 levels.","['Bairey, O', 'Zimra, Y', 'Shaklai, M', 'Rabizadeh, E']","['Bairey O', 'Zimra Y', 'Shaklai M', 'Rabizadeh E']","['Institute of Haematology and the Felsenstein Medical Research Centre, Rabin Medical Centre, Beilinson Campus, Petah Tikva, Israel. obairey@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/analysis/*blood/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/analysis/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2731 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02731.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 May;113(2):400-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02731.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the susceptibility of leukaemic cells taken from 75 CLL patients with either stable (STD) or progressive disease (PRD) to enter apoptosis. Particular attention was paid to the relationship between cell cycle status and autologous serum (AS). The susceptibility to enter apoptosis was significantly greater in STD than in PRD, both in standard medium (mean = 23.62% +/- 14.7 versus 14.23% +/- 7.2; P = 0.02) and in the presence of AS (mean = 23.03% +/- 17.9 versus 11.27% +/- 7.6; P = 0.01). Furthermore, cell kinetics studies revealed a higher quiescence in PRD than in STD cases, both in terms of a lower RNA content (P = 0.04) and of higher expression of the negative cell cycle regulator p27kip1 (P = 0.03). These kinetic differences were confirmed by short-term in vitro culture both in fetal calf serum and in AS. The results of this study indicate that CLL cells from PRD cases are characterized by a higher degree quiescence and much lower susceptibility to apoptosis when compared with STD ones. In this context, AS does not appear to play a specific role. The association between these kinetic characteristics and disease progression in CLL prompts further studies to establish whether higher quiescence may be responsible for the decreased susceptibility of PRD cells to enter apoptosis.","['Ricciardi, M R', 'Petrucci, M T', 'Gregorj, C', 'Ariola, C', 'Lemoli, R M', 'Fogli, M', 'Mauro, F R', 'Cerretti, R', 'Foa, R', 'Mandelli, F', 'Tafuri, A']","['Ricciardi MR', 'Petrucci MT', 'Gregorj C', 'Ariola C', 'Lemoli RM', 'Fogli M', 'Mauro FR', 'Cerretti R', 'Foa R', 'Mandelli F', 'Tafuri A']","[""Haematology, Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University 'La Sapienza' of Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2708 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02708.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 May;113(2):391-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02708.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety-six previously untreated patients with aggressive ATL were enrolled and grouped as: acute type (58), lymphoma type (28) and unfavourable chronic type (10). Therapy consisted of seven cycles of VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone), AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine and prednisone) and VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin and prednisone). G-CSF was administered during the intervals between chemotherapy until neutrophil reconstitution was achieved. Eighty-one per cent of the 93 eligible patients responded [95% confidence interval (CI), 71.1-88.1%], with 33 patients obtaining complete response (35.5%) and 42 obtaining partial response (45.2%).
