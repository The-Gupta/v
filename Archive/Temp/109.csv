The leukemia samples corresponded to: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 40, CLL with more than 10% prolymphocytes (CLL/PL) 12, CLL mixed 9, prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) 5, and B-cell lymphoma in leukemic phase 13. DNA aneuploidy was found overall in 26 (32.9%) of the cases and these corresponded to: 7 (17.5%) with CLL, 7 (58.3%) with CLL/PL, 4 (44.4%) with CLL mixed, 2 (40%) with PLL and 6 (46.2%) with B-cell lymphoma. There was a good correlation between DNA content and cytogenetics/fluorescent in situ hybridization in all but 2 cases as follows: 6 of 7 cases with diploid DNA had normal karyotype and only one had trisomy 12: 4 of 6 cases with hyperdiploid DNA had trisomy 12, one had tetraploidy and only one had a normal karyotype. Two cases were hypodiploid both by DNA and cytogenetic analysis. Our findings demonstrate a higher incidence of DNA aneuploidy in B-cell lymphoma in leukemic phase, PLL, and atypical CLL in comparison with typical CLL and a good correlation with cytogenetics. We conclude that flow cytometric DNA analysis represents a useful, sensitive, and rapid method to detect and monitor minimal changes of DNA content in leukemic lymphocytes without the need of short-term cultures.","['Kamihira, S', 'Matutes, E', 'Marco, J', 'Hoda, S', 'Morilla, R', 'Owusuankomah, K', 'Crowford, A', 'Ellis, J', 'Catovsky, D']","['Kamihira S', 'Matutes E', 'Marco J', 'Hoda S', 'Morilla R', 'Owusuankomah K', 'Crowford A', 'Ellis J', 'Catovsky D']","['INST CANC RES,LONDON SW3 6JJ,ENGLAND.

An animal study suggesting a role for epinephrine and prostaglandin-E2 through reduced NK activity.,e19246,"In leukemia patients, stress and anxiety were suggested to predict poorer prognosis. Oncological patients experience ample physiological and psychological stress, potentially leading to increased secretion of stress factors, including epinephrine, corticosteroids, and prostaglandins. Here we tested whether environmental stress and these stress factors impact survival of leukemia-challenged rats, and studied mediating mechanisms. F344 rats were administered with a miniscule dose of 60 CRNK-16 leukemia cells, and were subjected to intermittent forced swim stress or to administration of physiologically relevant doses of epinephrine, prostaglandin-E(2) or corticosterone. Stress and each stress factor, and/or their combinations, doubled mortality rates when acutely applied simultaneously with, or two or six days after tumor challenge. Acute administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker nadolol diminished the effects of environmental stress, without affecting baseline survival rates. Prolonged beta-adrenergic blockade or COX inhibition (using etodolac) also increased baseline survival rates, possibly by blocking tumor-related or normal levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins. Searching for mediating mechanisms, we found that each of the stress factors transiently suppressed NK activity against CRNK-16 and YAC-1 lines on a per NK basis. In contrast, the direct effects of stress factors on CRNK-16 proliferation, vitality, and VEGF secretion could not explain or even contradicted the in vivo survival findings. Overall, it seems that environmental stress, epinephrine, and prostaglandins promote leukemia progression in rats, potentially through suppressing cell mediated immunity. Thus, patients with hematological malignancies, which often exhibit diminished NK activity, may benefit from extended beta-blockade and COX inhibition.","['Inbar, Shelly', 'Neeman, Elad', 'Avraham, Roi', 'Benish, Marganit', 'Rosenne, Ella', 'Ben-Eliyahu, Shamgar']","['Inbar S', 'Neeman E', 'Avraham R', 'Benish M', 'Rosenne E', 'Ben-Eliyahu S']","['Neuroimmunology Research Unit, Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/05/12 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/12 06:00'],"['2010/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0019246 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-06187 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Apr 29;6(4):e19246. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019246.,10.1371/journal.pone.0019246 [doi],20110429,"['K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Epinephrine/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Swimming', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']","['R01 CA125456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA125456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3084788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Central to DNA damage response are the two checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR that phosphorylate a wide range of substrates. RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3) was initially identified as a substrate of ATM/ATR from a proteomic screen. Subsequent studies showed that RFWD3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53 in vitro and positively regulates p53 levels in response to DNA damage. We report here that RFWD3 associates with replication protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays essential roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Binding of RPA to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is generated by DNA damage and repair, is essential for the recruitment of DNA repair factors to damaged sites and the activation of checkpoint signaling. We show that RFWD3 is physically associated with RPA and rapidly localizes to sites of DNA damage in a RPA-dependent manner. In vitro experiments suggest that the C terminus of RFWD3, which encompass the coiled-coil domain and the WD40 domain, is necessary for binding to RPA. Furthermore, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of RPA and RFWD3 is dependent upon each other. Consequently, loss of RFWD3 results in the persistent foci of DNA damage marker gammaH2AX and the repair protein Rad51 in damaged cells. These findings suggest that RFWD3 is recruited to sites of DNA damage and facilitates RPA-mediated DNA damage signaling and repair.","['Liu, Shangfeng', 'Chu, Jessica', 'Yucer, Nur', 'Leng, Mei', 'Wang, Shih-Ya', 'Chen, Benjamin P C', 'Hittelman, Walter N', 'Wang, Yi']","['Liu S', 'Chu J', 'Yucer N', 'Leng M', 'Wang SY', 'Chen BP', 'Hittelman WN', 'Wang Y']","['Center for Molecular Discovery, Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2011/05/12 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/05/12 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)48941-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.222802 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 24;286(25):22314-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.222802.

The synthesis of all newly prepared compounds is presented here. Structure confirmation of all generated compounds was accomplished by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR and MS spectroscopy methods. All the prepared compounds were analyzed using RP-TLC, and their lipophilicity (R(M)) was determined. The hydrophobicity (logP) and solubility (logS) of the studied compounds were also calculated using two commercially available programs. All the target compounds were tested for their in vitro transdermal penetration activity and as potential intestinal absorption enhancers. The anti-proliferative activity of all the final compounds was also assessed against the human cancer cell lines: T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line and the breast adenocarcinoma cell line. Their cytotoxicity was also evaluated against the normal human skin fibroblast cells. Two compounds showed anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells without affecting the growth of normal cells, which should be promising in potential development of new drugs. Most of the target compounds showed minimal anti-proliferative activity (IC(50)>37 muM), indicating they would have low cytotoxicity when administered as chemical absorption modifiers.

METHODS: Total DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of one case with T-ALL. Using the fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization (fine-tiling aCGH) to analyze the genomic DNA differences of the case and control group, we could find the breakpoints and their position in the chromosomes. According to the preliminary results, we could design the specific primers for the positions of the breakpoints relative to sequence. Furthermore, the ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) and sequence analysis were used to identify the TCR gene rearrangement. And TCR gene expression was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The fine-tiling aCGH results of the T-ALL showed that the TCRalpha/delta locus of chromosome 14 appeared four breakpoints, corresponding to TCR Vdelta1, Vdelta2, Jdelta1 and Jdelta2. By LM-PCR, sequencing and sequence analysis, TCR gene of the case of T-ALL was involved in Vdelta1Ddelta2Ddelta3Jdelta1, Vdelta2Ddelta3Jdelta2 rearrangement. RT-PCR results also confirmed the expression of these TCR gene rearrangements. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that fine-tiling aCGH and LM-PCR techniques could be used to identify the TCR gene rearrangement as one of the best perfect methods. And it was also a way to find some fusion genes involving in TCR gene.","['Zheng, Hai-tao', 'Ye, Tie-zhen', 'Chen, Shao-hua', 'Yang, Li-jian', 'Lu, Yu-hong', 'Li, Yang-qiu']","['Zheng HT', 'Ye TZ', 'Chen SH', 'Yang LJ', 'Lu YH', 'Li YQ']","[""Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. avery-2006@163.com""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,2011/05/12 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2011/05/12 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2011 May;27(5):483-6.,,,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We extracted information on the type of study, patient characteristics, definition of MBL deficiency, definition of infection and method of detection, follow-up period and the results of the outcome in different groups. The validity of each study was assessed. RESULTS: Six cohort studies were retrieved, consisting of 581 children with leukemia (n = 2) or varying types of cancer (n = 4). Many different outcome definitions were used. In only one out of three genotype studies, variant MBL2 genotypes, as well as MBL levels < 1,000 microg/L, were associated with an increased duration of FN. In one additional MBL level study the number of FN episodes, bacteremia and severe bacterial infection were increased in patients with MBL levels < 100 microg/L as compared to those with MBL levels of 100-999 microg/L. Sepsis, pneumonia, viral infection, and fungal infection were not associated with either MBL levels or genotypes in any of the studies.

Fine and Gray proposed a proportional hazards regression model to directly model the subdistribution of a competing risk. They developed the estimating procedure for right-censored competing risks data, based on the inverse probability of censoring weighting. Right-censored and left-truncated competing risks data sometimes occur in biomedical researches. In this paper, we study the proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with right-censored and left-truncated data. We adopt a new weighting technique to estimate the parameters in this model. We have derived the large sample properties of the proposed estimators. To illustrate the application of the new method, we analyze the failure time data for children with acute leukemia. In this example, the failure times for children who had bone marrow transplants were left truncated.","['Zhang, Xu', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Fine, Jason']","['Zhang X', 'Zhang MJ', 'Fine J']","['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA. matxxz@langate.gsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.4264 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2011 Jul 20;30(16):1933-51. doi: 10.1002/sim.4264.

The cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was 36, 68, 84 and 120 mg/m (2), respectively. The frequency and severity of relapses as well as disability scores, decreased in the year after treatment onset. Short-term adverse events were transient in all cases. Cardiac monitoring by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction during treatment in 1 patient, which was again normal at the next assessment. Long-term adverse events, including late-onset mitoxantrone-induced cardiotoxicity or secondary leukemia did not occur during the follow-up period. In our cohort of pediatric MS patients, mitoxantrone showed short-term reduction of disease activity and no long-term adverse events on follow-up.

We chose 22 patients with MDS, 7 patients with de novo AML, and 8 patients with non-clonal cytopenia diseases. We performed flow cytometric analysis of CD34(+) cells apoptosis using annexinV-FITC, which binds to exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. The cell adhesion capability was detected by CCK-8 assay. The migration ability of the cell was checked by transwell assay. Furthermore, we measured SDF-1 levels in BM plasma from patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results indicated that the apoptosis of CD34(+) cell was significantly increased in the Low-grade MDS (IPSS score </= 1.0) patients compared with the high-grade MDS (IPSS score >/= 1.5) (21.33% vs. 7.27%, P < 0.001) and patients with de novo AML (21.33% vs. 7.53%, P < 0.001). SDF-1 promoted CXCR4 high expression cells adhesion to the stroma cells (MSC) and induced these cells migration. SDF-1 could trigger the occurrence of polarized morphology of the cells that expressed CXCR4 high. After addition of wortmannin or PTX, the ability of adhesion and migration of the cells that expressed CXCR4 high decreased. But in the patient's cells that expressed CXCR4 low, there was no above-mentioned phenomenon. So we can suppose that the signaling pathway of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is PI3K pathway, and we should do more things about this pathway and may find out the target treatment of MDS.","['Yang, Rui', 'Pu, Jie', 'Guo, Juan', 'Xu, Feng', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Zhao, Youshan', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Gu, Shucheng', 'Chang, Chunkang', 'Li, Xiao']","['Yang R', 'Pu J', 'Guo J', 'Xu F', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Gu S', 'Chang C', 'Li X']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital Affiliated of Shanghai Jiaotong University, 200233 Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,2011/05/11 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-9943-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Jun;29(2):1202-8. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-9943-7.

The p53-regulated inhibitor of CDKs (PIC1) is a universal CDKI whose gene expression is directly induced by the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction revealed strong PIC1 gene expression in control MRC-5 human embryo lung cells, but relatively weaker bands in A549 lung carcinoma; Hep3B, Mahlavu, PLC/PRF/5 hepatocellular carcinoma; SiHa, CaSki, HeLa cervical carcinoma; T24 bladder carcinoma; MCF7 breast carcinoma; Raji Burkitt lymphoma; HT-1080 fibrosarcoma; and G-401 Wilms' tumor cell lines. These data are consistent with other results obtained by Northern and Western blot and immunoprecipitation techniques, indicating diminished PIC1 expression in cancer cells especially those harboring mutated p53, or human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins which abrogate p53 activity. PIC1 gene expression was absent in the Molt-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line with a previously documented alternatively-spliced p53 transcript translating into p53 protein truncated at the carboxyl terminus. It is proposed that this aberrant p53 interferes with the binding of wild-type p53 and other transcription factors to the PIC1 promoter thereby abolishing PIC1 gene expression. This Molt-4 cell line could serve as a useful experimental system for studying the interaction between p53 and other cellular factors with the PIC1 gene. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct cycle DNA sequencing analyses demonstrated a PIC1 variant (with an AGC to AGA substitution at codon 31 culminating in a serine to arginine replacement) in Mahlavu, PLC/PRF/5, SiHa, A549 and Raji cell lines. The higher proportion of the PIC1 variant in cancer cell lines (5/13 or 38%) compared with normal individuals (14%), coupled with differences between the predicted secondary structures of the normal and variant PIC1 proteins merit further investigations to elucidate the biological significance of this variant.","['Chow, V', 'Ang, W']","['Chow V', 'Ang W']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.6.4.871 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1995 Apr;6(4):871-6. doi: 10.3892/ijo.6.4.871.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm that THP-1 cells produce activin-A, we also determined the presence of immunoreactivity for activin-A by immunocytochemistry. We observed that messenger RNA encoding activin beta A-subunit was also expressed in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, the identity of RT-PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

RNR activity is considerably higher in malignant tumors than in normal tissues in the rat suggesting that RNR may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human tumors. In order to obtain immunological reagents to study the localization and level of expression of RNR in various human tissues, a synthetic peptide containing sequences corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of the human R2 subunit was used to generate rat monoclonal antibodies. The generated rat monoclonal antibodies (IgG) inhibited RNR enzymatic activity purified from murine P388 leukemia cells. These antibodies were used to immunohistochemically examine the distribution of RNR in a small panel of 8 malignant and 4 benign human breast tumors. Positive immunostaining for RNR was observed in the cytoplasm of human breast carcinoma cells in which a specific 44 kDa specific band of R2 subunit was also detected by Western blot analysis. The immunostaining was blocked by preabsorption of the antibody with an excess amount of the synthetic peptide immunogen. In 8 of 8 breast carcinomas, positive immunostaining for the R2 subunit was observed whereas noninvolved, adjacent breast tissue showed no staining with this antibody. In addition, few of the benign breast lesions exhibited staining with this antibody. These data indicate that these antibodies can immunohistochemically detect RNR in frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded tissues and that there is a differential expression of RNR between breast tumors and non-involved breast tissue. Immunohistochemical detection of RNR using these antibodies may therefore be useful for the diagnosis of human breast tumors.","['Saeki, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Okabe, M', 'Furuya, A', 'Hanai, N', 'Yamagami, K', 'Mandai, K', 'Moriwaki, S', 'Doihara, H', 'Takashima, S', 'Salomon, D']","['Saeki T', 'Takahashi T', 'Okabe M', 'Furuya A', 'Hanai N', 'Yamagami K', 'Mandai K', 'Moriwaki S', 'Doihara H', 'Takashima S', 'Salomon D']","['NCI,TUMOR GROWTH FACTOR SECT,TUMOR IMMUNOL & BIOL LAB,BETHESDA,MD 20892.

It is thus the first dominant negative transcription factor acting as an oncogene described to date. Functional and biochemical dissections of this oncogene have brought many informations on the mechanisms of action of normal receptors and on the ways through which altered receptors can contribute to oncogenic transformation. The v-erbA model is widely used as a reference to investigate the involvement of nuclear hormone receptors in the development of human cancers.,"['Gandrillon, O', 'Rascle, A', 'Samarut, J']","['Gandrillon O', 'Rascle A', 'Samarut J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.6.1.215 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1995 Jan;6(1):215-31. doi: 10.3892/ijo.6.1.215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phase II studies have shown that most of these patients will respond to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. Both nilotinib and dasatinib have recently demonstrated clinical efficacy as frontline therapy in Phase III studies. In the ENESTnd trial, nilotinib 600-800 mg/day produced significantly higher major molecular rates and complete cytogenetic response rates in comparison with imatinib at 12 months. Recently, 18-month follow-up analysis of this trial continues to demonstrate superiority for nilotinib. It is unknown whether this will ultimately translate into improved long-term outcomes, such as event-free survival or overall survival. Nilotinib continues to be generally well tolerated and tends to produce less Grade 3/4 toxicity in frontline therapy when compared with its use following imatinib failure.

This lineage-restricted pathway can be controlled by particular regulators, which are usually exclusively expressed in certain cell types or at specific differentiation stages. Here we report that miR-376a participates in the regulation of the early stages of human erythropoiesis by targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and Argonaute 2 (Ago2). Among various human leukemia cell lines, miR-376a was only detected in K562 cells which originated from a progenitor common to the erythroid and megakaryotic lineages. Enforced expression of miR-376a or silencing of CDK2 and Ago2 by RNAi inhibits erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with miR-376a showed a significant reduction of their erythroid clonogenic capacity. MiR-376a is relatively abundant in erythroid progenitor cells, where it reduces expression of CDK2 and maintains a low level of differentiation due to cell cycle arrest and decreased cell growth. Following erythroid induction, miR-376a is significantly down-regulated and CDK2 is released from miR-376a inhibition, thereby facilitating the escape of progenitor cells from the quiescent state into erythroid differentiation. Moreover, our results establish a functional link between miR-376a and Ago2, a key factor in miRNA biogenesis and silencing pathways with novel roles in human hematopoiesis.","['Wang, Fang', 'Yu, Jia', 'Yang, Gui-Hua', 'Wang, Xiao-Shuang', 'Zhang, Jun-Wu']","['Wang F', 'Yu J', 'Yang GH', 'Wang XS', 'Zhang JW']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 5 Dong Dan San Tiao, Beijing 100005, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['cr201179 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2011.79 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2011 Aug;21(8):1196-209. doi: 10.1038/cr.2011.79.

Apoptosis is a pathway to cell death while autophagy can protect from photokilling or act as a death pathway. In a previous study, we reported a cytoprotective effect of autophagy in murine leukemia cell lines where both autophagy and apoptosis occur within minutes after irradiation of photosensitized cells. In this study, we examined the effects of mitochondrial photodamage catalyzed by low (</= 1 muM) concentrations of the photosensitizing agent termed benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD, Verteporfin) on murine hepatoma 1c1c7 cells. Apoptosis was not observed until several hours after irradiation of photosensitized cells. Autophagy was clearly cytoprotective since PDT efficacy was significantly enhanced in a knockdown sub-line (KD) in which the level of a critical autophagy protein (Atg7) was markedly reduced. This result indicates that autophagy can protect from phototoxicity even when apoptosis is substantially delayed. Much higher concentrations (>/= 10 muM) of BPD had previously been shown to inhibit autophagosome formation. Phototoxicity studies performed with 10 muM BPD and a proportionally reduced light dose were consistent with the absence of an autophagic process in wild-type (WT) cells under these conditions.","['Andrzejak, Michelle', 'Price, Michael', 'Kessel, David H']","['Andrzejak M', 'Price M', 'Kessel DH']","['Department of Biology, University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['15865 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.7.9.15865 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2011 Sep;7(9):979-84. doi: 10.4161/auto.7.9.15865.

Herein, we used a large prospective cohort study to examine these associations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 64,839 men and women age 50 to 76 years were recruited from 2000 to 2002 to the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) study. Incident hematologic malignancies (n = 577) were identified through December 2008 by linkage to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with use of analgesics for total incident hematologic malignancies and cancer subcategories were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, self-rated health, arthritis, chronic musculoskeletal pain, migraines, headaches, fatigue, and family history of leukemia/lymphoma. RESULTS: After adjustment, there was an increased risk of incident hematologic malignancies associated with high use (>/= 4 days/week for >/= 4 years) of acetaminophen (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.50 for high use; P trend = .004). This association was seen for myeloid neoplasms (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.12), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.93), and plasma cell disorders (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.08 to 5.41), but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.31 to 2.28). By comparison, there was no association with risk of incident hematologic malignancies for increasing use of aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs, or ibuprofen. CONCLUSION: High use of acetaminophen was associated with an almost two-fold increased risk of incident hematologic malignancies other than CLL/SLL. Neither aspirin nor nonaspirin NSAIDs are likely useful for prevention of hematologic malignancies.","['Walter, Roland B', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Brasky, Theodore M', 'White, Emily']","['Walter RB', 'Milano F', 'Brasky TM', 'White E']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N., Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.6346 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.6346 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 10;29(17):2424-31. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.6346.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 254 adult patients with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) who achieved CR after induction chemotherapy on various first-line protocols were examined. RESULTS: Median follow-up for surviving patients was 43 months. Patients with cytogenetic abnormalities at CR (n = 71) had significantly shorter RFS (P = .001) and OS (P < .001) compared with patients with normal cytogenetics at CR (n = 183); 3-year RFS was 15% and 45%, and 3-year OS was 15% and 56%, respectively. Among the patients with persistent cytogenetic abnormalities at CR, those who underwent SCT in first CR (CR1; n = 15) had better RFS and OS compared to those without SCT (n = 56; P = .04 and .06, respectively). In multivariate analysis, persistent cytogenetic abnormalities at CR was an independent predictor for RFS (P < .001) and OS (P = .001), but among patients with persistent cytogenetic abnormalities at CR, no significant differences in OS (P = .25) was observed between those who did or did not receive SCT with a trend favoring SCT for RFS (P = .08). CONCLUSION: Persistent cytogenetically abnormal cells at CR predict a significantly shorter RFS and OS. SCT in CR1 may improve the clinical outcome of patients lacking cytogenetic remission after induction although this depends on patient selection.","['Chen, Yiming', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Qiao, Wei', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'De Lima, Marcos', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Chen Y', 'Cortes J', 'Estrov Z', 'Faderl S', 'Qiao W', 'Abruzzo L', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Pierce S', 'Huang X', 'Kebriaei P', 'Kadia T', 'De Lima M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.34.2873 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.34.2873 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 20;29(18):2507-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.34.2873.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: RNA-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) specific for the detection of six different NPM1(mut) types was applied to 1,682 samples (bone marrow, n = 1,272; blood, n = 410) serially obtained from 245 intensively treated younger adult patients who were 16 to 60 years old. RESULTS: NPM1(mut) transcript levels as a continuous variable were significantly associated with prognosis after each treatment cycle. Achievement of RQ-PCR negativity after double induction therapy identified patients with a low cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; 6.5% after 4 years) compared with RQ-PCR-positive patients (53.0%; P < .001); this translated into significant differences in overall survival (90% v 51%, respectively; P = .001). After completion of therapy, CIR was 15.7% in RQ-PCR-negative patients compared with 66.5% in RQ-PCR-positive patients (P < .001). Multivariable analyses after double induction and after completion of consolidation therapy revealed higher NPM1(mut) transcript levels as a significant factor for a higher risk of relapse and death. Serial post-treatment assessment of MRD allowed early detection of relapse in patients exceeding more than 200 NPM1(mut)/10(4) ABL copies. CONCLUSION: We defined clinically relevant time points for NPM1(mut) MRD assessment that allow for the identification of patients with AML who are at high risk of relapse. Monitoring of NPM1(mut) transcript levels should be incorporated in future clinical trials to guide therapeutic decisions.","['Kronke, Jan', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Jensen, Kai-Ole', 'Tschurtz, Florian', 'Corbacioglu, Andrea', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Onken, Shiva', 'Eiwen, Karina', 'Habdank, Marianne', 'Spath, Daniela', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Wattad, Mohammed', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Held, Gerhard', 'Nachbaur, David', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Mergenthaler, Hans-Gunther', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Kronke J', 'Schlenk RF', 'Jensen KO', 'Tschurtz F', 'Corbacioglu A', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Paschka P', 'Onken S', 'Eiwen K', 'Habdank M', 'Spath D', 'Lubbert M', 'Wattad M', 'Kindler T', 'Salih HR', 'Held G', 'Nachbaur D', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Germing U', 'Haase D', 'Mergenthaler HG', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/09/07 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.0371 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.0371 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jul 1;29(19):2709-16. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.0371.

Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24), an IL-10 family cytokine, exhibits pleiotropic anticancer activities without adversely affecting normal cells. We previously demonstrated that suppression of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), is required for mda-7/IL-24-mediated apoptosis of prostate carcinomas. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 expression with the unique Apogossypol derivative BI-97C1, also called Sabutoclax, is sufficient to sensitize prostate tumors to mda-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis, whereas ABT-737, which lacks efficacy in inhibiting Mcl-1, does not sensitize mda-7/IL-24-mediated cytotoxicity. A combination regimen of tropism-modified adenovirus delivered mda-7/IL-24 (Ad.5/3-mda-7) and BI-97C1 enhances cytotoxicity in human PC cells, including those resistant to mda-7/IL-24 or BI-97C1 alone. The combination regimen causes autophagy that facilitates NOXA- and Bim-induced and Bak/Bax-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Treatment with Ad.5/3-mda-7 and BI-97C1 significantly inhibits the growth of human PC xenografts in nude mice and spontaneously induced PC in Hi-myc transgenic mice. Tumor growth inhibition correlated with increased TUNEL staining and decreased Ki-67 expression in both PC xenografts and prostates of Hi-myc mice. These findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 with the Apogossypol derivative, BI-97C1, sensitizes human PCs to mda-7/IL-24-mediated cytotoxicity, thus potentially augmenting the therapeutic benefit of this combinatorial approach toward PC.","['Dash, Rupesh', 'Azab, Belal', 'Quinn, Bridget A', 'Shen, Xuening', 'Wang, Xiang-Yang', 'Das, Swadesh K', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Wei, Jun', 'Hedvat, Michael', 'Dent, Paul', 'Dmitriev, Igor P', 'Curiel, David T', 'Grant, Steven', 'Wu, Bainan', 'Stebbins, John L', 'Pellecchia, Maurizio', 'Reed, John C', 'Sarkar, Devanand', 'Fisher, Paul B']","['Dash R', 'Azab B', 'Quinn BA', 'Shen X', 'Wang XY', 'Das SK', 'Rahmani M', 'Wei J', 'Hedvat M', 'Dent P', 'Dmitriev IP', 'Curiel DT', 'Grant S', 'Wu B', 'Stebbins JL', 'Pellecchia M', 'Reed JC', 'Sarkar D', 'Fisher PB']","['Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University Institute of Molecular Medicine, and Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/10/08 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1100769108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1100769108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 May 24;108(21):8785-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1100769108.

The gene is known to express inappropriately in many types of human myeloid leukemias and solid tumors. Forced expression of EVI1 in murine hematopoietic precursor cells lead to abnormal differentiation and increased proliferation. EVI1 encodes two sets of zinc finger domains due to which it behaves as a transcriptional factor. However, except a few, the targets of EVI1 are not well understood and hence also the mechanism by which it initiates oncogenesis is not very clear. In this report, we show that SIRT1, a histone deacetylase is a direct target of EVI1. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that EVI1 binds to the promoter region of SIRT1 approximately 1kb upstream of the transcription start site. The functionality of the site was deduced by luciferase assay which showed that EVI1 significantly increases the SIRT1 promoter activity. SIRT1 was also found to be up regulated in cell lines and in chronic myeloid leukemia patient samples where EVI1 was detected. Over expression of SIRT1 in cells shows that it interacts with EVI1 and this interaction lead to the deacetylation of the protein. Upon deacetylation the stability of EVI1 was found to be affected which was negatively regulated by nicotinamide (NAM). Our results thus identify an EVI1-SIRT1 axis in the regulation of EVI1 activity suggesting a possible role of SIRT1 in EVI1 positive neoplasms.","['Pradhan, Anjan Kumar', 'Kuila, Nivedita', 'Singh, Sneha', 'Chakraborty, Soumen']","['Pradhan AK', 'Kuila N', 'Singh S', 'Chakraborty S']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Department of Gene Function and Regulation, Nako Square, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, PIN-751023, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2010/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-9399(11)00064-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagrm.2011.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2011 Apr-Jun;1809(4-6):269-75. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2011.04.007.

This problem of sensitivity is even more relevant in acquired mosaicism in neoplastic diseases, where cells carrying acquired imbalances coexist with normal cells, in particular when the proportion of abnormal cells may be low.We constructed a synthetic mosaicism by mixing the DNA of three patients carrying altogether seven chromosome imbalances with normal sex-matched DNA. Dilutions were prepared mimicking 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 10% and 15% levels of mosaicism. Oligomer-based a-CGH (244 K whole-genome system) was applied on the patients' DNA and customized slides designed around the regions of imbalance were used for the synthetic mosaics. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The a-CGH on the synthetic mosaics proved to be able to detect as low as 8% abnormal cells in the tissue examined. Although in our experiment some regions of imbalances escaped to be revealed at this level, and were detected only at 10-15% level, it should be remarked that these ones were the smallest analyzed, and that the imbalances recurrent as clonal anomalies in cancer and leukaemia are similar in size to those revealed at 8% level.","['Valli, Roberto', 'Marletta, Cristina', 'Pressato, Barbara', 'Montalbano, Giuseppe', 'Lo Curto, Francesco', 'Pasquali, Francesco', 'Maserati, Emanuela']","['Valli R', 'Marletta C', 'Pressato B', 'Montalbano G', 'Lo Curto F', 'Pasquali F', 'Maserati E']","[""Biologia e Genetica, Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche, Universita dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy. emanuela.maserati@uninsubria.it.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/05/11 06:01,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/11 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-4-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-4-13 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2011 May 9;4:13. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-4-13.,10.1186/1755-8166-4-13 [doi],20110509,,,,,PMC3101650,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still unknown whether these effects change from early to later adulthood. We used the data of the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to further analyze these effects. METHODS: We selected over 5.7 million offspring with identified parents but no parental cancer. We estimated the effect of birth order and family size by Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, period, region and socioeconomic status. We divided the age at diagnosis in two groups, below and over 50 years, to identify the effect of family size and birth order for different age periods. RESULTS: Negative associations for increasing birth order were found for endometrial, testicular, skin, thyroid and connective tissue cancers and melanoma. In contrast, we observed positive association between birth order and lung, male and female genital cancers. Family size was associated with decreasing risk for endometrial and testicular cancers, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma; risk was increased for leukemia and nervous system cancer. The effect of birth order decreased for lung and endometrial cancer from age at diagnosis below to over 50 years. Combined effects for birth order and family size were marginally significant for thyroid gland tumors. Especially, the relative risk for follicular thyroid gland tumors was significantly decreased for increasing birth order. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the effect of birth order decreases from early to late adulthood for lung and endometrial cancer.","['Bevier, Melanie', 'Weires, Marianne', 'Thomsen, Hauke', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Bevier M', 'Weires M', 'Thomsen H', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany. m.bevier@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2010/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-163 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-163 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 May 9;11:163. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-163.,10.1186/1471-2407-11-163 [doi],20110509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Birth Order', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual', '*Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,PMC3103479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical features and cytogenetics are essential to make a diagnosis because blast count alone is insufficient to differentiate MDS from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Little is known about molecular genetics in paediatric MDS but hypermethylation seem to be frequent. Monosomy 7 is the most common cytogenetic aberration but prognostic neutral whereas those with structural complex karyotype have a very poor outcome. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice and results in cure rates of around 60%. Intensive chemotherapy prior to HSCT provides no survival benefit for children with RAEB and RAEB-T and can generally not be recommended. Intensive chemotherapy before HSCT should be considered in patients with myelodysplasia-related-AML (MDR-AML).,"['Hasle, Henrik', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M']","['Hasle H', 'Niemeyer CM']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark. hasle@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08724.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jul;154(2):185-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08724.x.

Simultaneously, we investigated the morphology and ultrastructure of the B lymphocytes that belonged to the normal persons and B-CLL patients through utilizing the atomic force microscope (AFM). In addition, we measured the force spectroscopy of CD20 antigen-antibody binding using the AFM tips modified with CD20 antibody. The fluorescent images indicated that the density of CD20 of normal CD20+B lymphocytes was much higher than that of B-CLL CD20+B cells. The AFM data show that ultrastructure of B-CLL CD20+B lymphocytes became more complicated. Moreover, the single molecular force spectroscopy data show that the special force of CD20 antigen-antibody was four times bigger than the nonspecific force between the naked AFM tip and cell surface. The force map showed that CD20 molecules distributed homogeneously on the normal CD20+B lymphocytes, whereas, the CD20 molecules distributed heterogenous on B-CLL CD20+B lymphocytes. Our data provide visualized evidence for the phenomenon of low-response to rituximab therapy on clinical.

She was treated with combined acute myeloid leukaemia/acute lymphoblastic leukaemia induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. The patient died due to the complications of stem cell transplantation procedure. Another patient was a 20-month-old girl with myeloid and T-lymphoid associated antigens in the blast cells and with normal karyotype. She received acute myeloid leukaemia induction therapy. She has never achieved remission. DISCUSSION: Immunophenotype is essential to establish the diagnosis of biphenotypic acute leukaemia according to the scoring system adopted by the European Group of Immunological Classification of Leukaemia. There is no agreement about uniformity in treatment for the patients with this type of leukaemia. Biphenotypic acute leukaemia is a high risk leukaemia which requires a more intensive treatment. CONCLUSION: Therapy for every patient with biphenotypic acute leukaemia should depend on their immunophenotype and gene rearrangement profiles.,"['Kacanski, Natasa', 'Konstantinidis, Nada', 'Kolarovic, Jovanka', 'Slavkovic, Bojana', 'Vujic, Dragana']","['Kacanski N', 'Konstantinidis N', 'Kolarovic J', 'Slavkovic B', 'Vujic D']","['Institut za zdravstvenu zastitu dece i omladine Vojvodine, Novi Sad. natasa.kacanski@sbb.r']",['srp'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/06/08 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/mpns1012867k [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pregl. 2010 Nov-Dec;63(11-12):867-9. doi: 10.2298/mpns1012867k.,,,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Primary objectives were to assess remission rates, treatment related toxicity and disease free survival. Secondary objective was to assess prognostic factors associated with poor outcome. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia, less than 18 year of age from Sept 2005 to Aug 2009 was done. Clinical laboratory, treatment and follow up records retrieved to calculate remission rate, treatment related toxicity, disease free survival and poor prognostic factors. RESULTS: This analysis included thirty five patients (male : female; 23:12), twenty seven (77.1%) achieved remission after one 3 + 7 induction and seven required two inductions. High dose cytosine arabinoside consolidation was given in thirty one patients while one underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation. Two patients died during chemotherapy (TRM- 5.7%), two did not complete the therapy, seventeen relapsed (48.5%) with 80% of relapses occurring within first year of remission and no relapse occurred after 2 years. Fourteen patients are in remission (40%, follow up 5-54 months) and cumulative median disease free survival is of 13 months. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggests that 3 + 7 induction, followed by high dose cytarabine consolidation has low treatment related toxicity and resource utilization; however, relapse free survival is inferior to more intensive regimens, highlighting the need to intensify chemotherapy regimen once the treatment related mortality has been minimized.","['Gupta, Nitin', 'Seth, Tulika', 'Mishra, Pravas', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Rathi, Shyam', 'Kapoor, Rajan', 'Agarwal, Narendra', 'Kumar, Suman', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Gupta N', 'Seth T', 'Mishra P', 'Mahapatra M', 'Rathi S', 'Kapoor R', 'Agarwal N', 'Kumar S', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ist Floor, IRCH Builiding, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,2011/05/10 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-010-0300-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2011 Oct;78(10):1211-5. doi: 10.1007/s12098-010-0300-1.

HLA-A0201-restricted peptide epitopes from PRAME have previously been identified as potential immunogens to drive antigen-specific autologous CTL responses, capable of lysing PRAME expressing tumour cells. CTL lines, from 13 normal donors and 10 melanoma patients, all of whom were HLA-A0201 positive, were generated against the PRAME peptide epitope PRA(100-108). Specific killing activity against PRA(100-108) peptide-pulsed targets was weak compared with CTL lines directed against known immunodominant peptides. Moreover, limiting dilution cloning from selected PRAME-specific CTL lines resulted in the generation of a clone of only low to intermediate avidity. Addition of the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-Deoxycytidine (DAC) increased PRAME expression in 7 out of 11 malignant cell lines including several B lineage leukaemia lines and also increased class I expression. Pre-treatment of target cells was associated with increased sensitivity to antigen-specific killing by the low avidity CTL. When CTL, as well as of the target cells, were treated, the antigen-specific killing was further augmented. Interestingly, one HLA-A0201-negative DAC-treated line (RAJI) showed increased sensitivity to killing by clones despite a failure of expression of PRAME or HLA-A0201. Together these data point to a general increased augmentation of cancer immunogenocity by DAC involving both antigen-specific and non-specific mechanisms.","['Yan, Mengyong', 'Himoudi, Nourredine', 'Basu, B Piku', 'Wallace, Rebecca', 'Poon, Edmund', 'Adams, Stuart', 'Hasan, Fyeza', 'Xue, Shao-An', 'Wilson, Natalie', 'Dalgleish, Angus', 'Williams, Owen', 'Anderson, John']","['Yan M', 'Himoudi N', 'Basu BP', 'Wallace R', 'Poon E', 'Adams S', 'Hasan F', 'Xue SA', 'Wilson N', 'Dalgleish A', 'Williams O', 'Anderson J']","['Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, University College London Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London WC1N 1EH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1024-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Sep;60(9):1243-55. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1024-4.

Quantitative evaluation of the percentage of apoptotic cells was carried out on a cell by cell basis by the flow cytometric DNA-content in situ-terminal-deoxynucleotydil-transferase (TdT assay).

UTI is a strong inhibitor for trypsin and HLE and is relatively resistant to inactivation by trypsin,while the decline in inhibitor activity of alpha 1AT proceeds faster by trypsin. UTI protects the inactivation of alpha 1AT by trypsin. The SEC receptor mediates neutrophil chemotactic activity of alpha 1AT-HLE complexes. UTI and UTI-trypsin complexes failed to bind to the SEC receptor on neutrophils, and they did not inhibit alpha 1AT-HLE complexes-mediated neutrophil chemotactic activity. When alpha 1AT treated with trypsin was incubated with HLE, neutrophil chemotactic activity was inhibited. In the presence of UTI, however, UTI protected neutrophil chemotaxis mediated through SEC receptor. The present study suggests another working hypothesis that, besides the effects on anti-protease activity, UTI plays an important role in inhibition of inactivation/degradation of alpha 1AT by trypsin and in protection of neutrophil chemotaxis.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Gotoh, J', 'Fujie, M', 'Terao, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Gotoh J', 'Fujie M', 'Terao T']","['HAMAMATSU UNIV SCH MED, CTR EQUIPMENT, HAMAMATSU, SHIZUOKA 43131, JAPAN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.7.4.817 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1995 Oct;7(4):817-23. doi: 10.3892/ijo.7.4.817.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The myeloid FDC-P1 cell line was sensitive to abrogation of growth factor-dependency by the constitutive expression of viral oncogenes (v-abl, v-src, v-Ha-ras, and v-fms) and the activated cellular oncogene BCR-ABL and Delta Nraf. The Delta Nraf encoded serine-threonine kinase was approximately 100-fold less efficient in relieving the factor-dependency of FDC-P1 cells than the other oncogenes examined. The synthesis of autocrine cytokines was not detected in the factor-independent FDC-P1 lines, indicating that the oncogene-mediated transformation occurred by a non-autocrine mechanism. A low frequency of cells were isolated after infection with the chronic retrovirus, murine leukemia virus and approximately 40% of these clones synthesized the autocrine lymphokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. In contrast, only the v-abl and BCR-ABL oncogenes relieved the cytokine-dependency of the lymphoid FL5.12 cell line. In all the transformed cell lines, the rate of glucose transport was elevated above the basal level seen in uninfected cells indicating that this pivotal growth-regulated protein was associated with malignant transformation. In summary, these cell lines varied with respect to abrogation of growth factor-dependency as the myeloid FDC-P1 line was sensitive to transformation by all oncogenes examined whereas only the abl-family members would relieve the cytokine-requirement of lymphoid FL5.12 cells.","['McCubrey, J', 'Steelman, L', 'Wang, X', 'Algate, P', 'Hoyle, P', 'White, C', 'Davidian, E', 'Prevost, K', 'Robbins, P', 'Mylott, D', 'White, M']","['McCubrey J', 'Steelman L', 'Wang X', 'Algate P', 'Hoyle P', 'White C', 'Davidian E', 'Prevost K', 'Robbins P', 'Mylott D', 'White M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.7.2.295 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1995 Aug;7(2):295-310. doi: 10.3892/ijo.7.2.295.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Levels of IL-8 and GM-CSF in circulation of various hematologic diseases are unknown. To demonstrate their importance in lymphoproliferative disorders, we have measured the circulating levels of these two cytokines from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD). IL-8 and GM-CSF levels were determined by highly specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. IL-8 levels were elevated in most patients with B-cell malignancies, B-cell CLL (B-CLL) and B-cell NHL (B-NHL) as well as in patients with HD. However, GM-CSF levels were higher in most patients with NHL (T-NHL and B-NHL) and HD. IL-8 was undetectable in T-cell malignancies (T-CLL and T-NHL), whereas GMCSF was undetectable from CLL (T-CLL and B-CLL). Of interest, IL-8 levels were correlated with white blood cell counts (WBC) in B-cell malignancies (B-CLL and B-NHL) but not in HD. These results suggest that both IL-8 and GMCSF may play an important role in pathophysiological changes in B-NHL and HD. IL-8 may be related with recruitment and activation of neutrophils, whereas, GM-CSF in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and immune response in these malignancies. The clinical status of B-CLL patients in regards to WBC counts appeared to be associated with the serum levels of IL-8.","['Sheikha, A', 'Aljanadi, M', 'Alhomrany, M', 'Raziuddin, S']","['Sheikha A', 'Aljanadi M', 'Alhomrany M', 'Raziuddin S']","['KING SAUD UNIV,DEPT CLIN & LAB HEMATOL,ABHA,SAUDI ARABIA.

FLT3 is therefore an attractive drug target. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FLT3 mutations lead to cell transformation in AML remain unclear. To develop a better understanding of FLT3 signaling as well as its downstream effectors, we performed detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of FLT3 signaling in human leukemia cells. We identified over 1000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about 750 proteins in both AML (wild type and mutant FLT3) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (normal and amplification of FLT3) cell lines. Furthermore, using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we were able to quantified over 400 phosphorylation sites (pTyr, pSer, and pThr) that were responsive to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 driven human leukemia cell lines. We also extended this phosphoproteomic analysis on bone marrow from primary AML patient samples, and identify over 200 tyrosine and 800 serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in vivo. This study showed that oncogenic FLT3 regulates proteins involving diverse cellular processes and affects multiple signaling pathways in human leukemia that we previously appreciated, such as Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling, BCR, and CD40 signaling pathways. It provides a valuable resource for investigation of oncogenic FLT3 signaling in human leukemia.","['Gu, Ting-lei', 'Nardone, Julie', 'Wang, Yi', 'Loriaux, Marc', 'Villen, Judit', 'Beausoleil, Sean', 'Tucker, Meghan', 'Kornhauser, Jon', 'Ren, Jianmin', 'MacNeill, Joan', 'Gygi, Steven P', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Rush, John', 'Polakiewicz, Roberto D']","['Gu TL', 'Nardone J', 'Wang Y', 'Loriaux M', 'Villen J', 'Beausoleil S', 'Tucker M', 'Kornhauser J', 'Ren J', 'MacNeill J', 'Gygi SP', 'Druker BJ', 'Heinrich MC', 'Rush J', 'Polakiewicz RD']","['Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts, United States of America. tgu@cellsignal.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0019169 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Apr 28;6(4):e19169. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019169.,10.1371/journal.pone.0019169 [doi],20110428,"['0 (Phosphoamino Acids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoamino Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",,PMC3084268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in CSC isolation were first achieved in hematological malignancies, with the first CSC demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia. However, using similar strategies and technologies, and taking advantage of available surface markers, CSCs have been more recently demonstrated in a growing range of epithelial and other solid organ malignancies, suggesting that the majority of malignancies are dependent on such a compartment.Primary liver cancer consists predominantly of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). It is believed that hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) could be the origin of some HCCs and ICCs. Furthermore, stem cell activators such as Wnt/beta-catenin, TGF-beta, Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways also expedite tumorigenesis, and these pathways could serve as molecular targets to assist in designing cancer prevention strategies. Recent studies indicate that additional factors such as EpCAM, Lin28 or miR-181 may also contribute to HCC progression by targeting HCC CSCs. Various therapeutic drugs that directly modulate CSCs have been examined in vivo and in vitro. However, CSCs clearly have a complex pathogenesis, with a considerable crosstalk and redundancy in signaling pathways, and hence targeting single molecules or pathways may have a limited benefit for treatment. Many of the key signaling molecules are shared by both CSCs and normal stem cells, which add further challenges for designing molecularly targeted strategies specific to CSCs but sparing normal stem cells to avoid side effects. In addition to the direct control of CSCs, many other factors that are needed for the maintenance of CSCs, such as angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, invasion and migration, hypoxia, immune evasion, multiple drug resistance, and radioresistance, should be taken into consideration when designing therapeutic strategies for HCC. Here we provide a brief review of molecular signaling in liver CSCs and present insights into new therapeutic strategies for targeting liver CSCs.","['Oishi, Naoki', 'Wang, Xin Wei']","['Oishi N', 'Wang XW']","['Liver Carcinogenesis Section, Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-4258, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7150/ijbs.7.517 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2011 Apr 26;7(5):517-35. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.7.517.,,20110426,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', '*Liver Regeneration', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['Z01 BC010313/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3088875,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BMI-1 signaling', 'Cholangiocellular carcinoma', 'EpCAM', 'Hedgehog signaling', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Lin-28', 'Liver cancer stem cell', 'Notch signaling', 'Self-protection', 'Self-renewal', 'TGF-beta signaling', 'Wnt/beta-catenin signaling', 'miR-181']",,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxically, expression of Tax in most cells leads to drastic up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1), which cause p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence. Here we demonstrate that p21(CIP1/WAF1)-/p27(KIP1)-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IKK/NF-kappaB hyper-activation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce IKK/NF-kappaB activation and prevented by blocking NF-kappaB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-kappaBalpha despite constitutive IKK activation. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown indicates that RelA induces this senescence program by acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex and RelB to stabilize p27(KIP1) protein and p21(CIP1/WAF1) mRNA respectively. Finally, we show that down-regulation of NF-kappaB by the HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, delay or prevent the onset of Tax-induced senescence. We propose that the balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection. Robust HTLV-1 replication and elevated Tax expression drive IKK/NF-kappaB hyper-activation and trigger senescence. HBZ, however, modulates Tax-mediated viral replication and NF-kappaB activation, thus allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate, persist, and evolve. Finally, inactivation of the senescence checkpoint can facilitate persistent NF-kappaB activation and leukemogenesis.","['Zhi, Huijun', 'Yang, Liangpeng', 'Kuo, Yu-Liang', 'Ho, Yik-Khuan', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Zhi H', 'Yang L', 'Kuo YL', 'Ho YK', 'Shih HM', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002025 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Apr;7(4):e1002025. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002025.

Using Pyrosequencing, we genotyped the alleles of the CT60 SNP of 79 DLI donors and correlated them with the post-DLI outcome of their matching recipients. The presence of a donor 'AA' or 'AG' CT60 genotype vs a 'GG' genotype was an independent factor for remaining in complete chimerism/remission post-DLI (odds ratio (OR) 2.61 vs 0.42, respectively, P=0.05).

To discover the genetic changes occurring in T-ALL, and those contributing to relapse, we studied zebrafish (Danio rerio) T-ALL samples using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We performed aCGH on 17 T-ALLs from four zebrafish T-ALL models, and evaluated similarities between fish and humans by comparing all D. rerio genes with copy number aberrations (CNAs) with a cohort of 75 published human T-ALLs analyzed by aCGH. Within all D. rerio CNAs, we identified 893 genes with human homologues and found significant overlap (67%) with the human CNA dataset. In addition, when we restricted our analysis to primary T-ALLs (14 zebrafish and 61 human samples), 10 genes were recurrently altered in > 3 zebrafish cancers and >/= 4 human cases, suggesting a conserved role for these loci in T-ALL transformation across species. We also conducted iterative allo-transplantation with three zebrafish malignancies. This technique selects for aggressive disease, resulting in shorter survival times in successive transplant rounds and modeling refractory and relapsed human T-ALL. Fifty-five percent of original CNAs were preserved after serial transplantation, demonstrating clonality between each primary and passaged leukemia. Cancers acquired an average of 34 new CNAs during passaging. Genes in these loci may underlie the enhanced malignant behavior of these neoplasias. We also compared genes from CNAs of passaged zebrafish malignancies with aCGH results from 50 human T-ALL patients who failed induction, relapsed or would eventually relapse. Again, many genes (88/164) were shared by both datasets. Further, nine recurrently altered genes in passaged D. rerio T-ALL were also found in multiple human T-ALL cases. These results suggest that zebrafish and human T-ALLs are similar at the genomic level, and are governed by factors that have persisted throughout evolution.","['Rudner, L A', 'Brown, K H', 'Dobrinski, K P', 'Bradley, D F', 'Garcia, M I', 'Smith, A C H', 'Downie, J M', 'Meeker, N D', 'Look, A T', 'Downing, J R', 'Gutierrez, A', 'Mullighan, C G', 'Schiffman, J D', 'Lee, C', 'Trede, N S', 'Frazer, J K']","['Rudner LA', 'Brown KH', 'Dobrinski KP', 'Bradley DF', 'Garcia MI', 'Smith AC', 'Downie JM', 'Meeker ND', 'Look AT', 'Downing JR', 'Gutierrez A', 'Mullighan CG', 'Schiffman JD', 'Lee C', 'Trede NS', 'Frazer JK']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['onc2011138 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.138 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Oct 13;30(41):4289-96. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.138.

Autophagy is also required for the maturation of various hematopoietic lineages, namely the erythroid and lymphoid ones, yet its role in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remained unexplored. While normal HSCs sustain life-long hematopoiesis, malignant transformation of HSCs or early progenitors leads to leukemia. Mechanisms protecting HSCs from cellular damage are therefore essential to prevent hematopoietic malignancies. By conditionally deleting the essential autophagy gene Atg7 in the hematopoietic system, we found that autophagy is required for the maintenance of true HSCs and therefore also of downstream hematopoietic progenitors. Loss of autophagy in HSCs leads to the expansion of a progenitor cell population in the bone marrow, giving rise to a severe, invasive myeloproliferation, which strongly resembles human acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","['Mortensen, Monika', 'Watson, Alexander Scarth', 'Simon, Anna Katharina']","['Mortensen M', 'Watson AS', 'Simon AK']","['Apoptosis Department and Center for Genotoxic Stress Research, Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['15886 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.7.9.15886 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2011 Sep;7(9):1069-70. doi: 10.4161/auto.7.9.15886.

Clinically, approximately 50% of cases will behave more aggressively. Here, we investigate the role of the major B-cell transcription factor E2A, a known regulator of B-cell survival and proliferation, to CLL persistence. We show that E2A is elevated at the mRNA and protein levels relative to normal B-cell subsets. E2A silencing in primary CLL cells leads to a significant increase in spontaneous apoptosis in both CD38(+) (aggressive) and CD38(-) (indolent) cases. Moreover, E2A knockdown synergizes with the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide to reduce CLL viability. E2A is known to restrain the proliferation of primary B and T lymphocytes at multiple stages of maturation and we report that targeted E2A disruption increases the frequency of Ki-67(+) CLL cells in the absence of effects on de novo proliferation. At the molecular level, E2A siRNA-treated CLL cells display reduced expression of key genes associated with survival and cell cycling including p27, p21 and mcl-1, of which the former two are known E2A target genes. Thus, E2A, a key transcription factor associated with the B-cell activation profile, regulates apoptosis in CLL and may contribute to disease pathology.","['Kardava, Lela', 'Yang, Qi', 'St Leger, Anthony', 'Foon, Kenneth A', 'Lentzsch, Suzanne', 'Vallejo, Abbe N', 'Milcarek, Christine', 'Borghesi, Lisa']","['Kardava L', 'Yang Q', 'St Leger A', 'Foon KA', 'Lentzsch S', 'Vallejo AN', 'Milcarek C', 'Borghesi L']","['Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,2011/05/10 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['dxr027 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxr027 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2011 Jun;23(6):375-84. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxr027.

The present study investigated microRNAs involved in human thymocyte differentiation by comparing the microRNA expression profiles of thymocytes at the double-positive, single-positive CD4(+) and single-positive CD8(+) maturation stages. Microarray analysis showed that each thymocyte population displays a distinct microRNA expression profile that reflects their developmental relationships. Moreover, analysis of small-RNA libraries generated from human unsorted and double-positive thymocytes and from mature peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, together with the microarray data, indicated a trend toward up-regulation of microRNA expression during T-cell maturation after the double-positive stage and revealed a group of microRNAs regulated during normal T-cell development, including miR-150, which is strongly up-regulated as maturation progresses. We showed that miR-150 targets NOTCH3, a member of the Notch receptor family that plays important roles both in T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis. Forced expression of miR-150 reduces NOTCH3 levels in T-cell lines and has adverse effects on their proliferation and survival. Overall, these findings suggest that control of the Notch pathway through miR-150 may have an important impact on T-cell development and physiology.","['Ghisi, Margherita', 'Corradin, Alberto', 'Basso, Katia', 'Frasson, Chiara', 'Serafin, Valentina', 'Mukherjee, Subhamoy', 'Mussolin, Lara', 'Ruggero, Katia', 'Bonanno, Laura', 'Guffanti, Alessandro', 'De Bellis, Gianluca', 'Gerosa, Gino', 'Stellin, Giovanni', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Bronte, Vincenzo', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Zanovello, Paola']","['Ghisi M', 'Corradin A', 'Basso K', 'Frasson C', 'Serafin V', 'Mukherjee S', 'Mussolin L', 'Ruggero K', 'Bonanno L', 'Guffanti A', 'De Bellis G', 'Gerosa G', 'Stellin G', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Basso G', 'Bronte V', 'Indraccolo S', 'Amadori A', 'Zanovello P']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44845-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-326629 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 30;117(26):7053-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-326629.

This phase 2 study explored the safety and efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide in previously untreated older AML patients with del(5q) who declined standard chemotherapy. Patients were treated with lenalidomide 50 mg daily for 28 days as induction therapy and 10 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among 37 evaluable patients, the median age was 74 years (range, 60-94), 21 (57%) were female, 19 (51%) had prior myelodysplastic syndrome, and 30 (81%) had pretreatment cytogenetic studies evaluated centrally. Six had isolated del(5q), 1 had del(5q) and +8, 23 had complex cytogenetics, and 7 others had del(5q) identified locally. Fourteen patients (38%) completed induction therapy: 7 patients died during induction therapy, 8 had disease progression, 7 had nonfatal adverse events, and 1 entered hospice. Eight patients started maintenance therapy. Five patients (14%) achieved a partial or complete response, 2 with isolated del(5q) and 3 with complex cytogenetics. Relapse-free survival was 5 months (range, 0-19). Median overall survival was 2 months for the entire population.

In 2009 the same virus was identified in a cohort of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). In 2010 a second related virus was identified in a separate group of CFS patients. A series of studies from disparate geographical areas have failed to substantiate this work. Most recently several papers have suggested that the detection of these viruses was explained by laboratory contamination. SOURCES OF DATA: All papers including the wording XMRV were abstracted from the NIH library of medicine database and included in the analysis. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: XMRV is a newly described retrovirus whose nucleic acid has been identified in samples from patients with both prostate cancer and CFS. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Opinions differ as to whether the detected nucleic acid indicates infection with this virus in this disease or whether laboratory contamination of samples accounts for its presence. GROWING POINTS: An increasing number of papers now refute the association of XMRV with human disease in humans although there is some evidence of serological reactivity to the virus. While it is unlikely that XMRV is a major cause of either prostate cancer or CFS, it can infect human cells and might yet have a role in human disease. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Further studies to either prove or disprove the disease association of the virus are ongoing.","['Kenyon, Julia C', 'Lever, Andrew M L']","['Kenyon JC', 'Lever AM']","[""Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's hospital, Cambridge, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br Med Bull,British medical bulletin,0376542,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/09/01 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ldr010 [pii]', '10.1093/bmb/ldr010 [doi]']",ppublish,Br Med Bull. 2011;98:61-74. doi: 10.1093/bmb/ldr010.

The purpose was to identify potential points to effectively break the BLV cycle of transmission in our dairy productive system. We detected early infection in 11.47% of newborn calves by nested PCR. From birth to 12 months, no evidence of new infections was observed. After 12 months of age, the detection of new reactors increased slowly with time, from 15.09% at 15 months to 24% at 27 months. After that, the number of reactors increased rapidly up to 40% and 60.76% at 30 and 36 months, respectively. This last 9-month period coincided with parturition and the entry into the milking herd. Real-time PCR showed that more than 75% of adult animals had low peripheral-blood proviral load. Complementary, all infected animals showed low levels of provirus in milk and colostrum. The most important finding was that even when management procedures to prevent BLV iatrogenic transmission were followed, no significant change was observed in the prevalence after three years, strongly suggesting that other way/s of transmission play a key role under natural conditions. This study showed an interesting baseline to draw an alternative approach based on selective segregation according to the peripheral-blood proviral load as a potential indicator of risk transmission, and as an alternative to classical control measures.","['Gutierrez, Geronimo', 'Alvarez, Irene', 'Politzki, Romina', 'Lomonaco, Marina', 'Dus Santos, Maria Jose', 'Rondelli, Flavia', 'Fondevila, Norberto', 'Trono, Karina']","['Gutierrez G', 'Alvarez I', 'Politzki R', 'Lomonaco M', 'Dus Santos MJ', 'Rondelli F', 'Fondevila N', 'Trono K']","['Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, INTA, CC 1712, Castelar, Argentina. ggutierrez@cnia.inta.gov.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1135(11)00209-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.03.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2011 Aug 5;151(3-4):255-63. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.03.035.

DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) induced apoptosis in MV4-11, but not in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. Another class of anti-epigenetic agent histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) inhibited the proliferation of both MV4-11 and MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. Notably, when 5-AzadC was combined with HDACI MS-275, apoptosis in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells was significantly enhanced in parallel with activation of the caspase cascade, up-regulation of p21waf1 and gamma-H2AX, and down-regulation of Mcl-1. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase 3 by the pan-caspase inhibitor attenuated the combination of 5-AzadC and MS-275-mediated apoptosis and down-regulation of Mcl-1 in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. Moreover, down-regulation of p21waf1 in MV4-11 R248W cells by a small interfering RNA blunted activation of caspase 3 after exposure to the combination of 5-AzadC and MS-275, indicating the role of p21waf1 to activate caspase 3. Taken together, TP53-independent up-regulation of p21waf1 activates caspase 3 and down-regulates Mcl-1 in AML cells.

It inhibits similar molecular targets to imatinib, but is a significantly more potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl. Nilotinib exhibits off-target effects in other tissues, and of relevance to bone metabolism, hypophosphataemia has been reported in up to 30% of patients receiving nilotinib. We have assessed the effects of nilotinib on bone cells in vitro and on bone metabolism in patients receiving nilotinib for treatment of CML. We firstly investigated the effects of nilotinib on proliferating and differentiating osteoblastic cells, and on osteoclastogenesis in murine bone marrow cultures and RAW264.7 cells. Nilotinib potently inhibited osteoblast proliferation (0.01-1uM), through inhibition of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR). There was a biphasic effect on osteoblast differentiation such that it was reduced by lower concentrations of nilotinib (0.1-0.5uM), with no effect at higher concentrations (1uM). Nilotinib also potently inhibited osteoclastogenesis, predominantly by stromal-cell dependent mechanisms. Thus, nilotinib decreased osteoclast development in murine bone marrow cultures, but did not affect osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells. Nilotinib treatment of osteoblastic cells increased expression and secretion of OPG and decreased expression of RANKL. In 10 patients receiving nilotinib, levels of bone turnover markers were in the low-normal range, despite secondary hyperparathyroidism, findings that are similar to those in patients treated with imatinib. Bone density tended to be higher than age and gender-matched normal values. These data suggest that nilotinib may have important effects on bone metabolism. Prospective studies should be conducted to determine the long-term effects of nilotinib on bone density and calcium metabolism.","[""O'Sullivan, Susannah"", 'Lin, Jian-Ming', 'Watson, Maureen', 'Callon, Karen', 'Tong, Pak Cheung', 'Naot, Dorit', 'Horne, Anne', 'Aati, Opetaia', 'Porteous, Fran', 'Gamble, Greg', 'Cornish, Jillian', 'Browett, Peter', 'Grey, Andrew']","[""O'Sullivan S"", 'Lin JM', 'Watson M', 'Callon K', 'Tong PC', 'Naot D', 'Horne A', 'Aati O', 'Porteous F', 'Gamble G', 'Cornish J', 'Browett P', 'Grey A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand. s.osullivan@auckland.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/12/15 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S8756-3282(11)00936-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2011.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2011 Aug;49(2):281-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2011.04.014.

For this technique the recombinant product is linked through a thrombin or factor Xa susceptible bond to the amino-terminal domain of the precursor of eosinophil major basic protein (MBP). This N-terminal domain is strongly acidic and is apparently able to shield eosinophils from the potentially injurious activities of MBP. It was reasoned that constructs of this acidic domain with small heterologous cationic proteins expressed in E. coli could result in soluble expression while preventing trafficking and packaging into insoluble inclusion bodies. This has been demonstrated using four examples: complement C5a, CCL18, fibroblast growth factor-beta, and leukemia inhibitory factor, whose isoelectric points range from 8.93 to 9.59. Further general applicability of this technique has been shown by using two different expression systems, one which encodes an amino-terminal oligo-histidine leash, and another that codes for an amino-terminal glutathione-S-transferase. Thus the utility of coupling MAP to cationic polypeptides for the purpose of soluble heterologous protein expression in E. coli has been demonstrated.","['DiScipio, Richard G', 'Khaldoyanidi, Sophia K', 'Schraufstatter, Ingrid U']","['DiScipio RG', 'Khaldoyanidi SK', 'Schraufstatter IU']","['Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, San Diego, CA 92121, United States. rdiscipio@tpims.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/10/29 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1046-5928(11)00108-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pep.2011.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 2011 Sep;79(1):72-80. doi: 10.1016/j.pep.2011.04.016.

Analogs with side-chains extended by one (PRI-1906) or two carbon units (PRI-1907) displayed similar or elevated cell-differentiating activity in comparison to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D), whereas further extending side-chain resulted in substantially lower biological activity (PRI-1908 and PRI-1909). Similar pattern of cell-differentiating activities to that observed in human cell lines has also been shown in blast cells isolated from patients diagnosed with AML. The ability of the analogs to activate expression of CYP24A1 gene has been studied in HL60 cell line. The analog PRI-1906 activated expression of CYP24A1 similarly to 1,25D, while PRI-1907 weaker than 1,25D. In addition, the analogs PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 were able to moderately inhibit proliferation and significantly activate expression of CYP24A1 mRNA in prostate cancer cells PC-3.

In this transplantation setting, factors associated with hematopoietic recovery have not been defined completely. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the engraftment in this transplantation setting for patients with leukemia. The study group comprised 104 patients with leukemia who underwent transplantation at a single institution between 2005 and 2008. Factors correlating with neutrophil and platelet engraftment post-transplantation were analyzed retrospectively. All patients achieved an absolute neutrophil count of 500/muL with a mean time of 13.6days (range 8-20days) and a platelet count over 20x10(9)/L with a mean time of 20.2days (range 16-26days). In univariate analysis, donor and age were associated with increased risk of neutrophil engraftment, but their significance was lost upon multivariate analysis. The sex, age, donor, CD34(+) cell dose, conditioning regimen, mismatched locus, ABO mismatched and diagnosis have no effect on platelet engraftment.

We performed a comprehensive study using FISH, G-banding and IHC to identify PAX5 deletion and expression in 102 CD19+ clinical B-ALL cases (79 children and 33 adults) and investigated its relationship with common cytogenetic changes including BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1 and MLL rearrangements, and CDKN2A deletion. The incidences of translocations and deletions were 2.5% and 10.0% in children, and 0.0% and 18.2% in adults, respectively. The incidence of PAX5 deletion was higher than those of BCR-ABL1 (8.9%) or MLL rearrangements (5.1%) in children and than that of MLL rearrangement (3.1%) in adults. Most patients with PAX5 deletion (83.3% of children and 100.0% of adults with PAX5 deletion) had concurrent CDKN2A deletion. PAX5 deletions were detected both in patients with positive and negative PAX5 expression. In this study, we found that PAX5 is a common target in leukemogenesis of B-ALL along with CDKN2A. Owing to its frequent deletion in B-ALL, PAX5 could be used as one of the molecular markers in diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. No correlation between expression of PAX5 and deletion of PAX5 suggests allele-specific regulation.","['Kim, Miyoung', 'Choi, Jung Eun', 'She, Cha Ja', 'Hwang, Sang Mee', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Ahn, Hyo Seop', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Kim, Byoung Kook', 'Park, Myoung Hee', 'Lee, Dong Soon']","['Kim M', 'Choi JE', 'She CJ', 'Hwang SM', 'Shin HY', 'Ahn HS', 'Yoon SS', 'Kim BK', 'Park MH', 'Lee DS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/10/05 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(11)00097-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2011.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2011 Jun 15;47(1):62-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2011.04.003.

There are limited reports of i.v. BU used to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of i.v. BU/cyclophosphamide (CY) conditioning in adult ALL. We retrospectively analyzed 42 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HSCT with BU/CY conditioning between January 2007 and October 2010 with an HLA-matched donor (sibling, n = 18; unrelated, n = 24). Thirty-three patients were in first complete remission (CR1), 2 were in second complete remission (CR2), and 7 were in a more advanced stage. Median patient age was 28 years (range, 17 approximately 55 years). The median follow-up was 15 months (range, 1 approximately 48 months). Overall, 13 patients died, for a 30-month overall survival of 56.5% +/- 10.6% (65.7% +/- 12.5% for patients in CR1 vs 25.4% +/- 15.5% for those in CR2 or beyond; P < .001). Eleven patients experienced relapse between 2 and 26 months after allo-HSCT, with a 30-month relapse rate (RR) of 40% +/- 10.9% (32.0% +/- 12.7% for patients in CR1 vs 71.4% +/- 17.1% for those in CR2 or beyond; P = .001).

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the one-cell embryo is transcriptionally inactive, but at around eight-cell stage transcription is activated in the somatic lineage. This model suggests that histone tail modifications associated with activation of transcription, such as di- or trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me2/me3) should be enriched in the somatic lineage. Here, we have investigated the deposition of H3K4me3 during embryogenesis and found that it is more dynamic than anticipated. In the eight-cell stage embryo, H3K4me3 deposition is poor in the germline blastomere, as expected, but surprisingly three somatic blastomeres also remain poor in H3K4me3. All the other somatic blastomeres show robust deposition of H3K4me3. Interestingly, the three somatic blastomeres poor in H3K4me3 are descendants of the first germline blastomere, implying an activity that impedes on H3K4me3 deposition in these cells. In contrast, the deposition of H3K4me2 and H3K27me2/3 is not lineage restricted. Taken together, our data reveal that H3K4me3 deposition is highly regulated according to the cell lineage involved.","['Wang, Siyao', 'Fisher, Kate', 'Poulin, Gino B']","['Wang S', 'Fisher K', 'Poulin GB']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, Michael Smith Building, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0012-1606(11)00242-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2011 Jul 15;355(2):227-38. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.04.010.

We have previously reported that CD9 was expressed heterogeneously in B-ALL cell lines and CD9(+) cells exhibited an asymmetric cell division with greater tumorigenic potential than CD9(-) cells. CD9(+) cells were also serially transplantable in immunodeficient mice, indicating that CD9(+) cell possess self-renewal capacity. In the current study, we performed more detailed analysis of CD9 function for the cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. In patient sample, CD9 was expressed in the most cases of B-ALL cells with significant correlation of CD34-expression. Gene expression analysis revealed that leukemogenic fusion proteins and Src family proteins were significantly regulated in the CD9(+) population. Moreover, CD9(+) cells exhibited drug-resistance, but proliferation of bulk cells was inhibited by anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody. Knockdown of CD9 remarkably reduced the leukemogenic potential. Furthermore, gene ablation of CD9 affected the expression and tyrosine-phosphorylation of Src family proteins and reduced the expression of histone-deubiquitinase USP22. Taken together, our results suggest that CD9 links to several signaling pathways and epigenetic modification for regulating the CSC properties of B-ALL.","['Yamazaki, Hiroto', 'Xu, C Wilson', 'Naito, Motohiko', 'Nishida, Hiroko', 'Okamoto, Toshihiro', 'Ghani, Farhana Ishrat', 'Iwata, Satoshi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Morimoto, Chikao']","['Yamazaki H', 'Xu CW', 'Naito M', 'Nishida H', 'Okamoto T', 'Ghani FI', 'Iwata S', 'Inukai T', 'Sugita K', 'Morimoto C']","['Division of Clinical Immunology, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)00696-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.098 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 May 27;409(1):14-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.098.

No such studies have been done on CCR7 expression in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-NHL). Our aim in this paper is to investigate the association between CCR7 expression and progression and prognosis of T-NHL. METHODS: 1) Analysis of clinical data: The specimens were obtained from 41 patients with T-NHL and 19 patients with lymphoid hyperplasia. Their corresponding clinicopathologic data were also collected. The expression levels of CCR7, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were examined by immunohistochemical staining. 2) Human T-NHL cell lines Hut 78 (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) and Jurkat (adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma) were cultured. The invasiveness of the two cell lines were measured with a Transwell invasion assay, and then used to study the effects of chemokine receptors on T-NHL invasion and the underlying molecular mechanism. The transcript and expression of CCR7 were evaluated using RT-PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: 1) The higher CCR7 and MMP-9 expression ratios were significantly associated with multiple lesions and higher stage III/IV. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between CCR7 and MMP-9 expression. 2) The Hut 78 cell line was more invasive than the Jurkat cells in the Transwell invasion assay. The transcript and expression levels of CCR7 were significantly higher in Hut78 than that of Jurkat cell line. The T-NHL cell lines were co-cultured with chemokine CCL21 which increased the invasiveness of T-NHL cell. The positive association between CCL21 concentration and invasiveness was found. 3) The stronger transcript and expression of PI(3)K, Akt and p- Akt were also observed in Hut78 than in Jurkat cell line. CONCLUSIONS: High CCR7 expression in T-NHL cells is significantly associated with lymphatic and distant dissemination as well as with tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro. Its underlying mechanism probably involves the PI(3)K/Akt signal pathway.","['Yang, Jing', 'Wang, Shengyi', 'Zhao, Guofan', 'Sun, Baocun']","['Yang J', 'Wang S', 'Zhao G', 'Sun B']","['Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. kesiking@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-30-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-30-51 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2011 May 7;30:51. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-30-51.,10.1186/1756-9966-30-51 [doi],20110507,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcellular Cell Migration']",,PMC3113745,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PPP2R5C is one of the regulatory B subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). It plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. To characterize the expression and distribution of five different transcript variants of the PPP2R5C gene in leukemia, we analyzed the expression level of PPP2R5C in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 77 patients with de novo leukemia, 26 patients with leukemia in complete remission (CR), and 20 healthy individuals by real-time PCR and identified the different variants of PPP2R5C by RT-PCR. FINDINGS: Significantly higher expression of PPP2R5C was found in AML, CML, T-ALL, and B-CLL groups in comparison with healthy controls. High expression of PPP2R5C was detected in the B-ALL group; however, no significant difference was found compared with the healthy group. The expression level of PPP2R5C in the CML-CR group decreased significantly compared with that in the de novo CML group and was not significantly different from the level in the healthy group. By using different primer pairs that covered different exons, five transcript variants of PPP2R5C could be identified.

This is of interest with regard to prostate cancer progression as regulation of steroidogenesis is one of the mechanisms involved in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. In light of this we wanted to investigate the possible involvement of androgen regulation of PBX3 expression in prostate cancer. RESULTS: In this study, we show that PBX3 is post-transcriptionally regulated by androgen in prostate cancer cells and that the effect might be independent of the androgen receptor. Furthermore, PBX3 was identified as a target of Let-7d, an androgen regulated microRNA. Let-7d was down-regulated in malignant compared to benign prostate tissue, whereas up-regulation of PBX3 expression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that PBX3 is up-regulated in prostate cancer and post- transcriptionally regulated by androgen through Let-7d.","['Ramberg, Hakon', 'Alshbib, Ayham', 'Berge, Viktor', 'Svindland, Aud', 'Tasken, Kristin Austlid']","['Ramberg H', 'Alshbib A', 'Berge V', 'Svindland A', 'Tasken KA']","['Faculty Division Aker University Hospital, University of Oslo, Aker, N-0514 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-50 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 May 6;10:50. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-50.,10.1186/1476-4598-10-50 [doi],20110506,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Androgens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Androgen/metabolism']",,PMC3112428,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we demonstrated that p-rES cell lines can be prevented from differentiation via LIF (STAT3) and bFGF2 (MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT) signaling on MEF feeders. High levels of ERK1/2 and AKT activities were crucial for maintaining p-rES cells in an undifferentiated state. Although the p-rES cells under the influence of LIF (500, 1000, and 2000 U/mL) or bFGF2 (5, 10, and 20 ng/mL) alone showed enhanced expression in the pluripotency markers, the highest levels of marker expressions coincided with the simultaneous presence of LIF (1000 U/mL) and bFGF2 (10 ng/mL). The phosphorylation status of LIF and bFGF2 downstream signaling molecules including STAT3, ERK, and AKT was also intensively involved in the maintenance of p-rES cell proliferation and self-renewal. Induced dephosphorylation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and AKT by specific inhibitors caused remarkable losses of self-renewal capacity of p-rES cells.

In contrast, primary leukemias have shown poor susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting the need for sensitizing TRAIL-resistant leukemic cells, by combining soluble recombinant TRAIL either with chemotherapeutic drugs, or with targeted small molecules. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses potential therapeutic applications of combinations able to restore the sensitivity of leukemic cells to either recombinant TRAIL or anti-TRAIL-receptor agonistic antibodies for the treatment of hematological malignancies. EXPERT OPINION: Up-to-date knowledge of the most innovative anti-leukemic therapies including functional screening of specific-sensitizers, enhancing TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Strategies aimed to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, include the combination of novel sensitizers, functionally identified from libraries of pharmaceutically active, synthetic or naturally derived compounds. Other approaches aim to employ the administration of stem cells engineered to express TRAIL, in the leukemic stem cell niche, and promise to be a successful treatment with reduced specific toxicity.","['Zauli, Giorgio', 'Bosco, Raffaella', 'Secchiero, Paola']","['Zauli G', 'Bosco R', 'Secchiero P']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health , IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2011.580278 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2011 Aug;15(8):931-42. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2011.580278.

The drug contains a polycyclic ring system (rings A-D), a glycosidic moiety at C4, and a pendant ring (E-ring) at C1. Interactions between human topoisomerase IIalpha and etoposide in the binary enzyme--drug complex appear to be mediated by substituents on the A-, B-, and E-rings of etoposide. These protein--drug contacts in the binary complex have predictive value for the actions of etoposide within the ternary topoisomerase IIalpha--drug--DNA complex. Although the D-ring of etoposide does not appear to contact topoisomerase IIalpha in the binary complex, etoposide derivatives with modified D-rings display reduced cytotoxicity against murine leukemia cells [Meresse, P., et al. (2003) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 13, 4107]. This finding suggests that alterations in the D-ring may affect etoposide activity toward topoisomerase IIalpha in the ternary enzyme--drug--DNA complex. Therefore, to address the potential contributions of the D-ring to the activity of etoposide, we characterized drug derivatives in which the C13 carbonyl was moved to the C11 position (retroetoposide and retroDEPT) or the D-ring was opened (D-ring diol). All of the D-ring alterations decreased the ability of etoposide to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIalpha in vitro and in cultured cells. They also weakened etoposide binding in the ternary enzyme--drug--DNA complex and altered sites of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the D-ring of etoposide has important interactions with DNA in the ternary topoisomerase II cleavage complex.","['Pitts, Steven L', 'Jablonksy, Michael J', 'Duca, Maria', 'Dauzonne, Daniel', 'Monneret, Claude', 'Arimondo, Paola B', 'Anklin, Clemens', 'Graves, David E', 'Osheroff, Neil']","['Pitts SL', 'Jablonksy MJ', 'Duca M', 'Dauzonne D', 'Monneret C', 'Arimondo PB', 'Anklin C', 'Graves DE', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,2011/05/10 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi200531q [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2011 Jun 7;50(22):5058-66. doi: 10.1021/bi200531q.

However, few genetic factors regulating chondrogenesis of MSCs have been identified. One study showed that zinc-finger protein 145 (ZNF145), a transcription factor, was up-regulated during 3-lineage differentiation of hMSCs. The present study was undertaken to validate whether this novel transcription factor is useful for the repair and regeneration of cartilage. METHODS: Human MSCs were transfected with lentiviral short hairpin RNA (for small interfering RNA knockdown of ZNF145) and a lentiviral vector for overexpression of ZNF145, and the effects of ZNF145 on chondrogenesis were studied using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. Microarray and transient expression analyses were used to determine whether ZNF145 is a factor operating upstream of SOX9. Allogeneic transplantation of hMSCs into osteochondral defects in rats was performed to determine the effects of ZNF145 on repair of cartilage in vivo. RESULTS: Small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing of ZNF145 slowed down chondrogenesis, whereas overexpression of ZNF145 enhanced chondrogenesis. Global gene expression profiling showed up-regulated gene expression in ZNF145-overexpressing MSCs, and transient overexpression of ZNF145 enhanced the expression of SOX9, suggesting that ZNF145 acts as a factor upstream of SOX9, the master regulator of chondrogenesis. Moreover, allogeneic transplantation of hMSCs into osteochondral defects of rat knees showed that ZNF145-overexpressing MSCs repaired cartilage defects better and earlier than empty control MSCs. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ZNF145 gene therapy may be a very useful strategy for improving the quality of cartilage regeneration and repair.","['Liu, Tong Ming', 'Guo, Xi Min', 'Tan, Hwee San', 'Hui, James H', 'Lim, Bing', 'Lee, Eng Hin']","['Liu TM', 'Guo XM', 'Tan HS', 'Hui JH', 'Lim B', 'Lee EH']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National University of Singapore and Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore. dosltm@nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.30430 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2011 Sep;63(9):2711-20. doi: 10.1002/art.30430.,10.1002/art.30430 [doi],,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SOX9 Transcription Factor)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage/*metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chondrocytes/metabolism', 'Chondrogenesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Regeneration/physiology', 'SOX9 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']","['AI-54973/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-047636/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,['Copyright (c) 2011 by the American College of Rheumatology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also observed a concurrent increase in caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, on examining the survival signals expressed during apoptotic induction, we observed that mangiferin caused a remarkable decrease in the nuclear entry of NF-kappaB p65.

In addition, mangiferin suppressed the expressions of Bcl-xL and XIAP; however, we did not note any changes in the levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bim. These results indicate that mangiferin induces apoptosis by suppressing NF-kappaB activation and expressions of Bcl-xL and XAIP. These findings suggest that mangiferin may be useful as an anticancer agent and can be used in combination therapy with other anticancer drugs for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Shoji, Kaori', 'Tsubaki, Masanobu', 'Yamazoe, Yuzuru', 'Satou, Takao', 'Itoh, Tatsuki', 'Kidera, Yasuhiro', 'Tanimori, Yoshihiro', 'Yanae, Masashi', 'Matsuda, Hideaki', 'Taga, Atsushi', 'Nakamura, Haruyuki', 'Nishida, Shozo']","['Shoji K', 'Tsubaki M', 'Yamazoe Y', 'Satou T', 'Itoh T', 'Kidera Y', 'Tanimori Y', 'Yanae M', 'Matsuda H', 'Taga A', 'Nakamura H', 'Nishida S']","['Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/09/08 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2009/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12272-011-0316-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2011 Mar;34(3):469-75. doi: 10.1007/s12272-011-0316-8.

Serum uric acid levels physiologically and gradually rise during human lifetime. Hyperuricemia also arises from excess dietary purine or ethanol intake, decreased renal excretion of uric acid, tumor lysis in lymphoma, leukemia or solid tumors, and sometimes pharmacotherapy. The definition of hyperuricemia is currently arbitrary. Hyperuricemia is associated with chronic kidney disease, arterial hypertension, coronary artery and heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Xanthine oxidase, a hepatic enzyme, catalyzes the production of uric acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species, which potentially damage deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid and proteins, inactivate enzymes, oxidize amino acids and convert poly-unsaturated fatty acids to lipids. This is believed to contribute to atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, renovascular hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Xanthine oxidase inhibition efficiently blocks uric acid generation, and this improves glomerular filtration rates, systemic blood pressure, and cerebro-cardiovascular outcomes.

MTRR is polymorphic at nucleotide 66 (A-to-G) and the resulting variant enzyme has a lower affinity for MTR. The reported associations of MTRR A66G polymorphism with cancer risk are contradictory. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to better assess the associations, including 18,661 cases and 27,678 controls from 35 studies. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between the MTRR A66G polymorphism and cancer risk. The pooled ORs were performed for homozygote model (GG vs. AA), heterozygote model (GG vs. GA), recessive genetic model (GG vs. GA + AA), and dominant genetic model (GG + GA vs. AA), respectively. Overall, results indicated that the G allele and GG variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased cancer risk (G vs. A: OR, 1.039; 95% CI, 1.009-1.078; homozygote model: OR, 1.094; 95% CI, 1.006-1.191).

For stratification analysis, the cancer types with fewer than three studies were categorized into ""other cancers"", and the results indicated that there was a significant elevated cancer risk in ""other cancers"" in all genetic models, not in colorectal cancer, lymphoid leukemia or breast cancer.

Also autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA), although much more frequent in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), has been described in this group of patients. In recent years, among the more traditional therapeutic options, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown interesting results in the treatment of primary AHA. Although this drug has been frequently used for AHA in patients with CLL, much less data are available on its use in NHL patients. However, considering that the main pathogenetic mechanism of AHA in course of lymphoproliferative disorders seems to be an antibody production directly or indirectly mediated by the neoplastic clone, this monoclonal antibody represents an ideal therapeutic approach. In this paper we will briefly describe some biological and clinical features of NHL-patients with AHA.

In a previous paper, we reported that NF-kappaB-dependent IPAS induction by cobalt chloride repressed the hypoxic response in PC12 cells. We found that prolonged incubation under the same conditions caused apoptosis in PC12 cells. Repression of IPAS induction protected cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of IPAS recovered cell viability. EGFP-IPAS protein was localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a large fraction associated with mitochondria. Mitochondrial IPAS induced mitochondria depolarization and caspase-3 activation. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that IPAS is associated with Bcl-x(L), Bcl-w and Mcl-1. The association of IPAS with Bcl-x(L) was also observed in living cells by the FLIM-based FRET analysis, indicating direct binding between the two proteins. IPAS contributed to dysfunction of Bcl-x(L) by inhibiting the interaction of Bcl-x(L) with Bax. These results demonstrate that IPAS functions as a dual function protein involved in transcription repression and apoptosis.","['Torii, S', 'Goto, Y', 'Ishizawa, T', 'Hoshi, H', 'Goryo, K', 'Yasumoto, K', 'Fukumura, H', 'Sogawa, K']","['Torii S', 'Goto Y', 'Ishizawa T', 'Hoshi H', 'Goryo K', 'Yasumoto K', 'Fukumura H', 'Sogawa K']","['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,2011/05/07 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201147 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2011.47 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2011 Nov;18(11):1711-25. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2011.47.

It has been assumed that early relapses derive from a residual population of leukemic cells, which is still present after induction and that relapsed disease will consequently be more resistant to treatment. To test these hypotheses, we performed a prospective study on patients treated according to the frontline-trial ALL-BFM 2000, which used MRD response for risk-group stratification. Patients (n=45) showed a median time to relapse of 1.5 years. In 89% of patients at least one T-cell-receptor/immunoglobulin gene rearrangement chosen for initial MRD quantification remained stable; however, at least one of the preferred markers for MRD stratification at relapse was different to diagnosis in 50% of patients. A similar proportion of very early, early and late relapses appeared to gain a marker at relapse although backtracking-analysis revealed that in 77% of cases, the gained markers were present as small sub-clones at initial diagnosis. Comparing initial and relapse MRD response to induction, 38% of patients showed a similar, 38% a better and 25% a poorer response after relapse. These data demonstrate an unexpectedly high clonal heterogeneity among very early/early relapses and challenge some current assumptions about relapsed ALL.","['Eckert, C', 'Flohr, T', 'Koehler, R', 'Hagedorn, N', 'Moericke, A', 'Stanulla, M', 'Kirschner-Schwabe, R', 'Cario, G', 'Stackelberg, Av', 'Bartram, C R', 'Henze, G', 'Schrappe, M', 'Schrauder, A']","['Eckert C', 'Flohr T', 'Koehler R', 'Hagedorn N', 'Moericke A', 'Stanulla M', 'Kirschner-Schwabe R', 'Cario G', 'Stackelberg A', 'Bartram CR', 'Henze G', 'Schrappe M', 'Schrauder A']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. cornelia.eckert@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201189 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1305-13. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.89.

Here we have investigated whether the CX(3)CR1/CX(3)CL1 axis is involved in the interaction of CLL with their microenvironment. CLL cells from 52 patients expressed surface CX(3)CR1 and CX(3)CL1 and released constitutively soluble CX(3)CL1. One third of these were attracted in vitro by soluble CX(3)CL1. CX(3)CL1-induced phosphorylation of PI3K, Erk1/2, p38, Akt and Src was involved in induction of CLL chemotaxis. Leukemic B cells upregulated CXCR4 upon incubation with CX(3)CL1 and this was paralleled by increased chemotaxis to CXCL12. Akt phosphorylation was involved in CX(3)CL1-induced upregulation of CXCR4 on CLL. In proliferation centers from CLL lymph node and bone marrow, CX(3)CL1 was expressed by CLL cells whereas CX(3)CR1 was detected in CLL and stromal cells. Nurselike cells (NLCs) generated from CLL patient blood co-expressed surface CX(3)CR1 and CX(3)CL1, but did not secrete soluble CX(3)CL1. Only half of NLC cell fractions were attracted in vitro by CX(3)CL1.

Both entities have similar clinical and laboratory presentation, as well as a common genetic determinant, HLA-DR4, indicating they may be part of the same disease spectrum. This review paper seeks to discuss the underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic algorithm of RA, neutropenia and splenomegaly in the spectrum of LGL leukemia and Felty's syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: We hypothesize that there may be a common pathogenic mechanism between LGL leukemia and typical Felty's syndrome. Phenotypic and functional data have strongly suggested that CD3 LGL leukemia is antigen-activated. Aberrations in the T-cell repertoire with the emergence of oligoclonal/clonal lymphoid populations have been found to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of RA. The biologic properties of the pivotal T cell involved in RA pathogenesis are remarkably similar to those in leukemic LGL. SUMMARY: RA-associated T-cell LGL leukemia and articular manifestations of typical Felty's syndrome are not distinguishable. A common pathogenetic link between LGL leukemia and RA is proposed.","['Liu, Xin', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Liu X', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033-0850, USA.

In this study, we investigate the cellular mechanism by which navitoclax (previously called ABT-263), a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, potentiates apoptosis triggered by paclitaxel and an inhibitor of kinesin-5 (K5I, also called a KSP inhibitor), across a panel of epithelial cancer lines. By using time-lapse microscopy, we showed that navitoclax has little effect on cell death during interphase, but strongly accelerates apoptosis during mitotic arrest, and greatly increases the fraction of apoptosis-resistant cells that die. By systematically knocking down individual Bcl-2 proteins, we determined that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are the primary negative regulators of apoptosis during prolonged mitotic arrest. Mcl-1 levels decrease during mitotic arrest because of an imbalance between synthesis and turnover, and turnover depends in part on the MULE/HUWE1 E3 ligase. The combination of Mcl-1 loss with inhibition of Bcl-xL by navitoclax causes rapid apoptosis in all lines tested. Variation in expression levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL largely determines variation in response to antimitotics alone, and antimitotics combined with navitoclax, across our panel. We concluded that Bcl-xL is a critical target of Bcl-2 family inhibitors for enhancing the lethality of antimitotic drugs in epithelial cancers, and combination treatment with navitoclax and a spindle specific antimitotic, such as a K5I, might be more effective than paclitaxel alone.","['Shi, Jue', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Huang, Hsiao-Chun', 'Mitchison, Timothy J']","['Shi J', 'Zhou Y', 'Huang HC', 'Mitchison TJ']","['Center for Quantitative Systems Biology and Department of Physics, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China. jshi@hkbu.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-4336 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4336 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Jul 1;71(13):4518-26. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4336.

In this study, we examined the effect of stromal niche cells on CD34(+) progenitors from patients with FLT3-ITD(+) or wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) AML treated with the TKIs SU5614 or sorafenib. TKIs effectively and specifically inhibited FLT3 and increased the fraction of undivided progenitors in both FLT3-ITD(+) and FLT3-WT samples. Treatment with SU5614 and sorafenib also reduced the number of mature leukemic progenitors, whereas contact with stroma protected against this cell loss. In contrast, primitive long-term progenitors from both FLT3-ITD(+) and FLT3-WT AML were resistant to TKIs. Additional contact with niche cells significantly expanded long-term FLT3-ITD(+) but not FLT3-WT progenitors in the presence of SU5614 but not that of sorafenib. Thus, TKIs with first-generation inhibitors fail to eradicate early leukemic stem/progenitor cells in FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Further, we defined a specific interaction between FLT3-ITD(+) progenitors and niche cells that enables the maintenance of leukemic progenitors in the presence of TKI. Collectively, our findings suggest that molecular therapy may have unpredicted effects on leukemic progenitors, underscoring the necessity of developing strategies to selectively eliminate the malignant stem cell clone.","['Parmar, Amanda', 'Marz, Stefanie', 'Rushton, Sally', 'Holzwarth, Christina', 'Lind, Katarina', 'Kayser, Sabine', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Oostendorp, Robert A J', 'Gotze, Katharina S']","['Parmar A', 'Marz S', 'Rushton S', 'Holzwarth C', 'Lind K', 'Kayser S', 'Dohner K', 'Peschel C', 'Oostendorp RA', 'Gotze KS']","['III Medizinische Klinik, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-4136 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4136 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Jul 1;71(13):4696-706. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4136.

Minimal criteria of tissue involvement to separate small lymphocytic lymphoma from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis have not been defined. DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinicopathological features of 36 patients with extramedullary tissue biopsies containing chronic lymphocytic leukemia-type cells and less than 5x10(9)/L peripheral blood monoclonal B cells. Pathological features (extent and patterns of involvement, architectural preservation, presence of proliferation centers) as well as cytogenetic and radiological findings were examined in relation to clinical outcome. RESULTS: The biopsies were performed to evaluate lymphadenopathy in 20 patients and for other reasons (most frequently staging of a non-hematologic neoplasm) in 16 patients. At latest follow-up (median 23 months), 21 untreated patients had no or stable lymphadenopathy, 3 had regressed lymphadenopathy, and 12 had developed progressive lymphadenopathy and/or received therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Features associated with progression/treatment included lymph nodes 1.5 cm or greater on imaging studies (P=0.01) and presence of proliferation centers in the biopsied tissue (P=0.004). Neither the size nor extent of involvement of the excised lymph node correlated with progression/treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that biopsies containing chronic lymphocytic leukemia-type cells, but lacking proliferation centers and with non-enlarged or only slightly enlarged lymph nodes on imaging, represent a very indolent disease that may best be considered a tissue equivalent of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis rather than overt small lymphocytic lymphoma. We propose that such cases be designated as tissue involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma-like cells of uncertain significance.","['Gibson, Sarah E', 'Swerdlow, Steven H', 'Ferry, Judith A', 'Surti, Urvashi', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Harris, Nancy Lee', 'Hasserjian, Robert P']","['Gibson SE', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Ferry JA', 'Surti U', 'Dal Cin P', 'Harris NL', 'Hasserjian RP']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['Editorial'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.042333 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.042333 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Aug;96(8):1144-52. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.042333.

DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-seven patients from the Leukemia Lymphoma Molecular Profiling Project (training series) and 118 patients from the Catalan Lymphoma-Study group-GELCAB (validation cohort) were included in the study. Microvessels were immunostained with CD31 and quantified with a computerized image analysis system. The stromal scores previously defined in 110 Leukemia Lymphoma Molecular Profiling Project cases were used to analyze correlations with microvessel density data. RESULTS: Microvessel density significantly correlated with the stromal score (r=0.3209; P<0.001). Patients with high microvessel density showed significantly poorer overall survival than those with low microvessel density both in the training series (4-year OS 54% vs. 78%; P=0.004) and in the validation cohort (57% vs. 81%; P=0.006). In multivariate analysis, in both groups high microvessel density was a statistically significant unfavorable prognostic factor independent of international prognostic index [training series: international prognostic index (relative risk 2.7; P=0.003); microvessel density (relative risk 1.96; P=0.002); validation cohort: international prognostic index (relative risk 4.74; P<0.001); microvessel density (relative risk 2.4; P=0.016)]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the impact of angiogenesis in the outcome of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and the interest of evaluating antiangiogenic drugs in clinical trials.","['Cardesa-Salzmann, Teresa M', 'Colomo, Luis', 'Gutierrez, Gonzalo', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Weisenburger, Dennis', 'Climent, Fina', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Mercadal, Santiago', 'Arenillas, Leonor', 'Serrano, Sergio', 'Tubbs, Ray', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Mate, Jose L', 'Rimsza, Lisa', 'Braziel, Rita', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Wright, George', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Staudt, Louis', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Campo, Elias']","['Cardesa-Salzmann TM', 'Colomo L', 'Gutierrez G', 'Chan WC', 'Weisenburger D', 'Climent F', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Mercadal S', 'Arenillas L', 'Serrano S', 'Tubbs R', 'Delabie J', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Connors JM', 'Mate JL', 'Rimsza L', 'Braziel R', 'Rosenwald A', 'Lenz G', 'Wright G', 'Jaffe ES', 'Staudt L', 'Jares P', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Campo E']","['Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/10/27 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.037408 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.037408 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Jul;96(7):996-1001. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.037408.

Adoptive transfer of in-vitro generated donor T cells with specific anti-leukemic or pathogen-specific activity may be effective. However, in many cases this requires the in-vitro priming and expansion of antigen-specific precursor T cells from the naive donor T-cell repertoire. DESIGN AND METHODS: Antigen-specific CD8 T cells were generated by co-culture of CD45RO-depleted, regulatory T cell-depleted donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells with autologous peptide-loaded dendritic cells, followed by two re-stimulations with peptide-loaded autologous monocytes. Responding T cells were isolated based on CD137 expression and further purified using peptide/major histocompatibility complex tetramers. RESULTS: Using this method we were able to reproducibly generate functionally high avidity T cells directed against multiple viral antigens and minor histocompatibility antigens from the naive T-cell repertoire of seronegative, minor histocompatibility antigen-negative donors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that reduction of the regulatory T-cell frequency by depletion of CD45RO(+) responder cells resulted in improved priming and expansion of antigen-specific precursor T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we present a robust method for the in-vitro induction and isolation of antigen-specific T cells from the naive repertoire. We demonstrate that the likelihood of successful generation of primary immune responses is determined by a delicate balance between the numbers of antigen-specific precursor T cells and the numbers and activation state of regulatory T cells locally at the site of priming of the immune response.","['Jedema, Inge', 'van de Meent, Marian', 'Pots, Jeanette', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'van der Beek, Martha T', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Jedema I', 'van de Meent M', 'Pots J', 'Kester MG', 'van der Beek MT', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Dept. of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. i.jedema@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.039099 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.039099 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Aug;96(8):1204-12. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.039099.

We aimed to assess whether leukemia-free survival is an acceptable statistical surrogate for overall survival when applied to remission maintenance therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from a randomized Phase III trial of remission maintenance immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride plus low-dose interleukin-2 versus no treatment in adults with acute myeloid leukemia. A two-stage surrogate validation model was applied in which correlations between Kaplan-Meier estimates of leukemia-free survival and overall survival, and between log hazard ratios reflecting treatment effects were analyzed. Country of patient enrollment was the unit of analysis. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 36, 48, and 60 months and leukemia-free survival at 24 months were reasonably correlated (R(2) ranging from 0.44 to 0.84) both for the overall (n=320) and first complete remission (n=261) populations. The effects of histamine dihydrochloride/interleukin-2 on log hazard ratios for leukemia-free survival and overall survival were well correlated (R(2)=0.88-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The significant correlations between overall survival and the surrogate end point (leukemia-free survival) and between the effect of histamine dihydrochloride/interleukin-2 on leukemia-free survival and overall survival satisfy the two-stage surrogate validation model.","['Buyse, Marc', 'Michiels, Stefan', 'Squifflet, Pierre', 'Lucchesi, Kathryn J', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer', 'Brune, Mats L', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Buyse M', 'Michiels S', 'Squifflet P', 'Lucchesi KJ', 'Hellstrand K', 'Brune ML', 'Castaigne S', 'Rowe JM']","['International Drug Development Institute, 30 Avenue Provinciale, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. marc.buyse@iddi.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.039131 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.039131 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Aug;96(8):1106-12. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.039131.

Moreover, comparison of genomic profiles from sequential patients' samples allows detection of clonal evolution. DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened samples from 369 patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia from a population-based cohort using 250K single nucleotide polymorphism-arrays. Clonal evolution was evaluated in 59 follow-up samples obtained after 5-9 years. RESULTS: At diagnosis, copy-number aberrations were identified in 90% of patients; 70% carried known recurrent alterations, including del(13q) (55%), trisomy 12 (10.5%), del(11q) (10%), and del(17p) (4%). Additional recurrent aberrations were detected on chromosomes 2 (1.9%), 4 (1.4%), 8 (1.6%) and 14 (1.6%). Thirteen patients (3.5%) displayed recurrent copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity on 13q, of whom 11 had concurrent homozygous del(13q). Genomic complexity and large 13q deletions correlated with inferior outcome, while the former was linked to poor-prognostic aberrations. In the follow-up study, clonal evolution developed in 8/24 (33%) patients with unmutated IGHV, and in 4/25 (16%) IGHV-mutated and treated patients. In contrast, untreated patients with mutated IGHV (n=10) did not acquire additional aberrations. The most common secondary event, del(13q), was detected in 6/12 (50%) of all patients with acquired alterations. Interestingly, aberrations on, for example, chromosome 6q, 8p, 9p and 10q developed exclusively in patients with unmutated IGHV. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-genome screening revealed a high frequency of genomic aberrations in newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clonal evolution was associated with other markers of aggressive disease and commonly included the known recurrent aberrations.","['Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Goransson, Hanna', 'Cahill, Nicola', 'Jansson, Mattias', 'Rasmussen, Markus', 'Lundin, Jeanette', 'Norin, Stefan', 'Buhl, Anne Mette', 'Smedby, Karin Ekstrom', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Geisler, Christian', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Gunnarsson R', 'Mansouri L', 'Isaksson A', 'Goransson H', 'Cahill N', 'Jansson M', 'Rasmussen M', 'Lundin J', 'Norin S', 'Buhl AM', 'Smedby KE', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Karlsson K', 'Jurlander J', 'Geisler C', 'Juliusson G', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. rebeqa.gunnarsson@igp.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.039768 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.039768 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Aug;96(8):1161-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.039768.

A disadvantage of cord blood is its low cell content which limits cord blood transplantation to generally low weight recipients, such as children. Various alternatives have been used to overcome this limitation, including co-infusion of two partially HLA-matched cord blood units. According to Eurocord Registry data, this strategy has been applied in approximately 993 adult patients with hematologic diseases since the first double umbilical cord blood transplantation in 1999. In fact, since 2005, the number of adult patients receiving double umbilical cord blood transplantation has surpassed the number of adults transplanted with single cord blood units. The engraftment rate is comparable for both single and double umbilical cord blood transplantation, although the latter is accompanied by a higher incidence of grade II acute graft-versus-host disease and lower leukemia relapse for patients in first complete remission. In the majority of patients undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation, transient chimerism, due to the presence of cells from both donor units early post transplant, is replaced by sustained dominance of one unit from which long-term hematopoiesis is derived. Although the biology and the factors that determine unit dominance have not been clarified, the implication of immune-mediated mechanisms has been reported. Preliminary data have demonstrated the safety of double umbilical cord blood transplantation. Ongoing clinical trials and prolonged follow up of the patients will clarify the immunology and determine the efficacy of this approach. We present here a brief overview of the clinical experience on double umbilical cord blood transplantation and its underlying biology.","['Sideri, Anastasia', 'Neokleous, Nikolaos', 'Brunet De La Grange, Philippe', 'Guerton, Bernadette', 'Le Bousse Kerdilles, Marie-Caroline', 'Uzan, Georges', 'Peste-Tsilimidos, Corina', 'Gluckman, Eliane']","['Sideri A', 'Neokleous N', 'Brunet De La Grange P', 'Guerton B', 'Le Bousse Kerdilles MC', 'Uzan G', 'Peste-Tsilimidos C', 'Gluckman E']","['Stem-Health Hellas, Hygeia Hospital, 4 Er.

These effects resemble those of ethanol consumption, both with respect to behavioral effects and neurological mechanisms. These observations, along with the extensive data on the relationship between ethanol consumption and fatal automobile accidents, suggested a way to estimate the probability of fatal automobile accidents from solvent inhalation. The problem can be approached using the logic of the algebraic transitive postulate of equality: if A=B and B=C, then A=C. We first calculated a function describing the internal doses of solvent vapors that cause the same magnitude of behavioral impairment as ingestion of ethanol (A=B). Next, we fit a function to data from the literature describing the probability of fatal car crashes for a given internal dose of ethanol (B=C). Finally, we used these two functions to generate a third function to estimate the probability of a fatal car crash for any internal dose of organic solvent vapor (A=C). This latter function showed quantitatively (1) that the likelihood of a fatal car crash is increased by acute exposure to organic solvent vapors at concentrations less than 1.0 ppm, and (2) that this likelihood is similar in magnitude to the probability of developing leukemia from exposure to benzene. This approach could also be applied to other potentially adverse consequences of acute exposure to solvents (e.g., nonfatal car crashes, property damage, and workplace accidents), if appropriate data were available.","['Benignus, Vernon A', 'Bushnell, Philip J', 'Boyes, William K']","['Benignus VA', 'Bushnell PJ', 'Boyes WK']","['Integrated Systems Toxicology Division, Systems Biology Branch, Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA. vbenignus.@earthlink.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,2011/05/07 06:00,2012/03/02 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01622.x [doi]'],ppublish,Risk Anal. 2011 Dec;31(12):1935-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01622.x.

So far, only few studies have investigated the effectiveness of physical activity over the entire inpatient phase of an allogeneic HSCT. PURPOSE: We performed a randomized controlled study to examine the influence of a controlled moderate exercise program starting parallel to chemotherapeutic conditioning and total body irradiation on the patient's physical and psychological constitution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients undergoing an allogeneic HSCT were randomly assigned to an exercise group (EG) or a control group (CG). While the EG took part in an endurance and activity of daily living-training twice a day, the CG received the clinic's standard physiotherapy program once a day. RESULTS: Significant differences and/or trends in favor of the EG were observed regarding the primary endpoint endurance performance (P=0.002), muscular strength (P=0.022), fatigue (P=0.046), and emotional state (P=0.028) without posing an additional risk for the individual. CONCLUSION: The results show that the training program is feasible and seems to have positive influences on physical performance and quality of life in patients undergoing an allogeneic HSCT.

Our objectives were to investigate the distribution of specific TPMT and ITPA genotypes in healthy subjects and patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) from the three main ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese and Indians) in Malaysia and the association of the polymorphisms with adverse effects of 6-MP. METHODS: Patients with ALL and healthy controls were recruited and genotyped for genetic variants of TPMT and ITPA 94C>A. The relationship between genotypes and clinical outcomes was investigated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients with allele ITPA 94A were more likely to develop fever and liver toxicity with 6-MP. The prevalence of TPMT variants was low and this makes it unlikely that testing for them would be useful in our populations. Only patients heterozygous for TPMT*3C were detected. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ITPA 94C>A testing, but not TPMT testing, may help in minimizing the adverse effects of 6-MP in Malaysian patients. However, whether this is true in clinical practice requires a larger study and formal randomized controlled evaluation.","['Wan Rosalina, W R', 'Teh, L K', 'Mohamad, N', 'Nasir, A', 'Yusoff, R', 'Baba, A A', 'Salleh, M Z']","['Wan Rosalina WR', 'Teh LK', 'Mohamad N', 'Nasir A', 'Yusoff R', 'Baba AA', 'Salleh MZ']","['Pharmacogenomics Center (PROMISE), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,2011/05/07 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2710.2011.01272.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2012 Apr;37(2):237-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2710.2011.01272.x.

Monitoring of WT1 expression in PB and CD34(+) donor chimerism of BM predicts early relapse in AML and MDS patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning. Leukemia 25, 498-505 (2011). Early detection of relapse is critical for patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), since therapy can be initiated while disease burden remains low. As these neoplasms represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies with distinct underlying mutations, no single genetic marker exists that both defines AML/MDS and can be exploited for sensitive detection of neoplastic cells prior to overt hematologic relapse. Conversely, the Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) expression level is increased in blasts of most AML/MDS patients, and quantitative analysis of WT1 expression has been used to predict relapse following myeloablative HSCT. In this article, we review a recently published study evaluating the usefulness of multiple markers, including WT1 expression, for predicting relapse in AML/MDS patients following reduced-intensity conditioning nonmyeloablative HSCT.","['Wertheim, Gerald B', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Wertheim GB', 'Bagg A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 7103 Founders Pavilion, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4283, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,2011/05/07 06:00,2011/05/07 06:01,['2011/05/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1586/erm.11.19 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2011 May;11(4):361-6. doi: 10.1586/erm.11.19.,10.1586/erm.11.19 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2011 Mar;25(3):498-505.

However, it has been demonstrated that this long-term treatment is associated with altered bone metabolism. The mechanisms of this effect are not fully understood, but an inhibition of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) beta axis has been suspected on the basis of some in vitro findings. We evaluated the osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (hBM-MSCs) after in vitro treatment with dasatinib, nilotinib or bosutinib. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were induced to differentiate in osteoblastic cells by treatment with osteogenic medium with or without dasatinib, nilotinib or bosutinib. We found that the addition of dasatinib, and to a greater extend nilotinib, induced expression of osteogenic mRNA markers as compared with cultures with standard medium or osteogenic medium only. However, treatment with bosutinib did not induce an increase of osteogenic markers. In conclusion, we show that besides imatinib, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib and nilotinib, but not bosutinib, increase osteogenic markers in hBM-MSCs. Because bosutinib differs from the other TKIs because of its low affinity to other kinases such as PDGF-R, these experiments suggest that inhibition of PDGF-R may be involved in the induction of osteoblastogenesis by TKIs.","['Tibullo, Daniele', 'Barbagallo, Ignazio', 'Giallongo, Cesarina', 'La Cava, Piera', 'Branca, Antonio', 'Conticello, Concetta', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe A', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Tibullo D', 'Barbagallo I', 'Giallongo C', 'La Cava P', 'Branca A', 'Conticello C', 'Stagno F', 'Chiarenza A', 'Palumbo GA', 'Di Raimondo F']","['Department of Clinical and Molecular Biomedicine, Division of Hematology, Ospedale Ferrarotto, University of Catania, Catania, Italy. d.tibullo@unict.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,2011/05/06 06:00,2012/07/03 06:00,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.988 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Mar;30(1):27-33. doi: 10.1002/hon.988.

Here, we investigated the radioprotective effects of fucoidan on human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937. Further, animal tests were carried out using Balb/c mice in order to determine the radiation-induced changes in the counts of blood cells, including thrombocytes, erythrocytes, leukocytes and hematocrit. Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, wherein fucoidan (1, 10, and 100 mug/mL) was observed to improve recovery from damage caused by 8-Gy radiation in a dose dependent manner. The viability of U937 cells pre-treated with fucoidan also increased in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, fucoidan at 100 mg/kg was found to protect against changes in the counts of blood cells as follows: on day 28 after irradiation, the thrombocyte count in the irradiated controls decreased to 45% compared with the non-irradiated controls, while that in the fucoidan-treated group was 60%. The hematocrit in the fucoidan-treated group recovered to 75% on day 28, while that in the irradiated control was 68%. The erythrocyte count in the irradiated controls consistently ranged from 64% to 67% throughout the experiment, but that in the fucoidan-treated group increased gradually, ranging from 75% to 80%. The mean number of survival days and 50-day actuarial survival rate increased dose dependently in the fucoidan-treated group. The mean number of survival days and the 50-day actuarial survival rate in this group was 16, 21, and 29 days and 12%, 20%, and 30% at fucoidan doses of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg. The values of these parameters in the control group were 9 days and 0%, although the difference between the test and control groups was not statistically significant.

The resistance selected against one DBA/2 derived malignant tumor (ESb) extended to other DBA/2 malignant tumors (SL 2, MDAY-D2) and was thus of more general significance. Since tumor resistance had an immunological basis and since the two parental strains differed in multiple minor histocompatibility antigens (H) as well as in viral superantigens (vSAGs) we determined specificities of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro. All CTL responses from tumor resistant strains showed not only antitumor reactivity but also rather strong anti-minor H reactivity. There was no relationship between cytolysis and the DBA/2 type vSAG-7 (Mls(a)) expression. We also tested the capacity of immune cells from 7 resistant lines to transfer graft versus leukemia and graft versus host reactivity to ESb tumor bearing DBA/2 mice. Immune cells from one subline were capable of transfering complete protection without development of chronic GVH over a period of 4 months. The resistant parental line B10.D2 and most of the other sublines also were able to transfer GvL reactivity but this was usually associated later with chronic GVH disease caused mortality. These results demonstrate the potential of this genetic approach to separate GvL from GvH reactivity.","['Schirrmacher, V', 'Griesbach, A', 'Gehring, M', 'Lehr, B']","['Schirrmacher V', 'Griesbach A', 'Gehring M', 'Lehr B']","['GERMAN CANC RES CTR,TUMORIMMUNOL PROGRAM,DIV CELLULAR IMMUNOL,W-6900 HEIDELBERG,GERMANY.

The objective of this study was to describe the monetary costs borne by families of patients with childhood cancer and to determine whether these costs represent an important component of the burden of illness. Families completed a prospective diary survey about daily expenses incurred during each sample week of therapy. We also undertook a retrospective, cross-sectional questionnaire survey about expenses, incurred during the entire duration of treatment, associated with major or one-time cost items. Seventy families of children treated for high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 19 families of children treated for Wilms' tumor stages 2-5, and 16 families of children treated for neuroblastoma stages 3 and 4 completed diaries or questionnaires detailing the costs resulting from the diseases and their treatment. The mean total expenses (in 1986 Canadian dollars) incurred by families of childhood cancer patients over the entire course of therapy are $26,070 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia? $20,074 for Wilms' tumour, and $10,376 for neuroblastoma. On-going weekly costs rather than major one-time purchases account for the largest share of expenses. Overall, in spite of universal first dollar coverage for medical care in Canada, family-borne costs during the course of these illnesses are at least one-third of the average family's after-tax income.","['Barr, R', 'Furlong, W', 'Horsman, J', 'Feeny, D', 'Torrance, G', 'Weitzman, S']","['Barr R', 'Furlong W', 'Horsman J', 'Feeny D', 'Torrance G', 'Weitzman S']","['MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT PEDIAT,HAMILTON,ON,CANADA.

Suppression of BCR/ABL hybrid gene expression can be a valuable tool for leukemic cell purging. Antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs) have the capacity to specifically downregulate gene expression. Data reported on the effect they have on BCR/ABL hybrid gene expression are controversial. We present data illustrating that prolongation of ODN half-life by means of chemical or sequence modification has only limited specific growth suppressive effect on BCR/ABL-positive clonogenic cells in vitro. Compared to unmodified phosphodiester ODNs (PO-ODNs) spanning the BCR/ABL junctions, modified ODNs with either a 3'-GC-clamp (GC-ODNs) or ODNs with one 3'-inverted nucleotide (3'-3' ODNs) to prevent 3'-exonuclease degradation, showed significantly prolonged extra- and intracellular half lives and different subcellular distributions in CML cell lines. In clonogenic assays from patients with CML, the modified ODNs were to some extent able to reduce colonies expressing BCR/ABL (GC-ODNs >3'-3'-ODNs >PO-ODNs). This difference did not become significant statistically. We demonstrate a substantially diminished hybridization efficacy of the modified antisense ODNs used, which may serve as a possible explanation for the failure to augment the leukemic cell purging efficacy.","['Kaebisch, A', 'Seay, U', 'Wicker, S', 'Weber, C', 'Lohmeyer, J', 'Ortigao, J', 'Pralle, H']","['Kaebisch A', 'Seay U', 'Wicker S', 'Weber C', 'Lohmeyer J', 'Ortigao J', 'Pralle H']","['UNIV ULM,SEKT POLYMERE,D-89081 ULM,GERMANY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.8.5.859 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1996 May;8(5):859-64. doi: 10.3892/ijo.8.5.859.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPA suppressed the growth of OCI/AML-1 and OCI/AML-5 cells but stimulated the proliferation of OCI/AML-4 cells. TPA differentiated OCI/AML-4 and OCI/AML-5 cells to macrophage-like cells. dbcAMP suppressed the growth of the three without differentiation. The stimulation of TPA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of some proteins in OCI/AML-4 and OCI/AML-5 cells. Their molecular weights were the same as those phosphorylated by hematopoietic factors. The patterns of phosphorylated proteins were different between the two. TPA induced the phosphorylation of MAP kinase, but not that of JAK2 protein in three cell lines. The stimulation of dbcAMP did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation in three cell lines. Overnight exposure of TPA inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by hematopoietic factors, although that of dbcAMP did not.

Cell cycle arrest and events associated with cell death were followed in etoposide treated L1210 cells under conditions in which DNP reduced cytotoxicity greater than 100-fold. Micronucleation, associated with mitotic catastrophe, and apoptotic internucleosomal degradation of DNA, were both inhibited by DNP co-treatment to an extent consistent with clonogenic survival. However, the ability of etoposide to cause cell cycle arrest was minimally affected by DNP. For the same proportion of cells arresting in G(2), DNP co-treatment profoundly reduced etoposide cytotoxicity, suggesting a separation between etoposide-induced G(2) arrest and cell death. At the same concentration used to treat L1210 cells, DNP was unable to abrogate etoposide cytotoxicity in HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary or HL60 cells. The relationship between ongoing macromolecular synthesis during etoposide treatment and clonogenic survival was further studied in L1210 and HeLa cells. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive than HeLa cells to inhibition of macromolecular synthesis by DNP. A higher DNP concentration did partially block etoposide cytotoxicity in HeLa cells, in association with increased inhibition of macromolecular synthesis. It was not possible to attribute the reduced cytotoxicity of etoposide in HeLa cells to inhibition of DNA or RNA synthesis alone, because inhibitors with greater specificity (aphidicolin and DRB) had no effect on clonogenic survival. However, aphidicolin partially abrogated etoposide cytotoxicity in L1210 cells, although to a lesser extent than DNP. These data indicate that inhibition of DNA or RNA synthesis alone during etoposide exposure is insufficient to abrogate killing of HeLa cells, that inhibition of etoposide cytotoxicity in HeLa cells may require the additional inhibition of protein synthesis, and that the modulating effects of ongoing DNA synthesis on etoposide cytotoxicity are cell line dependent.","['Lock, R', 'Thompson, B', 'Stribinskiene, L']","['Lock R', 'Thompson B', 'Stribinskiene L']","['UNIV LOUISVILLE,JAMES GRAHAM BROWN CANC CTR,HENRY VOGT CANC RES INST,DEPT BIOCHEM,LOUISVILLE,KY 40292.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.8.2.305 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1996 Feb;8(2):305-11. doi: 10.3892/ijo.8.2.305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic deregulation of miRs is implicated in carcinogenesis. Promoter DNA methylation and histone modification of miR-124-1 was studied in 5 normal marrow controls, 4 lymphoma, 8 multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines, 230 diagnostic primary samples of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), MM, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and 53 MM samples at stable disease or relapse. Promoter of miR-124-1 was unmethylated in normal controls but homozygously methylated in 4 of 4 lymphoma and 4 of 8 myeloma cell lines. Treatment of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine led to miR-124-1 demethylation and re-expression of mature miR-124, which also associated with emergence of euchromatic trimethyl H3K4 and consequent downregulation of CDK6 in myeloma cells harboring homozygous miR-124-1 methylation. In primary samples at diagnosis, miR-124-1 methylation was absent in CML but detected in 2% each of MM at diagnosis and relapse/progression, 5% ALL, 15% AML, 14% CLL and 58.1% of NHL (p<0.001). Amongst lymphoid malignancies, miR-124-1 was preferentially methylated in NHL than MM, CLL or ALL. In primary lymphoma samples, miR-124-1 was preferentially hypermethylated in B- or NK/T-cell lymphomas and associated with reduced miR-124 expression. In conclusion, miR-124-1 was hypermethylated in a tumour-specific manner, with a heterochromatic histone configuration. Hypomethylation led to partial restoration of euchromatic histone code and miR re-expression. Infrequent miR-124-1 methylation detected in diagnostic and relapse MM samples showed an unimportant role in MM pathogenesis, despite frequent methylation found in cell lines. Amongst haematological cancers, miR-124-1 was more frequently hypermethylated in NHL, and hence warrants further study.","['Wong, Kwan Yeung', 'So, Chi Chiu', 'Loong, Florence', 'Chung, Lap Ping', 'Lam, William Wai Lung', 'Liang, Raymond', 'Li, George Kam Hop', 'Jin, Dong-Yan', 'Chim, Chor Sang']","['Wong KY', 'So CC', 'Loong F', 'Chung LP', 'Lam WW', 'Liang R', 'Li GK', 'Jin DY', 'Chim CS']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/05/06 06:00,2011/08/27 06:00,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2010/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0019027 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Apr 22;6(4):e19027. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019027.,10.1371/journal.pone.0019027 [doi],20110422,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MIRN124 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Male', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",,PMC3081325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cardiac infiltration in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome is extremely rare, especially in the absence of bone marrow involvement by blasts. The recognition of this entity is becoming increasingly important as the incidence of cardiac myeloid sarcoma may be on the rise as the number of patients receiving chemotherapy increases.","['Matkowskyj, Kristina A', 'Wiseman, William R', 'Robin, Jason C', 'Norvell, John P', 'Puthumana, Jyothy', 'Nelson, Beverly', 'Peterson, Loann', 'McGarry, Thomas J', 'Tourtellotte, Warren G']","['Matkowskyj KA', 'Wiseman WR', 'Robin JC', 'Norvell JP', 'Puthumana J', 'Nelson B', 'Peterson L', 'McGarry TJ', 'Tourtellotte WG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Hematop,Journal of hematopathology,101491976,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2009/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12308-010-0058-4 [doi]'],epublish,J Hematop. 2010 May 5;3(1):41-6. doi: 10.1007/s12308-010-0058-4.,10.1007/s12308-010-0058-4 [doi],20100505,,,,['K26 OD010945/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2883902,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia cordis', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'Rapidly progressive heart failure', 'Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,

Busulfan dosing is complex due to wide interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics and a narrow therapeutic range. Although busulfan dose is normalized to body weight, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) using area under the plasma concentration curve is recommended after the first dose. A high busulfan area under the plasma concentration curve (>1500 muM.min) is associated with an increased risk for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and a suboptimal area under the plasma concentration curve (<900 muM.min) is associated with an increased risk for graft rejection or disease relapse. TDM of busulfan is not widely available due to the lack of commercially available and rapid methods to determine the area under the plasma concentration curve. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Roche cobas c 111 instrument, a photometric automated chemistry analyzer, using the Busulfan PCM assay from Saladax Biomedical Inc. The assay using this instrument was compared with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Saladax Biomedical Inc and the Olympus AU400e. Linearity and accuracy were evaluated between 175 and 1750 ng/mL. Imprecision was determined by analyzing 5 concentrations of standards twice a day for 20 days. RESULTS: Linearity for the Roche method had a slope and y-intercept of 1.050 and -5.5, respectively, and percent recovery ranged between 95% and 105%. Correlation between the Roche and ELISA platforms was analyzed by linear regression on 26 frozen patient samples. The results from the comparison of the methods based on the Roche and ELISA platforms were as follows: coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.9684, with a slope and y-intercept of 0.752 and 108.41, respectively. Correlation between the Roche and Olympus instruments was analyzed by linear regression and Bland-Altman plots. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.9942, with a slope and y-intercept of 1.035 and -41.3326, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of TDM of busulfan can be improved by the use of commercially available reagents and automated platforms.","['Juenke, JoEtta M', 'Miller, Kendall A', 'McMillin, Gwendolyn A', 'Johnson-Davis, Kamisha L']","['Juenke JM', 'Miller KA', 'McMillin GA', 'Johnson-Davis KL']","['ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT 84108-1221, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,2011/05/06 06:00,2011/09/15 06:00,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e318214cd75 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2011 Jun;33(3):315-20. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e318214cd75.,10.1097/FTD.0b013e318214cd75 [doi],,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Area Under Curve', 'Automation, Laboratory/instrumentation/*methods', 'Blood Chemical Analysis/instrumentation/*methods', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Statistics as Topic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shares these receptors with the closely related TNF family member, B-cell activating factor (BAFF). Contrary to BAFF, APRIL binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which regulates cross-linking of APRIL and efficient signaling. APRIL was originally identified as a growth promoter of solid tumors, and more recent evidence defines APRIL also as an important survival factor in several human B-cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To target APRIL therapeutically, we developed two anti-human APRIL antibodies (hAPRIL.01A and hAPRIL.03A) that block APRIL binding to BCMA and TACI. Their antagonistic properties are unique when compared with a series of commercially available monoclonal anti-human APRIL antibodies as they prevent in vitro proliferation and IgA production of APRIL-reactive B cells. In addition, they effectively impair the CLL-like phenotype of aging APRIL transgenic mice and, more importantly, block APRIL binding to human B-cell lymphomas and prevent the survival effect induced by APRIL. We therefore conclude that these antibodies have potential for further development as therapeutics to target APRIL-dependent survival in B-cell malignancies.","['Guadagnoli, Marco', 'Kimberley, Fiona C', 'Phan, Uyen', 'Cameron, Katherine', 'Vink, Paul M', 'Rodermond, Hans', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'van Eenennaam, Hans', 'Medema, Jan Paul']","['Guadagnoli M', 'Kimberley FC', 'Phan U', 'Cameron K', 'Vink PM', 'Rodermond H', 'Eldering E', 'Kater AP', 'van Eenennaam H', 'Medema JP']","['Laboratory of Experimental Oncology and Radiobiology (LEXOR), Center for Experimental Molecular Medicine, Academic Medical Center (AMC), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/05/06 06:00,2011/09/06 06:00,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44881-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-330852 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 23;117(25):6856-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-330852.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mailed questionnaires were completed between 1994 and 1997 in eight Canadian provinces by 1182 incident histologically confirmed cases of the stomach, 1727 of the colon, 1447 of the rectum, 628 of the pancreas, 3341 of the lung, 2362 of the breast, 442 of the ovary, 1799 of the prostate, 686 of the testis, 1345 of the kidney, 1029 of the bladder, 1009 of the brain, 1666 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), 1069 leukemia and 5039 population controls. Information on dietary habits and nutrition intake were obtained using a food frequency questionnaire, which provided data on eating habits 2 years before the study. Odds ratios (ORs) were derived by unconditional logistic regression to adjust for total energy intake and other potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Dietary cholesterol was positively associated with the risk of cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, breast (mainly postmenopausal), kidney, bladder and NHL: the ORs for the highest versus the lowest quartile ranged from 1.4 to 1.7. In contrast, cholesterol intake was inversely associated with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings add to the evidence that high cholesterol intake is linked to increased risk of various cancers. A diet low in cholesterol may play a role in the prevention of several cancers.","['Hu, J', 'La Vecchia, C', 'de Groh, M', 'Negri, E', 'Morrison, H', 'Mery, L']","['Hu J', 'La Vecchia C', 'de Groh M', 'Negri E', 'Morrison H', 'Mery L']","['Science Integration Division, Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Canada.

Attempts to treat CFS have been largely ineffective primarily because the etiology of the disorder is unknown. Recently, CFS has been associated with xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) as well as other murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related viruses, though not all studies have found these associations. We collected blood samples from 100 CFS patients and 200 self-reported healthy volunteers from the same geographical area. We analyzed these in a blind manner using molecular, serological, and viral replication assays. We also analyzed samples from patients in the original study that reported XMRV in CFS patients. We did not find XMRV or related MLVs either as viral sequences or infectious viruses, nor did we find antibodies to these viruses in any of the patient samples, including those from the original study. We show that at least some of the discrepancy with previous studies is due to the presence of trace amounts of mouse DNA in the Taq polymerase enzymes used in these previous studies. Our findings do not support an association between CFS and MLV-related viruses, including XMRV, and the off-label use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of CFS does not seem justified at present.","['Shin, Clifford H', 'Bateman, Lucinda', 'Schlaberg, Robert', 'Bunker, Ashley M', 'Leonard, Christopher J', 'Hughen, Ronald W', 'Light, Alan R', 'Light, Kathleen C', 'Singh, Ila R']","['Shin CH', 'Bateman L', 'Schlaberg R', 'Bunker AM', 'Leonard CJ', 'Hughen RW', 'Light AR', 'Light KC', 'Singh IR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah, 15 North Medical Drive East, Suite 2100, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2011/05/06 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00693-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00693-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Jul;85(14):7195-202. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00693-11.

METHODS: A literature search on Scopulariopsis sinonasal invasive infections was performed and clinical data including age, gender, co-morbidities, treatment and prognosis was collected on all the patients. RESULTS: A 17 years old boy with acute myelocytic leukemia and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis sinonasal infection was successfully treated at our department with a combination of extensive surgical debridement and antifungal antibiotics. We found six articled describing six patients with AIFS due to Scopulariopsis species. Four patients were adults and two were children, 3 males and 3 females. Two had an infection with Scopulariopsis acremoium, one with Scopulariopsis candida and for 3 patients no data was given on the specific Scopulariopsis species. All the patients except one were immunocompromized. One patient was treated with antifungal drugs, 2 with surgery and 4 patients received antifungals and were operated. One patient died due to the fungal infection and two patients died due to other causes. CONCLUSIONS: Scopulariopsis AIFS is a life threatening disease affecting mainly immunocompromized patients, both children and adults. No clear treatment regimen has been established yet.

Every human embryonic stem cell line has its own genetic background, which determines its specific ability for differentiation as well as susceptibility to drugs. It is necessary to compile many human embryonic stem cell lines with various backgrounds for future clinical use, especially in China due to its large population. This study contributes to isolating new Chinese human embryonic stem cell lines with clarified directly differentiation ability. METHODS: Donated embryos that exceeded clinical use in our in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) center were collected to establish human embryonic stem cells lines with informed consent. The classic growth factors of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and recombinant human leukaemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) for culturing embryonic stem cells were used to capture the stem cells from the plated embryos. Mechanical and enzymetic methods were used to propagate the newly established human embryonic stem cells line. The new cell line was checked for pluripotent characteristics with detecting the expression of stemness genes and observing spontaneous differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Finally similar step-wise protocols from definitive endoderm to target specific cells were used to check the cell line's ability to directly differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells. RESULTS: We generated a new Chinese human embryonic stem cells line, CH1. This cell line showed the same characteristics as other reported Chinese human embryonic stem cells lines: normal morphology, karyotype and pluripotency in vitro and in vivo.

METHODS: Patients aged >/= 18 years and diagnosed with hematologic malignancies initiating HEC or MEC and antiemetic prophylaxis with palonosetron (Group 1) and other 5-HT(3) RAs (Group 2) for the first time in a hospital outpatient setting between 4/1/2007 and 3/31/2009 were identified from the Premier Perspective Database. Within each cycle, CINV events were identified (in the hospital outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room settings) through ICD-9 codes for nausea, vomiting, and/or volume depletion (from each CT administration day 1 until the end of the CT cycle), or use of rescue medications (day 2 until the end of the CT cycle). Negative binomial distribution generalized linear multivariate regression model estimating the CINV event rate on CT, specific CT cycles, and cancer diagnosis (leukemia/lymphoma)-matched groups in the follow-up period (first of 8 cycles or 6 months) was developed. RESULTS: Of 971 identified patients, 211 initiated palonosetron (Group 1). Group 1 patients comprised of more females [50.2 vs. 41.4%; p = 0.0226], Whites [74.4 vs. 70.4%, and Hispanics [7.6 vs. 6.3%; all races p = 0.0105], received more HEC treatments [89.6 vs. 84.2%; all CT types p = 0.0129], and had more lymphoma diagnosed patients [89.6 vs. 76.3%; all cancer types p = 0.0033] at baseline. After controlling for differences in several demographic and clinical variables, the regression model predicted a 20.4% decrease in CINV event rate per CT cycle for Group 1 versus Group 2 patients. Study limitations include potential lack of generalizability, absence of data on certain confounders including alcohol consumption and prior history of motion sickness, potential underestimation of incidence of uncontrolled CINV, and inability to draw conclusions pertaining to cause and effect relationship. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective hospital study, patients with hematologic malignancies treated with HEC or MEC and initiated on antiemetic prophylaxis with palonosetron in the hospital outpatient setting were more likely to experience significantly lower CINV event rates (in the hospital outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room settings) versus patients initiated on other 5-HT(3) RAs.","['Craver, Chris', 'Gayle, Julie', 'Balu, Sanjeev', 'Buchner, Deborah']","['Craver C', 'Gayle J', 'Balu S', 'Buchner D']","['Premier Inc., 2320 Cascade Pointe Blvd., Charlotte, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,2011/05/06 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/06 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3111/13696998.2011.582908 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2011;14(3):341-9. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2011.582908.

The antiproliferative activities of these compounds correlate well with their abilities to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistic studies indicate that they target the vinblastine binding site of tubulin and inhibit cellular tubulin polymerization. Hence, these compounds induce the formation of aberrant mitotic spindles and mitotic arrest, resulting in intensive apoptosis.

In LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, PMA induces tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) secretion and inhibits proliferation; bryostatin 1 does not, and indeed blocks the response to PMA. This difference has been attributed to bryostatin 1 not localizing PKCdelta to the plasma membrane. Since phorbol ester lipophilicity influences PKCdelta localization, we have examined in LNCaP cells a series of phorbol esters and related derivatives spanning some eight logs in lipophilicity (logP) to see if any behave like bryostatin 1. The compounds showed marked differences in their effects on proliferation and TNFalpha secretion. For example, maximal responses for TNFalpha secretion relative to PMA ranged from 97 % for octyl-indolactam V to 24 % for phorbol 12,13-dibenzoate. Dose-response curves ranged from monophasic for indolactam V to markedly biphasic for sapintoxin D. The divergent patterns of response, however, correlated neither to lipophilicity, to plasma membrane translocation of PKCdelta, nor to the ability to interact with model membranes. In U937 human leukemia cells, a second system in which PMA and bryostatin 1 have divergent effects, viz. PMA but not bryostatin 1 inhibits proliferation and induces attachment, all the compounds acted like PMA for proliferation, but several induced a reduced level or a biphasic dose-response curve for attachment. We conclude that active phorbol esters are not all equivalent. Depending on the system, some might partially resemble bryostatin 1 in their behavior; this encourages the concept that bryostatin-like behavior may be obtained from other structural templates.","['Kedei, Noemi', 'Lubart, Emanuel', 'Lewin, Nancy E', 'Telek, Andrea', 'Lim, Langston', 'Mannan, Poonam', 'Garfield, Susan H', 'Kraft, Matthew B', 'Keck, Gary E', 'Kolusheva, Sofiya', 'Jelinek, Raz', 'Blumberg, Peter M']","['Kedei N', 'Lubart E', 'Lewin NE', 'Telek A', 'Lim L', 'Mannan P', 'Garfield SH', 'Kraft MB', 'Keck GE', 'Kolusheva S', 'Jelinek R', 'Blumberg PM']","['Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,2011/05/05 06:00,2011/09/03 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbic.201100064 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2011 May 16;12(8):1242-51. doi: 10.1002/cbic.201100064.

The authors review here their experience with second malignant neoplasms (SMN) as well as the result of an extensive search of the recent literature. The primary malignancies discussed in this article include Hodgkin's disease, pediatric cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and other types of tumors. The international literature was searched (Medline 1989-1995) for reports of SMN with special emphasis on risk factors and the molecular mechanisms of tumor induction. In Hodgkin's disease, a 3 to 5-fold elevated risk for SMN was recognized, with a 15-year cumulative incidence in the range of 11-18%. All types of malignancies have a statistically increased risk (leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, solid tumors). The risk for leukemia is related to the intensity of treatment with alkylating agents. Some solid tumors like lung cancer or breast cancer are related to radiation therapy. Present-day treatments may carry a lower risk of inducing secondary malignancies than treatments in the past. For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as primary malignancy, fewer data exist on SMN. In pediatric cancer, no general risk estimate can be given and the genetic influence is greater as a cause of SMN. The improved prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia has led to a changing pattern of pediatric SMN. In head and neck- and in lung cancer, the same etiologic factors which cause the primary tumor may also cause SMN. SMN occur as part of familial cancer syndromes. Two types of treatment related leukemias (mostly AMLs) exist and can be recognized by cytogenetic and molecular analysis. A complete follow-up is necessary to fully appreciate the risk of second malignancy. The goal to prevent SMN must be reached without decreasing the cure rates of the primary tumor. New treatment approaches need to be carefully monitored for SMN. Improved tests of mutagenesis and molecular screening may help to recognize patients prone to develop SMN and permit to estimate certain types of risk. Screening and prevention strategies are useful in high-risk situations.","['Munker, R', 'Hiller, E', 'Melnyk, A', 'Gutjahr, P']","['Munker R', 'Hiller E', 'Melnyk A', 'Gutjahr P']","['UNIV TEXAS,MD ANDERSON CANC CTR,HOUSTON,TX.

As model we used a well established adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ADI) system. This involves transfer of in situ activated anti-tumor immune spleen lymphocytes (ISPL) from the tumor-resistant mouse strain B10.D2 (H-2(d), M1s(b)) into 5 Gy sublethally irradiated syngeneic ESb-MP lymphoma-bearing DBA/2 (H-2(d), M1s(a)) mice. Experiments were performed by transfer of ISPL from B10.D2 into DBA/2 tumor-bearing mice (GvL effect on liver metabolism) and into DBA/2 non-tumor-bearing mice (GvH effect on liver metabolism). Our results show that glycogen in hepatocytes decreased dramatically 5 days after ISPL transfer, which coincided with a high increase of large fat granules. 8 days after ISPL transfer, livers started to re-express glycogen and to decrease their lipid content. Normalization of both parameters was seen after day 30. These changes were qualitatively similar in both GvL and GvH. Measurement of activity of the liver marker enzymes, GOT and GPT, in the sera of animals subjected to GvL or GvH, showed peak values also at day 5, coinciding with the loss of glycogen. Quantitative differences were seen, however, in that much higher levels were reached in GvL than in GvH. Immune system recovery from irradiation damage and liver regeneration after immune cell mediated liver damage are likely explanations for the reversibility of the metabolic changes and for the lack of GVH disease and mortality in this new and effective cellular cancer immunotherapy model.","['Lee, K', 'Hacker, H', 'Umansky, V', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Rocha, M']","['Lee K', 'Hacker H', 'Umansky V', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Rocha M']","['DEUTSCH KREBSFORSCHUNGSZENTRUM,ZELLULARE IMMUNOL ABT,FSP TUMORIMMUNOL,D-69120 HEIDELBERG,GERMANY.

They inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, although their cytotoxic mechanism remains unclear. RNase A has no tumoricidal activity. It is hypothesized that leczymes bind to cell surface sialoglycoconjugate receptors, enter the cell, and subsequently degrade RNA. In order to investigate the cytotoxic mechanism of cSBL, a leczyme from Rana catesbeiana eggs, we established cSBL-resistant clone RC-150 from mouse leukemia P388 cells. cSBL-treated P388 cells showed extensive RNA degradation over the course of 1 h, whereas cSBL-treated RC-150 cells showed no RNA degradation even over the course of 24 h. Treatment of P388 cells with cSBL led to decreased concentration of intracellular Ca2+, decreased protein kinase A activity, and increased protein kinase G activity. Incubation with cSBL decreased glutathione levels and enhanced glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in P388 cells, but had no effect on RC-150 cells. We conclude that cSBL-specific degradation of RNA occurs in cSBL-sensitive tumor cells, that cSBL leads to alteration of signal transduction and an intracellular protein kinase cascade reaction, and that internalized cSBL is detoxified by GST or thioltransferase. Our findings support a bifunctional model in which a leczyme is both an adhesive protein (binding to sialoglycoconjugates) and an enzyme (displaying RNnase activity).","['Nitta, K', 'Ozaki, K', 'Tsukamoto, Y', 'Hosono, M', 'Ogawakonno, Y', 'Kawauchi, H', 'Takayanagi, Y', 'Tsuiki, S', 'Hakomori, S']","['Nitta K', 'Ozaki K', 'Tsukamoto Y', 'Hosono M', 'Ogawakonno Y', 'Kawauchi H', 'Takayanagi Y', 'Tsuiki S', 'Hakomori S']","['UNIV WASHINGTON, SEATTLE, WA 98119 USA.

Patients with unmutated IGHV have a more aggressive disease and a worse outcome than patients with cells having somatic IGHV gene mutations. Moreover, up to 30% of the unmutated CLL clones exhibit very similar or identical B cell receptors (BcR), often encoded by the same IG genes. These ""stereotyped"" BcRs have been classified into defined subsets. The presence of an IGHV gene somatic mutation and the utilization of a skewed gene repertoire compared with normal B cells together with the expression of stereotyped receptors by unmutated CLL clones may indicate stimulation/selection by antigenic epitopes. This antigenic stimulation may occur prior to or during neoplastic transformation, but it is unknown whether this stimulation/selection continues after leukemogenesis has ceased. In this study, we focused on seven CLL cases with stereotyped BcR Subset #8 found among a cohort of 700 patients; in six, the cells expressed IgG and utilized IGHV4-39 and IGKV1-39/IGKV1D-39 genes, as reported for Subset #8 BcR. One case exhibited special features, including expression of IgM or IgG by different subclones consequent to an isotype switch, allelic inclusion at the IGH locus in the IgM-expressing cells and a particular pattern of cytogenetic lesions. Collectively, the data indicate a process of antigenic stimulation/selection of the fully transformed CLL cells leading to the expansion of the Subset #8 IgG-bearing subclone.","['Colombo, Monica', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Reverberi, Daniele', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Fabbi, Marina', 'Quintana, Giovanni', 'Quarta, Giovanni', 'Ghiotto, Fabio', 'Fais, Franco', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Colombo M', 'Cutrona G', 'Reverberi D', 'Fabris S', 'Neri A', 'Fabbi M', 'Quintana G', 'Quarta G', 'Ghiotto F', 'Fais F', 'Ferrarini M']","['Division of Medical Oncology C, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, IST, Genova, Italy. monica.colombo@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,2011/05/05 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00047 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00047 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2011;17(7-8):834-9. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00047.

Danusertib (formerly PHA-739358) is a potent pan-aurora and ABL kinase inhibitor with activity against known BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I. Here, the individual contribution of both signaling pathways to the therapeutic effect of Danusertib as well as mechanisms underlying the development of resistance and, as a consequence, strategies to overcome resistance to Danusertib were investigated. Starting at low concentrations, a dose-dependent inhibition of BCR-ABL activity was observed, whereas inhibition of aurora kinase activity required higher concentrations, pointing to a therapeutic window between the two effects. Interestingly, the emergence of resistant clones during Danusertib exposure in vitro occurred considerably less frequently than with comparable concentrations of IM. In addition, Danusertib-resistant clones had no mutations in BCR-ABL or aurora kinase domains and remained IM-sensitive. Overexpression of Abcg2 efflux transporter was identified and functionally validated as the predominant mechanism of acquired Danusertib resistance in vitro. Finally, the combined treatment with IM and Danusertib significantly reduced the emergence of drug resistance in vitro, raising hope that this drug combination may also achieve more durable disease control in vivo.","['Balabanov, Stefan', 'Gontarewicz, Artur', 'Keller, Gunhild', 'Raddrizzani, Laura', 'Braig, Melanie', 'Bosotti, Roberta', 'Moll, Jurgen', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Barett, Christine', 'Rohe, Imke', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Balabanov S', 'Gontarewicz A', 'Keller G', 'Raddrizzani L', 'Braig M', 'Bosotti R', 'Moll J', 'Jost E', 'Barett C', 'Rohe I', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Holyoake TL', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Klinik fur Onkologie, Hamatologie und Knochenmarktransplantation mit Sektion Pneumologie, Universitares Cancer Center Hamburg, Universitats-Klinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/05/05 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0019164 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Apr 26;6(4):e19164. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019164.,10.1371/journal.pone.0019164 [doi],20110426,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'M3X659D0FY (danusertib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,PMC3082549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the epidemiology of PIV infections in children with cancer has not been well studied. METHODS: This retrospective study sought to determine the epidemiology of PIV infections and risk factors for progression to an LRTI in 1381 children diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma, between 2000 and 2009. RESULTS: PIV infections were diagnosed in 83 (10%) of 820 children tested for respiratory infections. PIV type 3 accounted for 49 (61%) of the PIV infections. Of the 83 infections, 75 (90%) were community acquired. Children less than 2 years of age were more likely to have PIV infection (P = 0.002; odds ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-4.8). PIV infections were more common in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia as compared with other malignancies (P < 0.0001; odds ratio, 4.13; 95% confidence interval, 2.37-7.21). The majority of patients, 66 (80%), had URTI. Children with LRTI were a median age of 27 months as compared with 56 months for children with URTI (P = 0.005). Fever with severe neutropenia was more common in patients with LRTI than with URTI (P = 0.02). LRTI was significantly associated with absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/muL (P = 0.002) and absolute lymphocyte count <100 cells/muL (P = 0.008) at onset of PIV infection. There was no mortality attributed to PIV infections, although 3 children required mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to PIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: PIV was the second most common respiratory viral infection in this population after influenza (A and B). Young children were more likely to have PIV infection and LRTI. Severe neutropenia and lymphopenia were associated with LRTI.","['Srinivasan, Ashok', 'Wang, Chong', 'Yang, Jie', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Shenep, Jerry L', 'Leung, Wing H', 'Hayden, Randall T']","['Srinivasan A', 'Wang C', 'Yang J', 'Inaba H', 'Shenep JL', 'Leung WH', 'Hayden RT']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. ashok.srinivasan@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,2011/05/05 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e31821d190f [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2011 Oct;30(10):855-9. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e31821d190f.,10.1097/INF.0b013e31821d190f [doi],,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Paramyxoviridae Infections/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/epidemiology/virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']","['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-28S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3196524,,,,['NIHMS321795'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen CML patients received conditioning therapy followed by CD34(+)-selected peripheral blood stem cells from matched siblings (n = 7) or unrelated (n = 7) donors. Donor-derived mature dendritic cells generated in vitro from CD14(+) monocytes were loaded with human leukocyte Ag-restricted peptides derived from PR1, WT1, and/or B-cell receptor-ABL and used to repetitively stimulate donor CD8(+) T cells in the presence of IL-2 and IL-7.

Recently, we identified INCA1 as an interaction partner and a substrate of cyclin A1 in complex with CDK2. On a functional level, we identified a novel cyclin-binding site in the INCA1 protein. INCA1 inhibited CDK2 activity and cell proliferation. The inhibitory effects depended on the cyclin-interacting domain. Mitogenic and oncogenic signals suppressed INCA1 expression, whereas it was induced by cell cycle arrest. We established a deletional mouse model that showed increased CDK2 activity in spleen with altered spleen architecture in Inca1(-/-) mice. Inca1(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts showed an increase in the fraction of S-phase cells. Furthermore, blasts from acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia patients expressed significantly reduced INCA1 levels highlighting its relevance for growth control in vivo. Taken together, this study identifies a novel CDK inhibitor with reduced expression in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia. The molecular events that control the cell cycle occur in a sequential process to ensure a tight regulation, which is important for the survival of a cell and includes the detection and repair of genetic damage and the prevention of uncontrolled cell division.","['Baumer, Nicole', 'Tickenbrock, Lara', 'Tschanter, Petra', 'Lohmeyer, Lisa', 'Diederichs, Sven', 'Baumer, Sebastian', 'Skryabin, Boris V', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Agrawal-Singh, Shuchi', 'Kohler, Gabriele', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Baumer N', 'Tickenbrock L', 'Tschanter P', 'Lohmeyer L', 'Diederichs S', 'Baumer S', 'Skryabin BV', 'Zhang F', 'Agrawal-Singh S', 'Kohler G', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Koschmieder S', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University ofMvnster, 48129 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2011/05/05 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)57538-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.203471 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Aug 12;286(32):28210-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.203471.

It is widely used in food, cosmetics, and household products. Many of its monoterpene counterparts have been applied in antiproliferative assays, leading to promising results in the prevention or even treatment of cancers. However, despite its theoretic potential, no paper reports the evaluation of antiproliferative capacity of this alcohol. Thus, antioxidant potential of three monoterpenoids (carvone, perillyl alcohol, and alpha-terpineol) was measured using two methods: DPPH and ORAC. Also, the antiproliferative effect of these monoterpenoids against nine cancerous cell lines were performed and compared to limonene and doxorubicin. Results showed that all samples tested had very low antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay, but alpha-terpineol (2.72mumolTrolox equiv./mumol) could be compared to commercial antioxidants in the ORAC assay. The antiproliferative results obtained encourage future in vivo studies for alpha-terpineol, since this monoterpenoid presented cytostatic effect against six cell lines, especially for breast adenocarcinoma and chronic myeloid leukemia, in a range of 181-588muM.","['Bicas, J L', 'Neri-Numa, I A', 'Ruiz, A L T G', 'De Carvalho, J E', 'Pastore, G M']","['Bicas JL', 'Neri-Numa IA', 'Ruiz AL', 'De Carvalho JE', 'Pastore GM']","['Department of Food Science, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil. jlbicas@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,2011/05/05 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(11)00148-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2011.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2011 Jul;49(7):1610-5. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2011.04.012.

Through clever bioinformatic weighting analysis, the authors describe a method to convert this signature into a single score for any given sample and then test the prognostic utility of this 'LSC score' in publicly available gene expression profiles from bulk AML samples. They demonstrate that a high LSC score is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients and further demonstrate that the score is independent of known prognostic factors, including age, karyotype and mutation of the FLT3 or NPM1 genes. These findings are important and directly relate transcriptional dysregulation in AML LSCs with the outcome in patient samples, thus reinforcing the belief that these cellular populations are crucial for the initial propagation and subsequent relapse and resistance of leukemia.","['Gudgin, Emma J', 'Huntly, Brian J P']","['Gudgin EJ', 'Huntly BJ']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK. bjph2@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Editorial'],England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,2011/05/05 06:00,2011/05/05 06:01,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/05 06:01 [medline]']","['scrt62 [pii]', '10.1186/scrt62 [doi]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2011 Apr 27;2(2):21. doi: 10.1186/scrt62.,10.1186/scrt62 [doi],20110427,"['0 (FIZ1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",['G116/187/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC3226292,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20111110'],,,,

However, in many cases, prolonged administration of kinase inhibitors often leads to acquired resistance, and the therapeutic effect is subsequently diminished. The wealth of recent studies using biochemical, kinetic, and structural approaches have revealed the molecular basis for the clinically observed resistance. In this review, we highlight several of the most common molecular mechanisms that lead to acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors observed with the cAbl (cellular form of the Abelson leukemia virus tyrosine kinase) and the type III receptor tyrosine kinase cKit, including a newly identified mechanism resulting from accelerated kinase activation caused by mutations in the activation loop. Strategies to overcome the loss of drug sensitivity that represents a challenge currently facing the field and the emerging approaches to circumvent resistance are discussed.","['DiNitto, Jonathan P', 'Wu, Joe C']","['DiNitto JP', 'Wu JC']","['Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol,Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,8903774,2011/05/05 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10409238.2011.578612 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol. 2011 Aug;46(4):295-309. doi: 10.3109/10409238.2011.578612.

METHODS: L1210 cells were examined after 6 hours of incubation following SDT induction with ultrasound at a frequency of 1.1 MHz and an intensity of 3 W/cm(2) in the presence of 1 mug/mL protoporphyrin IX. Apoptosis rate and cell survival rate were assessed through double fluorescent staining with Annexin V-PE and 7-amino-actinomycin D as determined by flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscope and fluorescence microscope were used to identify the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (autophagic vacuoles) during autophagy. Western blots were used to examine the processing of light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II and Atg5 expression levels. RESULTS: This study showed that SDT treatment reduced the numbers of viable cells to 30.17% and enhanced the apoptotic cells to 19.37% (p < 0.05 compare with control). Additionally, autophagic vacuoles formation clearly occurred after SDT and simultaneously accompanied by obvious LC3 processing and increased Atg5 expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: In L1210 cells, both apoptosis and autophagy were involved in cell damage induced by SDT treatment at the experimental conditions.","['Zhao, Ping', 'Liu, Quanhong', 'Wang, Pan', 'Li, Tao', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Su, Sheng', 'Zhang, Mengying']","['Zhao P', 'Liu Q', 'Wang P', 'Li T', 'Wang X', 'Su S', 'Zhang M']","['Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Shaanxi, China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,2011/05/05 06:00,2011/09/15 06:00,['2011/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cbr.2010.0807 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2011 Apr;26(2):209-18. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2010.0807.,10.1089/cbr.2010.0807 [doi],,"['0 (Atg5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2)', '0 (Map1lc3b protein, mouse)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Ultrasonic Therapy/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we showed a critical role for the chloride channel-3 (ClC-3) in cisplatin resistance in human erythroleukemia K562 and RK562 cells. We found that a chloride channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) could protect cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis. NPPB treatment decreased the mRNA and the protein expression of Bax/Bcl-2, decreased the protein expressions of cytochrome C and caspase-3, and increased the mRNA expressions of cyclin D1 and ClC-3 in cells treated with cisplatin. The caspase-3 activity was decreased significantly and the rate of cell apoptosis was decreased. NPPB treatment increased CIC-3 expression, which could increase acidification of intracellular compartments, and increased sequestration of cisplatin, inducing decreased effective drug concentrations, and subsequently cell death. Collectively, our data indicate that NPPB can induce drug resistance to cisplatin by upregulating the expression of CIC-3. NPPB-induced CIC-3 expression facilitates acidification of sequestrated cisplatin, and plays an important role in preventing cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human erythroleukemia K562 and RK562 cells.","['Xu, Ye', 'Zheng, Hua', 'Kang, Jin-Song', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Su, Jing', 'Li, Hong-Yan', 'Sun, Lian-Kun']","['Xu Y', 'Zheng H', 'Kang JS', 'Zhang L', 'Su J', 'Li HY', 'Sun LK']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Norman Bethune College of Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anat Rec (Hoboken),"Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)",101292775,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ar.21392 [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Rec (Hoboken). 2011 Jun;294(6):945-52. doi: 10.1002/ar.21392.

So far, nilotinib is considered a well-tolerated drug with little if any side effects, although an increase in the fasting glucose level has been reported. We examined a series of 24 consecutive CML patients treated with nilotinib in our center for the development of non-hematologic adverse events. Three of these 24 CML patients developed a rapidly progressive peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) during treatment with nilotinib. In all three cases, PAOD required repeated angioplasty and/or multiple surgeries within a few months. No PAOD was known before nilotinib-therapy in these patients, although all three had received imatinib. In two patients, pre-existing risk factors predisposing for PAOD were known, and one of them had developed diabetes mellitus during nilotinib. In the other 21 patients treated with nilotinib in our center, one less severe PAOD, one myocardial infarction, one spinal infarction, one subdural hematoma, and one sudden death of unknown etiology were recorded. In summary, treatment with nilotinib may be associated with an increased risk of vascular adverse events, including PAOD development. In a subgroup of patients, these events are severe or even life-threatening. Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown, we recommend screening for pre-existing PAOD and for vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus in all patients before starting nilotinib and in the follow up during nilotinib-therapy.","['Aichberger, Karl J', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Schernthaner, Gerit-Holger', 'Schillinger, Martin', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Valent, Peter']","['Aichberger KJ', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Schillinger M', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner G', 'Sillaber C', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/23 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22037 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2011 Jul;86(7):533-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22037.

We looked at factors (including adherence to therapy) affecting the outcome in a large cohort of patients with CP-CML. All the 516 patients received Imatinib free-of-cost through a company sponsored scheme, which mandated regular three monthly visits for drug procurement. Data regarding the disease characteristics, adherence to treatment and outcomes, were obtained from patients records. Unwarranted interruption of treatment for more than 1 week was defined as nonadherence. With a median follow-up of 39 months, the estimated 5-year event free survival (EFS) was 70.8% (95%, CI = 63.3-78.3). Nearly one-third of the patients (29.6%) were found to be nonadherent at some point during their treatment. On univariate analysis, the factors adversely affecting the EFS were prolonged symptom duration before diagnosis, treatment with hydroxyurea for more than 1 month before start of Imatinib, and nonadherence to therapy. Only nonadherence was significant in multivariate analysis (HR1.6; P = 0.048). The 5-year EFS in adherent and nonadherent patients was 76.7% and 59.8% respectively (P = 0.011, log rank test). Nonadherent patients were less likely to achieve complete cytogenetic responses (26% versus 44%; P = 0.004; chi(2) test) at any point. A significant proportion of patients with CP-CML have drug interruptions due to nonadherence during therapy and this compromises the EFS.

It has been reported that Alternol can inhibit proliferation of mouse leukemia cells and human gastric carcinoma cells, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Alternol on prostate cancer cells in comparison to prostate cells. METHODS: The MTT assay was utilized to assess cell viability. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. Protein expression levels were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Alternol treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of prostate cancer cells but had lesser effects on prostate cells. Alternol inhibited AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in prostate cancer C4-2 cells but stimulated AMPK phosphorylation in prostate RWPE-1 cells. Inhibition of p27 phosphorylation was observed in C4-2 cells whereas a promotion of p27 phosphorylation was seen in RWPE-1 cells. Alternol treatment resulted in a profound increase in the LC3II/LC3I protein ratio in RWPE-1 cells but not in C4-2 cells. A dose-dependent down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein was detected in C4-2 cells but not in RWPE-1 cells. Pretreatment of cells with Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) before Alternol treatment abolished the selective antitumor effect of Alternol. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal for the first time that Alternol exerts a selective antitumor effect on prostate cancer cells when compared with RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells. In addition, the AMPK signaling pathway is responsible for the selective antitumor effects of Alternol.","['Yeung, Eddie D', 'Morrison, Alex', 'Plumeri, Daniel', 'Wang, Jingying', 'Tong, Chao', 'Yan, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Ji']","['Yeung ED', 'Morrison A', 'Plumeri D', 'Wang J', 'Tong C', 'Yan X', 'Li J']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,2011/05/04 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pros.21417 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2012 Feb 1;72(2):165-72. doi: 10.1002/pros.21417.

The plant-derived agent silvestrol specifically inhibits translation initiation by interfering with eIF4A/mRNA assembly with eIF4F. Silvestrol has potent in vitro and in vivo activity in multiple cancer models including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is under pre-clinical development by the US National Cancer Institute, but no information is available about potential mechanisms of resistance. In a separate report, we showed that intraperitoneal silvestrol is approximately 100% bioavailable systemically, although oral doses were only 1% bioavailable despite an apparent lack of metabolism. To explore mechanisms of silvestrol resistance and the possible role of efflux transporters in silvestrol disposition, we characterized multi-drug resistance transporter expression and function in a silvestrol-resistant ALL cell line generated via culture of the 697 ALL cell line in gradually increasing silvestrol concentrations. This resistant cell line, 697-R, shows significant upregulation of ABCB1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) as well as cross-resistance to known Pgp substrates vincristine and romidepsin. Furthermore, 697-R cells readily efflux the fluorescent Pgp substrate rhodamine 123. This effect is prevented by Pgp inhibitors verapamil and cyclosporin A, as well as siRNA to ABCB1, with concomitant re-sensitization to silvestrol. Together, these data indicate that silvestrol is a substrate of Pgp, a potential obstacle that must be considered in the development of silvestrol for oral delivery or targeting to tumors protected by Pgp overexpression.","['Gupta, Sneha V', 'Sass, Ellen J', 'Davis, Melanie E', 'Edwards, Ryan B', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Byrd, John C', 'Pan, Li', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Kinghorn, A Douglas', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Lucas, David M']","['Gupta SV', 'Sass EJ', 'Davis ME', 'Edwards RB', 'Lozanski G', 'Heerema NA', 'Lehman A', 'Zhang X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Byrd JC', 'Pan L', 'Chan KK', 'Kinghorn AD', 'Phelps MA', 'Grever MR', 'Lucas DM']","['College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AAPS J,The AAPS journal,101223209,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1208/s12248-011-9276-7 [doi]'],ppublish,AAPS J. 2011 Sep;13(3):357-64. doi: 10.1208/s12248-011-9276-7.

Recently, an increasing interest has been reported in introducing to clinical practice screening for mutations in the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) gene in AML, as it seems to be a good prognostic factor. However, there is no reliable established method for assessing CEBPA mutations during the diagnostic work-up of AMLs. We describe here a straightforward and reliable fragment analysis method based in PCR capillary electrophoresis (PCR-CE) for screening of CEBPA mutations; moreover, we present the results obtained in 151 intermediate-risk karyotype AML patients (aged 16-80 years). The method gave a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 93% with a lower detection limit of 1-5% for CEBPA mutations. The series found 19 mutations and four polymorphisms in 12 patients, seven of whom (58%) presented two mutations. The overall frequency of CEBPA mutations in AML was 8% (n = 12). CEBPA mutations showed no coincidence with FLT3-ITD or NPM1 mutations. CEBPA mutation predicted better disease-free survival in the group of patients without FLT3-ITD, NPM, or both genes mutated (HR 3.6, IC 95%; 1.0-13.2, p = 0.05) and better overall survival in patients younger than 65 of this group without molecular markers (HR 4.0, IC 95%; 1.0-17.4, p = 0.05). In conclusion, the fragment analysis method based in PCR-CE is a rapid, specific, and sensitive method for CEBPA mutation screening and our results confirm that CEBPA mutations can identify a subgroup of patients with favorable prognosis in AML with intermediate-risk karyotype.","['Fuster, Oscar', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Bolufer, Pascual', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Valencia, Ana', 'Ibanez, Mariam', 'Dolz, Sandra', 'de Juan, Inmaculada', 'Jimenez, Antonio', 'Gomez, Maria Teresa', 'Buno, Ismael', 'Martinez, Joaquin', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Moscardo, Federico', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel']","['Fuster O', 'Barragan E', 'Bolufer P', 'Such E', 'Valencia A', 'Ibanez M', 'Dolz S', 'de Juan I', 'Jimenez A', 'Gomez MT', 'Buno I', 'Martinez J', 'Cervera J', 'Montesinos P', 'Moscardo F', 'Sanz MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Department of Medical Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Escuela de enfermeria 7 feminine planta., Avd.

Here, we knocked down the NPM1 expression by RNA interference to investigate the role of NPM1 in leukemic cells proliferation and apoptosis. The interference vector pNPM1-shRNA was constructed and transfected into the human leukemic K562 cell line. The expression levels of NPM1 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cells proliferation potential in vitro was assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was used to detect the distribution of cell cycle. Cellular apoptosis was reflected by the relative activities of caspase-3 and caspase-8. The results showed that the expression levels of NPM1 mRNA and protein in K562 cells were significantly reduced after pNPM1-shRNA transfection. The cells growth was significantly inhibited in a time-dependent manner and the number of colonies was significantly reduced in the pNPM1-shRNA transfected cells. Meanwhile, the percentage of cells in G1 phase in the K562/pNPM1-shRNA cells was significantly increased. In addition, there were higher relative activities of caspase-3/8 in the pNPM1-shRNA transfected cells.

To clarify whether FLT3-ITD load as expressed as FLT3-ITD/wt ratio is also relevant in patients with NPM1 mutated AML, we assessed the FLT3-ITD mutation status and FLT3-ITD/wt ratio by fragment analysis in 638 NPM1mut AML (339 females; 299 males; 17.8-88.0 years), and analyzed its prognostic relevance in 355 patients. FLT3-ITD of various length and load were detected in 243/638 cases (38.1%). Median EFS (19.3 vs 9.7 months, P<0.001) and median 2-year survival rate (72.0 vs 52.7%, P=0.006) was better in FLT3wt (n=212 with available follow-up data) than FLT3-ITD (n=143). A higher FLT3-ITD/wt ratio as continuous variable was correlated with a shorter EFS (P=0.028). When patients were separated into subgroups according to the FLT3-ITD mutation load, only a FLT3-ITD/wt ratio >/=0.5 conferred an independent adverse impact on EFS and OS, and retained its prognostic significance also in multivariate analysis (P=0.009 for EFS, P=0.008 for OS). In conclusion, for risk estimation in NPM1 mutated AML not only the FLT3-ITD status, but also the FLT3-ITD load has to be taken into account. These data might contribute to clinical decision making in AML.","['Schnittger, S', 'Bacher, U', 'Kern, W', 'Alpermann, T', 'Haferlach, C', 'Haferlach, T']","['Schnittger S', 'Bacher U', 'Kern W', 'Alpermann T', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. susanne.schnittger@mll.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201197 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.97 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1297-304. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.97.

In some studies anaemia has been found in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) during maintenance therapy and rarely in lymphoma. We studied frequency of B19 infection and its implications in new onset acute leukaemia (mostly ALL) and lymphoma in children. METHODS: Seventy serum samples from 35 children (age <12 yr, 29 males) newly diagnosed with haematological malignancies (on induction therapy) were collected together with 34 controls (solid tumours). Children were examined clinically and for anti-B19 IgM antibodies by quantitative ELISA and B19 DNA by PCR (VP1-VP2) and nested-PCR (VP1 unique). Bone marrow aspirates were examined histopathologically, whenever possible. RESULTS: Of the 35 children, 22 had acute leukaemia while 13 had lymphoma. B19 infection was seen in six (17.1%) of 35 children (5 ALL, 1 NHL), two at diagnosis and four during follow up compared to none in the control. Among five B19 IgM positive ALL (n=18) children, two had B19 genome and two had giant pronormoblasts (lantern cells; but one lacked B19 DNA). Of the 70 serum samples tested, eight (11.4%) had anti-B19 IgM as two children had persistent B19 infection and one showed atypical maculopapular rashes (lower limbs) while 12 (34.3%) had anti-B19 IgG antibodies. B19 infected children had unexplained anaemia (80%), required more blood transfusions (6.6 +/- 4.8 Units vs 3.0 +/- 2.6 Units) besides induction chemotherapy was delayed (60%) and required longer duration of therapy (29.2 +/- 20 vs 6.3 +/- 7.8 days) (P<0.02). Five children (2 ALL, 2 AML, 1 NHL) died but none were infected with B19. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: B19 infection should be considered in children with ALL as it frequently caused unexplained anaemia and delay in induction chemotherapy.","['Kishore, Janak', 'Sen, Manodeep', 'Kumar, Ashutosh', 'Kumar, Archana']","['Kishore J', 'Sen M', 'Kumar A', 'Kumar A']","['Department of Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India. janaksgpgi@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['IndianJMedRes_2011_133_4_407_80132 [pii]'],ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2011 Apr;133:407-13.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (anti-IgG)', '0 (anti-IgM)']",IM,"['Anemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*immunology/*virology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy']",,PMC3103174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, how TIF1gamma regulates the development of different blood cell lineages and whether TIF1gamma is involved in human hematological malignancies remain to be determined. Here we have shown that TIF1gamma was a tumor suppressor in mouse and human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Loss of Tif1g in mouse HSCs favored the expansion of the granulo-monocytic progenitor compartment. Furthermore, Tif1g deletion induced the age-dependent appearance of a cell-autonomous myeloproliferative disorder in mice that recapitulated essential characteristics of human CMML. TIF1gamma was almost undetectable in leukemic cells of 35% of CMML patients. This downregulation was related to the hypermethylation of CpG sequences and specific histone modifications in the gene promoter. A demethylating agent restored the normal epigenetic status of the TIF1G promoter in human cells, which correlated with a reestablishment of TIF1gamma expression. Together, these results demonstrate that TIF1G is an epigenetically regulated tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic cells and suggest that changes in TIF1gamma expression may be a biomarker of response to demethylating agents in CMML.","['Aucagne, Romain', 'Droin, Nathalie', 'Paggetti, Jerome', 'Lagrange, Brice', 'Largeot, Anne', 'Hammann, Arlette', 'Bataille, Amandine', 'Martin, Laurent', 'Yan, Kai-Ping', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Losson, Regine', 'Solary, Eric', 'Bastie, Jean-Noel', 'Delva, Laurent']","['Aucagne R', 'Droin N', 'Paggetti J', 'Lagrange B', 'Largeot A', 'Hammann A', 'Bataille A', 'Martin L', 'Yan KP', 'Fenaux P', 'Losson R', 'Solary E', 'Bastie JN', 'Delva L']","['Inserm UMR 866, University of Burgundy, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['45213 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI45213 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2011 Jun;121(6):2361-70. doi: 10.1172/JCI45213.

Using population-based data from Sweden, we assessed the role of MPN treatment and subsequent AML/MDS risk with special focus on the leukemogenic potential of hydroxyurea (HU). METHODS: On the basis of a nationwide MPN cohort (N = 11,039), we conducted a nested case-control study, including 162 patients (153 and nine with subsequent AML and MDS diagnosis, respectively) and 242 matched controls. We obtained clinical and MPN treatment data for all patients. Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) as measures of AML/MDS risk. RESULTS: Forty-one (25%) of 162 patients with MPNs with AML/MDS development were never exposed to alkylating agents, radioactive phosphorous (P(32)), or HU. Compared with patients with who were not exposed to HU, the ORs for 1 to 499 g, 500 to 999 g, more than 1,000 g of HU were 1.5 (95% CI, 0.6 to 2.4), 1.4 (95% CI, 0.6 to 3.4), and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.3), respectively, for AML/MDS development (not significant). Patients with MPNs who received P(32) greater than 1,000 MBq and alkylators greater than 1 g had a 4.6-fold (95% CI, 2.1 to 9.8; P = .002) and 3.4-fold (95% CI, 1.1 to 10.6; P = .015) increased risk of AML/MDS, respectively. Patients receiving two or more cytoreductive treatments had a 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4 to 5.9) increased risk of transformation. CONCLUSION: The risk of AML/MDS development after MPN diagnosis was significantly associated with high exposures of P(32) and alkylators but not with HU treatment. Twenty-five percent of patients with MPNs who developed AML/MDS were not exposed to cytotoxic therapy, supporting a major role for nontreatment-related factors.","['Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Derolf, Asa R', 'Hultcrantz, Malin', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Ekstrand, Charlotta', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'Andreasson, Bjorn', 'Birgegard, Gunnar', 'Linder, Olle', 'Malm, Claes', 'Markevarn, Berit', 'Nilsson, Lars', 'Samuelsson, Jan', 'Granath, Fredrik', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Bjorkholm M', 'Derolf AR', 'Hultcrantz M', 'Kristinsson SY', 'Ekstrand C', 'Goldin LR', 'Andreasson B', 'Birgegard G', 'Linder O', 'Malm C', 'Markevarn B', 'Nilsson L', 'Samuelsson J', 'Granath F', 'Landgren O']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden. magnus.bjorkholm@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.7542 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7542 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 10;29(17):2410-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7542.

The predictive power of the score was developed and tested on a group of patients selected from a registry of 2060 patients enrolled in studies of first-line treatment with imatinib-based regimes. The EUTOS score using the percentage of basophils and spleen size best discriminated between high-risk and low-risk groups of patients, with a positive predictive value of not reaching a CCgR of 34%. Five-year progression-free survival was significantly better in the low- than in the high-risk group (90% vs 82%, P = .006). These results were confirmed in the validation sample. The score can be used to identify CML patients with significantly lower probabilities of responding to therapy and survival, thus alerting physicians to those patients who require closer observation and early intervention.","['Hasford, Joerg', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Hoffmann, Verena', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert', 'Lindoerfer, Doris', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Pfirrmann, Markus', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger']","['Hasford J', 'Baccarani M', 'Hoffmann V', 'Guilhot J', 'Saussele S', 'Rosti G', 'Guilhot F', 'Porkka K', 'Ossenkoppele G', 'Lindoerfer D', 'Simonsson B', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Hehlmann R']","['Institut fur Medizinische Informationsverarbeitung, Biometrie und Epidemiologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munchen, Germany. has@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/10/08 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44750-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-319038 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 21;118(3):686-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-319038.

ERG expression is down-regulated during early T-lymphopoiesis but maintained in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where it is recognized as an independent risk factor for adverse outcome. However, it is unclear whether ERG is directly involved in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and how its expression is regulated. Here we demonstrate that transgenic expression of ERG causes T-ALL in mice and that its knockdown reduces the proliferation of human MOLT4 T-ALL cells. We further demonstrate that ERG expression in primary human T-ALL cells is mediated by the binding of other T-cell oncogenes SCL/TAL1, LMO2, and LYL1 in concert with ERG, FLI1, and GATA3 to the ERG +85 enhancer. This enhancer is not active in normal T cells but in transgenic mice targets expression to fetal liver c-kit(+) cells, adult bone marrow stem/progenitors and early CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative thymic progenitors. Taken together, these data illustrate that ERG promotes T-ALL and that failure to extinguish activity of stem cell enhancers associated with regulatory transcription factors such as ERG can contribute to the development of leukemia.","['Thoms, Julie A I', 'Birger, Yehudit', 'Foster, Sam', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Kirschenbaum, Yael', 'Chandrakanthan, Vashe', 'Jonquieres, Georg', 'Spensberger, Dominik', 'Wong, Jason W', 'Oram, S Helen', 'Kinston, Sarah J', 'Groner, Yoram', 'Lock, Richard', 'MacKenzie, Karen L', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Pimanda, John E']","['Thoms JA', 'Birger Y', 'Foster S', 'Knezevic K', 'Kirschenbaum Y', 'Chandrakanthan V', 'Jonquieres G', 'Spensberger D', 'Wong JW', 'Oram SH', 'Kinston SJ', 'Groner Y', 'Lock R', 'MacKenzie KL', 'Gottgens B', 'Izraeli S', 'Pimanda JE']","['Lowy Cancer Research Centre and the Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44848-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-317990 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 30;117(26):7079-89. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-317990.

To investigate the effect of CD300F stimulation on TLR signaling, the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was treated with CD300F-specific mAbs or two synthetic peptides that represented the ITIM-like domains of CD300F. Treatment with these agents blocked TLR2-, 3-, 4-, and 9-mediated expression of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. The luciferase reporter assay in 293T cells and Western blot analysis of THP-1 cells revealed that these inhibitory actions were effective in pathways involving MyD88 and/or TRIF of TLR signaling and associated with marked suppression of IkappaB kinase activation, phosphorylation/degradation of IkappaB, and subsequent activation of NF-kappaB. Use of specific inhibitors and immunoprecipitation analysis further indicated that the inhibitory effects were mediated by Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase with inhibitory activity in hematopoietic cells. These data indicate that CD300F is an active regulator of TLR-mediated macrophage activation through its association with Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 and that the synthetic peptides can be applied for the regulation of immune responses that are induced by TLRs.","['Lee, Sang-Min', 'Kim, Eun-Ju', 'Suk, Kyoungho', 'Lee, Won-Ha']","['Lee SM', 'Kim EJ', 'Suk K', 'Lee WH']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1002184 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1002184 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Jun 1;186(11):6296-303. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1002184.

Successful transfection of THP-1 monocytes with subsequent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages is not a trivial matter, because according to previous transfection protocols, cell viability is lost almost completely within 24 h of PMA treatment following transfection. This protocol constitutes an optimized version of a previously published protocol by our group. It describes a procedure for transfecting premature THP-1 macrophages, which subsequently can be further differentiated into mature macrophages by PMA without a loss of cell viability. Transfection of THP-1 cells with plasmids or small interfering RNA (siRNA) is achieved by electroporation using the Lonza Nucleofector technology (Basel, Switzerland). This technique allows for the efficient nonviral delivery of plasmids, DNA, RNA, or siRNA into primary cells or cell lines even if the cells are not or are only slowly proliferating. Such cells are usually rather difficult to transfect by nonviral approaches. This means that only viral approaches would be left, which are expensive and labor-intensive and require laboratories complying with the respective safety regulations. The protocol described here is an efficient and convenient alternative.","['Maess, Marten B', 'Buers, Insa', 'Robenek, Horst', 'Lorkowski, Stefan']","['Maess MB', 'Buers I', 'Robenek H', 'Lorkowski S']","['Institute of Nutrition, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cold Spring Harb Protoc,Cold Spring Harbor protocols,101524530,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['2011/5/pdb.prot5612 [pii]', '10.1101/pdb.prot5612 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Protoc. 2011 May 1;2011(5):pdb.prot5612. doi: 10.1101/pdb.prot5612.,10.1101/pdb.prot5612 [doi] pdb.prot5612 [pii],20110501,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electroporation/methods', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism', 'Transfection/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss-of-function mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive severe combined immune deficiency. Here, we describe somatic gain-of-function mutations in IL7R in pediatric B and T acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The mutations cause either a serine-to-cysteine substitution at amino acid 185 in the extracellular domain (4 patients) or in-frame insertions and deletions in the transmembrane domain (35 patients). In B cell precursor leukemias, the mutations were associated with the aberrant expression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2), and the mutant IL-7R proteins formed a functional receptor with CRLF2 for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Biochemical and functional assays reveal that these IL7R mutations are activating mutations conferring cytokine-independent growth of progenitor lymphoid cells. A cysteine, included in all but three of the mutated IL-7R alleles, is essential for the constitutive activation of the receptor. This is the first demonstration of gain-of-function mutations of IL7R. Our current and recent observations of mutations in IL7R and CRLF2, respectively suggest that the addition of cysteine to the juxtamembranous domains is a general mechanism for mutational activation of type I cytokine receptors in leukemia.","['Shochat, Chen', 'Tal, Noa', 'Bandapalli, Obul R', 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Ganmore, Ithamar', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Kulozik, Andreas E', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Bercovich, Dani', 'Muckenthaler, Martina U', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Shochat C', 'Tal N', 'Bandapalli OR', 'Palmi C', 'Ganmore I', 'te Kronnie G', 'Cario G', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Kulozik AE', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M', 'Biondi A', 'Basso G', 'Bercovich D', 'Muckenthaler MU', 'Izraeli S']","['Childhood Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan 52621, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20110580 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20110580 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 May 9;208(5):901-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.20110580.

In mammalian cells, the current model posits that eIF6 release is triggered following phosphorylation of Ser 235 by activated protein kinase C. In contrast, genetic studies in yeast indicate a requirement for the ortholog of the SBDS (Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome) gene that is mutated in the inherited leukemia predisposition disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). Here, by isolating late cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunits from Sbds-deleted mice, we show that SBDS and the GTPase elongation factor-like 1 (EFL1) directly catalyze eIF6 removal in mammalian cells by a mechanism that requires GTP binding and hydrolysis by EFL1 but not phosphorylation of eIF6 Ser 235. Functional analysis of disease-associated missense variants reveals that the essential role of SBDS is to tightly couple GTP hydrolysis by EFL1 on the ribosome to eIF6 release. Furthermore, complementary NMR spectroscopic studies suggest unanticipated mechanistic parallels between this late step in 60S maturation and aspects of bacterial ribosome disassembly. Our findings establish a direct role for SBDS and EFL1 in catalyzing the translational activation of ribosomes in all eukaryotes, and define SDS as a ribosomopathy caused by uncoupling GTP hydrolysis from eIF6 release.","['Finch, Andrew J', 'Hilcenko, Christine', 'Basse, Nicolas', 'Drynan, Lesley F', 'Goyenechea, Beatriz', 'Menne, Tobias F', 'Gonzalez Fernandez, Africa', 'Simpson, Paul', ""D'Santos, Clive S"", 'Arends, Mark J', 'Donadieu, Jean', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine', 'Costanzo, Michael', 'Boone, Charles', 'McKenzie, Andrew N', 'Freund, Stefan M V', 'Warren, Alan J']","['Finch AJ', 'Hilcenko C', 'Basse N', 'Drynan LF', 'Goyenechea B', 'Menne TF', 'Gonzalez Fernandez A', 'Simpson P', ""D'Santos CS"", 'Arends MJ', 'Donadieu J', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C', 'Costanzo M', 'Boone C', 'McKenzie AN', 'Freund SM', 'Warren AJ']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge CB2 0QH, United Kingdom. ajw@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/06/28 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['25/9/917 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.623011 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2011 May 1;25(9):917-29. doi: 10.1101/gad.623011.,10.1101/gad.623011 [doi],,"['0 (EIF6 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Itgb4bp protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)', '0 (Sbds protein, mouse)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'Shwachman syndrome']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics/physiopathology', 'Catalysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/genetics/physiopathology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lipomatosis', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosome Subunits, Large, Eukaryotic', 'Ribosomes/*pathology', 'Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome']","['08-0183/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'R24 AI049393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'MC_U105161083/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U105178805/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MOP-102629/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '1R01HG005853-01/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG005853/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3084026,,,['Genes Dev. 2011 May 1;25(9):898-900.

This defect was recapitulated in vitro as Mtg16(-/-) Lineage(-)/Sca1(+)/c-Kit(+) (LSK) cells of the bone marrow or DN1 cells of the thymus failed to produce CD4(+)/CD8(+) cells in response to a Notch signal. Complementation of these defects by reexpressing Mtg16 showed that 3 highly conserved domains were somewhat dispensable for T-cell development but required the capacity of Mtg16 to suppress E2A-dependent transcriptional activation and to bind to the Notch intracellular domain.

The Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) expresses an alternative form of c-Abl, v-Abl, that transforms murine pro-B cells, resulting in acute leukemia and providing an experimental model for human disease. Gleevec (STI571) inhibits the Abl kinase and has shown great utility against CML and ALL in humans, although its usefulness is limited by acquired resistance. Since STI571 is active against A-MuLV-transformed cells in vitro, we performed a retroviral cDNA library screen for genes that confer resistance to apoptosis induced by STI571. We found that forced expression of Cdk6 promotes continued cell division and decreased apoptosis of leukemic cells. We then determined that the transcription factor E2A negatively regulates Cdk6 transcription in leukemic pro-B cells and that the v-Abl kinase stimulates Cdk6 expression via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1-dependent pathway. Finally, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor PD0332991 can act synergistically with STI571 to enhance leukemic cell death, suggesting a potential role for CDK6 inhibitors in the treatment of STI571-resistant CML or ALL.","['Kuo, Tracy C', 'Chavarria-Smith, Joseph E', 'Huang, Dan', 'Schlissel, Mark S']","['Kuo TC', 'Chavarria-Smith JE', 'Huang D', 'Schlissel MS']","['University of California, Berkeley, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01349-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01349-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2011 Jul;31(13):2566-76. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01349-10.

In this article, preclinical data show that the combination is more effective than single agents both in cultured cells and in vivo. Combination index data analysis shows that this combination is highly synergistic at inhibiting anchorage-dependent growth of breast cancer cells. This synergistic interaction is also observed with structurally unrelated inhibitors of Akt (MK-2206) and farnesyltransferase (FTI-2153). The triciribine/tipifarnib synergistic effects are seen with several cancer cell lines including those from breast, leukemia, multiple myeloma and lung tumors with different genetic alterations such as K-Ras, B-Raf, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), p53 and pRb mutations, PTEN, pRB and Ink4a deletions, and ErbB receptor overexpression. Furthermore, the combination is synergistic at inhibiting anchorage-independent growth and at inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The combination is also more effective at inhibiting the Akt/mTOR/S6 kinase pathway. In an ErbB2-driven breast tumor transgenic mouse model, the combination, but not single agent, treatment with triciribine and tipifarnib induces significant breast tumor regression.

METHODS: The cohort included 32,550 veterans having had at least one dosimetry recording. Current vital status was collected from the National Register of Identification of Physical People and causes of death data from the national causes of death database. Total mortality and mortality by cause were compared with mortality of the French population using standardized mortality ratios (SMR). To test the effect of a dosimeter recording higher than the threshold (0.2 mSv), i.e., no null dosimetry, the mortality of veterans was compared inside the cohort, using standardized ratios and Poisson regression models. RESULTS: The mortality analysis was performed among 26,524 men, of whom 8% had had at least one non-null dosimeter. Five thousand four hundred and ninety-two (21%) veterans died before December 31, 2008 and causes were available for nearly 97% of these deaths. Comparing the mortality between the cohort and the French population highlighted a deficit of mortality, for all causes, by cancer and for radiation-induced pathologies; these results were related to the ""healthy worker effect"". The data showed that all causes mortality and cancer mortality of the cohort of veterans with no null dosimeter were not different from those of other veterans, but also showed an excess of hematological malignancies in this sub-population: this excess was significant in the regression model (RR=1.82; CI 95% [1.6-2.0]). CONCLUSION: Among veterans with an external dosimeter monitoring recording, presence on the sites of CEP from 1966 to 1996 does not constitute a factor of increased mortality compared with the national population. However, an increased risk was observed for mortality by hematological malignancies among veterans with no null dosimetry.

The patient was diagnosed initially with a myelodysplastic syndrome, with a del(20)(q11.2q13.3) as the sole abnormality identified by karyotyping. The patient progressed to acute myeloid leukemia with no change to the G-banded karyotype. The 1.3 Mb deletion on the long arm of one chromosome 5 was confirmed to have been present both at presentation with myelodysplastic syndrome and at transformation. This is an interesting case because there are few array studies identifying cryptic 5q deletions, and the study of these small deletions helps to refine the common deleted region. This case, together with previously published studies, suggests that the proximal boundary of the common deleted region may lie within the KDM3B gene.","['MacKinnon, Ruth N', 'Kannourakis, George', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Campbell, Lynda J']","['MacKinnon RN', 'Kannourakis G', 'Wall M', 'Campbell LJ']","[""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St. Vincent's Hospital (Melbourne), Fitzroy, VIC, Australia. ruth.mackinnon@svhm.org.au""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(11)00020-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2011 Apr;204(4):187-94. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.02.001.,10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.02.001 [doi],,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria for evaluating therapeutic response were published in 2006. We report the results of 4 consecutive pilot trials evaluating the feasibility and estimating the interrater reliability and minimum detectable change of these response criteria. Hematology-oncology clinicians with limited experience in applying the NIH cGVHD response criteria (n = 34) participated in a 2.5-hour training session on response evaluation in cGVHD. Feasibility and interrater reliability between subspecialty cGVHD experts and this panel of clinician raters were examined in a sample of 25 children and adults with cGVHD. The minimum detectable change was calculated using the standard error of measurement. Clinicians' impressions of the brief training session, the photo atlas, and the response criteria documentation tools were generally favorable. Performing and documenting the full set of response evaluations required a median of 21 minutes (range: 12-60 minutes) per rater. The Schirmer tear test required the greatest time of any single test (median: 9 minutes). Overall, interrater agreement for skin and oral manifestations was modest; however, in the third and fourth trials, the agreement between clinicians and experts for all dimensions except movable sclerosis approached satisfactory values. In the final 2 trials, the threshold for defining change exceeding measurement error was 19% to 22% body surface area (BSA) for erythema, 18% to 26% BSA for movable sclerosis, 17% to 21% BSA for nonmovable sclerosis, and 2.1 to 2.6 points on the 15-point NIH Oral cGHVD scale. Agreement between clinician-expert pairs was moderate to substantial for the measures of functional capacity and for the gastrointestinal and global cGVHD rating scales. These results suggest that the NIH response criteria are feasible for use, and these reliability estimates are encouraging, because they were observed following a single 2.5-hour training session given at multiple transplant centers, with no opportunity for iterative training and calibration. Research is needed to evaluate inter- and intrarater reliability in larger samples, and to evaluate these response criteria as predictors of outcomes in clinical trials.","['Mitchell, Sandra A', 'Jacobsohn, David', 'Thormann Powers, Kimberly E', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Cowen, Edward W', 'Schubert, Mark', 'Turner, Maria L', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Martin, Paul', 'Bishop, Michael R', 'Baird, Kristin', 'Bolanos-Meade, Javier', 'Boyd, Kevin', 'Fall-Dickson, Jane M', 'Gerber, Lynn H', 'Guadagnini, Jean-Pierre', 'Imanguli, Matin', 'Krumlauf, Michael C', 'Lawley, Leslie', 'Li, Li', 'Reeve, Bryce B', 'Clayton, Janine Austin', 'Vogelsang, Georgia B', 'Pavletic, Steven Z']","['Mitchell SA', 'Jacobsohn D', 'Thormann Powers KE', 'Carpenter PA', 'Flowers ME', 'Cowen EW', 'Schubert M', 'Turner ML', 'Lee SJ', 'Martin P', 'Bishop MR', 'Baird K', 'Bolanos-Meade J', 'Boyd K', 'Fall-Dickson JM', 'Gerber LH', 'Guadagnini JP', 'Imanguli M', 'Krumlauf MC', 'Lawley L', 'Li L', 'Reeve BB', 'Clayton JA', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Pavletic SZ']","['Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. mitchlls@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,2011/05/04 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00164-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Nov;17(11):1619-29. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.04.002.

Arsenic and cobalt are principally derived from erosion of volcanic rocks in the local mountains and tungsten and uranium are derived from erosion of granitic rocks in headwater reaches of the Carson River. Radon and 210Po originate from radioactive decay of uranium in the sediments. Arsenic, aluminum, cobalt, iron, and manganese concentrations in household dust suggest it is derived from the local soils. Excess zinc and chromium in the dust are probably derived from the vacuum cleaner used to collect the dust, or household sources such as the furnace. Some samples have more than 5 times more cobalt in the dust than in the local soil, but whether the source of the excess cobalt is anthropogenic or natural cannot be determined with the available data. Cobalt concentrations are low in groundwater, but arsenic, uranium, radon, and 210Po concentrations often exceed human-health standards, and sometime greatly exceed them. Exposure to radon and its decay products in drinking water can vary significantly depending on when during the day that the water is consumed. Although the data suggests there have been no long term changes in groundwater chemistry that corresponds to the Lahontan Valley leukemia cluster, the occurrence of the very unusual leukemia cluster in an area with numerous 210Po and arsenic contaminated wells is striking, particularly in conjunction with the exceptionally high levels of urinary tungsten in Lahontan Valley residents. Additional research is needed on potential exposure pathways involving food or inhalation, and on synergistic effects of mixtures of these natural contaminants on susceptibility to development of leukemia.","['Seiler, Ralph']",['Seiler R'],"['US Geological Survey, 2730 N.

Cell proliferation was analyzed by WST-1 assay, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry and TUNEL, XIAP mRNA expression from 5 - 100 nmol/L by RT-PCR, and XIAP protein expression by SP immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: K562 cells were treated with bortezomib at different concentrations for 24 h respectively, the cells growth was significantly inhibited with inhibition rates from (13. 6 +/- 0. 2)% to (81. 4 +/- 0. 1)%, respectively, being markedly higher than that of control (1. 2 +/- 0. 1)% (P < 0.05). IC(50) was 24. 6 nmol/L of bortezomib treated for 24 h. When K562 cells were treated with 30 nmol/L of bortezomib for 12 - 48 h, the inhibition rates were (29. 1 +/- 0. 9)% to (59. 8 +/- 1. 2)%, respectively, the differences being statistically significant (P < 0.05) between 12 h group and 24 h group, while there was no statistical difference between 24 h, 36 h and 48 h groups. K562 cells treated with 30 nmol/L bortezomib for 24 h showed nuclear condensation, nuclear margination, nuclear fragmentation, cytoplasmic vacuoles and a large number of apoptotic body formation. The apoptotic cells rate was 83. 67% in bortezomib treated group, and 2. 33% in untreated group (P < 0.05). The expression of XIAP mRNA was decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression of its protein was down-regulated. CONCLUSION: Bortezomib can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells, and induce apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of XIAP, providing the laboratory evidence for the targeted therapy in acute leukemia.","['Shao, Ming', 'Sun, Ling', 'Cui, Xue-yan', 'Han, Xue-fei', 'Chen, Sheng-mei', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Ling, Zhi']","['Shao M', 'Sun L', 'Cui XY', 'Han XF', 'Chen SM', 'Wang F', 'Zhang H', 'Ling Z']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,2011/05/04 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Mar;32(3):182-6.,,,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: miRNAs expression profile was analyzed by gene chip in 49 newly diagnosed childhood ALL and 12 primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) cases (as control group). Abnormal expression of miRNAs was verified by qRT-PCR. The correlation of miRNAs expression pattern with indicators predicting early prednisone response and relapse within a year was analyzed. RESULTS: Specific expression of miRNAs profiles associated with prednisone response and early relapse in childhood ALL was identified. Eight miRNAs (miR-18a, miR-532, miR-218, miR-625, miR-193a, miR-638, miR-550 and miR-633) could distinguish prednisone sensitive from insensitive. The early relapse of newly diagnosed patients with either high-risk or non-high-risk clinical types had some characteristics of abnormal expression of miRNAs, including miR-7, miR-216 and let-7i upregulated, while miR-486, miR-191, miR-150, miR-487 and miR-342 downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: The initial screening reveals miRNAs differentially expressed from normal in ALL suggesting the potential roles of them in leukemogenesis. MiRNAs expression signatures may be useful for predicting prognosis and relapse in childhood ALL and directing personalized treatment.","['Xu, Ling', 'Liang, Yan-ni', 'Luo, Xue-qun', 'Liu, Xiao-dan', 'Guo, Hai-xia']","['Xu L', 'Liang YN', 'Luo XQ', 'Liu XD', 'Guo HX']","['The Centre of Medical Research of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,2011/05/04 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Mar;32(3):178-81.,,,"['0 (MIRN532 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Transcriptome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis is likely to be activated in response to these stresses. Apoptosis due to intrinsic stresses is regulated by pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. While the role of the Bcl-2 family in apoptosis of rodent islets is becoming increasingly understood, little is known about which of these molecules are expressed or required for apoptosis of human islets. This study investigated the expression of the Bcl-2 family of molecules in isolated human islets. RNA and protein lysates were extracted from human islets immediately postisolation. At the same time, standard quality control assays including viability staining and beta-cell content were performed on each islet preparation. Microarrays, RT-PCR, and Western blotting were performed on islet RNA and protein. The prosurvival molecules Bcl-xl and Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2, were highly expressed. The multidomain proapoptotic effector molecule Bax was expressed at higher levels than Bak. Proapoptotic BH3-only molecules were expressed at low levels, with Bid being the most abundant. The proapoptotic molecules BNIP3, BNIP3L, and Beclin-1 were all highly expressed, indicating exposure of islets to oxygen and nutrient deprivation during isolation. Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of expression levels of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in isolated human islets. Knowledge of which molecules are expressed will guide future research to understand the apoptotic pathways activated during isolation or after transplantation. This is crucial for the design of methods to achieve improved transplantation outcomes.","['Campbell, Peter D', 'Weinberg, Anita', 'Chee, Jonathan', 'Mariana, Lina', 'Ayala, Rochelle', 'Hawthorne, Wayne J', ""O'Connell, Philip J"", 'Loudovaris, Thomas', 'Cowley, Mark J', 'Kay, Thomas W', 'Grey, Shane T', 'Thomas, Helen E']","['Campbell PD', 'Weinberg A', 'Chee J', 'Mariana L', 'Ayala R', 'Hawthorne WJ', ""O'Connell PJ"", 'Loudovaris T', 'Cowley MJ', 'Kay TW', 'Grey ST', 'Thomas HE']","[""St Vincent's Institute, Fitzroy, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,2011/05/04 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ct0273campbell [pii]', '10.3727/096368911X566262 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2012;21(1):49-60. doi: 10.3727/096368911X566262.

There are rare stem cells within the leukemic population that possess extensive proliferation and self-renewal capacity not found in the majority of the leukemic cells. These leukemic stem cells are necessary and sufficient to maintain the leukemia. While the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of CML was first suggested over 30 years ago, recently CML-initiating cells beyond HSCs are also being investigated. We have previously isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1(+)) cells carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene from the bone marrow of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) patients with hemangioblast property. Here, we showed that CML patient-derived Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs had normal morphology, phenotype and karyotype but appeared impaired in immuno-modulatory function. The capacity of patient Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and proliferation was impaired in vitro. CML patient-derived MSCs have impaired immuno-modulatory functions, suggesting that the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and immune response may originate from MSCs rather than HSCs. MSCs might be a potential target for developing efficacious cures for CML.","['Xishan, Zhu', 'Guangyu, An', 'Yuguang, Song', 'Hongmei, Zhang']","['Xishan Z', 'Guangyu A', 'Yuguang S', 'Hongmei Z']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100038, PR China. mountain.red@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-30-47 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-30-47 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2011 May 2;30:47. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-30-47.,10.1186/1756-9966-30-47 [doi],20110502,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hemangioblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunomodulation', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,PMC3095541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, no suitable approach is available to repress the development of multiple oncomirs in cancer cells. Herein, we report that argonaute 2 (AGO2) could be a unique molecule to regulate the development of multiple oncomirs in cancer cells. Knock-down of AGO2 by custom-made AGO2 siRNA resulted in the induction of apoptosis in myeloid leukaemia cells (HL-60).

Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the influence of conventional as well as modern prognostic factors on overall survival (OS) and time to therapy (TTT) of patients with CLL. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data of all patients consecutively entered into the databases of five large academic centres in the Czech Republic. The total of 1300 patients was included in the analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Through the use of uniparametric analysis, it was determined that gender, clinical stage Rai II-IV, unmutated IgVH status, deletion 17p (for both 5% and 20% cut-off), deletion 11q, ZAP-70 positivity and high expression of CD38 had significant negative influence on OS. TTT was significantly influenced by gender, Rai stage, IgVH status, deletion 11q, deletion 17p, deletion 13q and CD38 expression. Multiparametric analysis revealed that OS was significantly influenced by gender, age, IgVH status and deletion 17p. If only patients who died of CLL were included, gender, age, Rai stage, IgVH status and deletion 17p had significant influence on OS. Based on our results, the examination of biological prognostic markers can give an insight into the possible disease evolution in daily clinical practice. Biological prognostic markers are, however, not ready (maybe except deletion 17p in younger patients) to be used for guidance of therapy at least outside of clinical trials.","['Doubek, Michael', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Obrtlikova, Petra', 'Smolej, Lukas', 'Cmunt, Eduard', 'Schwarz, Jiri', 'Brejcha, Martin', 'Kozmon, Petr', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Pospisil, Zdenek', 'Trneny, Marek']","['Doubek M', 'Mayer J', 'Obrtlikova P', 'Smolej L', 'Cmunt E', 'Schwarz J', 'Brejcha M', 'Kozmon P', 'Pospisilova S', 'Brychtova Y', 'Pospisil Z', 'Trneny M']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. mdoubek@fnbrno.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01639.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Aug;87(2):130-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01639.x.,10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01639.x [doi],,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/etiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood']",,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the results of treatment of consecutive patients with CML at ten major centres during 2000-2008. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data reporting was retrospective in 2000-2004 and prospective from 2005 on. A total of 661 patients [301 women and 360 men; median age 51 (range, 15-83)] with Ph+CML were registered. The median follow-up was 46.1 months (0-122.2). RESULTS: Most patients were treated with first- (379; 57.3%) or second-line (193; 29.2%) imatinib; some of the patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) (83; 12.6%), but 6.1% were treated with other modalities [40 patients; median age 66 (range, 32-83)]. The probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years, according to Kaplan and Meier, was 88.9%, 77.5% and 68.7% for chronic-phase patients treated with first-line imatinib, second-line imatinib and first-line AHSCT, respectively, but only 25.2% for patients receiving other modalities. The OS was dependent on the disease phase and Sokal, Hasford and European group for blood and marrow transplantation (EBMT) risk scores (P<0.001; each). Only 46.2% of deaths in patients treated with other modalities were attributable to CML. Elderly patients over 65 years achieved similar response rates and progression-free survival to the younger ones. There was a trend for inferior results of AHSCT performed after the failure of imatinib (P=0.075), probably as a result of differences in EBMT risk scores (P<0.001).

In these patients, the prognosis is not as poor as in those cases in which the cytopenia is due to a massive bone marrow infiltration by the disease, and their treatment requires special considerations. For these reasons, the diagnosis of autoimmune cytopenia should be entertained in any patient with CLL presenting with cytopenia. In patients with autoimmune cytopenia and CLL, treatment is as for idiopathic autoimmune cytopenia, with most patients responding to corticosteroids. For patients not responding to corticosteroids, splenectomy is a reasonable treatment choice. Monoclonal antibodies and thrombopoietin analogues have shown enough activity to support their use, especially within clinical studies, in selected cases not responding to corticosteroids and before splenectomy. In patients with resistant immune cytopenia, the most effective treatment is that of the underlying CLL. Fear of fludarabine-associated AIHA is no longer appropriate in the age of chemo-immunotherapy. Finally, prospective studies are required to better identify the optimal therapy for these patients.","['Hodgson, Kate', 'Ferrer, Gerardo', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Hodgson K', 'Ferrer G', 'Pereira A', 'Moreno C', 'Montserrat E']","[""Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institute d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2011/05/04 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08707.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jul;154(1):14-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08707.x.

Accordingly, efficient high-content methods to study non-adherent cells are needed not only to improve diagnostics but also for early screening of targeted drugs. A plate-based assay using adhesion reagents for multiparametric measurement with single non-adherent and non-anchored cells in a large cell population in high-content cytometry was developed and optimized. The cells preserved their identity even during extensive biomanipulations. The proposed method is highly robust for better imaging and can be used in various assays in different cellular backgrounds. Furthermore, as exemplary experiments, novel optimized assay protocols were used to study extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity after cell inhibition with imatinib in chronic myelocytic leukemia K562 cells, revealing the phosphorylation kinetics of ERK MAPK. The results showed that the proposed assay detects kinase phosphorylation with good sensitivity and may be used in rapid drug screening.","['Wang, Chen', 'Wang, Lili', 'Zhao, Changqi']","['Wang C', 'Wang L', 'Zhao C']","['Beijing Key Lab of Gene Engineering Drugs & Biological Technology, College of Life Science, Beijing Normal University, China. wangll63@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United Arab Emirates,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,9810948,2011/05/04 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2011/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CCHTS/E- Pub/00169 [pii]', '10.2174/138620711796367247 [doi]']",ppublish,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2011 Aug;14(7):583-9. doi: 10.2174/138620711796367247.,,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*instrumentation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of WK234 in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cell line and to investigate possible mechanisms of its action. The results show that WK234 inhibited K562 cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. WK234 increased cytochrome C release and caspase-3 cleavage, which indicates that it induced apoptosis via mitochondria- and caspase-mediated pathways. Western blotting showed that PKCbeta1, PKCbeta2, and their phosphorylation levels were effectively decreased after 2-4 h of WK234 treatment. Meanwhile the phosphorylation status of PKCbeta downstream proteins, glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta (GSK3alpha/beta) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), were inhibited.

We retrospectively genotyped 181 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated with the Chinese Children's Leukemia Group protocol. In standard- and medium-risk treatment branches, the 677T carriers (CT + TT) had a higher risk of developing thrombocytopenia when compared with carriers of the CC genotype (odds ratio [OR] 5.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-23.01, p = 0.017). The 1298AC/CC genotypes were associated with a decrease in skin toxicity, as compared with the common AA genotype (p = 0.037). An estimation of haplotype frequencies showed that there was no 677T-1298C haplotype in the population. A lower frequency of anemia (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.90, p = 0.025) and lower MTX level (p = 0.044) were observed in patients with the 677C-1298C haplotype than in those without. High plasma MTX level was correlated with anemia (p = 0.011) and neutropenia (p = 0.044). In the high-risk group, the polymorphisms or plasma MTX levels were not correlated with any toxicity.

The role of angiogenesis, as an indicator of higher malignant potential in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is not clear at the moment. Morphometric characteristics of microvessels in lymph node sections, in previously untreated patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), were studied and relationship between angiogenesis and histological malignancy grade of NHL was also evaluated. Lymph node biopsies samples of 30 newly diagnosed patients with SLL/CLL (n=30) and DLBCL (n=30) were studied. All samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution and embedded in paraffin. Microvessels were visualized by immunohistochemical staining for anti F-8 antibody. In the area showing the most intense vascularization (i.e. the ""hot spot""), microvessel density (MVD), total vascular area (TVA), as well as the size related parameters were estimated, by using image analysis program ""analysSIS'. Number and size-related microvessels angiogenic morphometric parameters were statistically higher in group with DLBCL compared with SLL/CLL: MVD (p = 0.002), TVA (p < 0.0001), area (p < 0.0001), perimeter (p < 0.0001), minor axis length (p < 0.0001) and major axis length (p < 0.0001). It is to be noted that positive correlation existed between TVA and MVD in DLBCL and SLL/CLL.

However, surviving patients are at risk for developing a variety of late sequelae. This analysis aimed to retrospectively characterize late effects after TBI in adults treated in a single center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients >/= 18 years treated with fractionated TBI (4-12 Gy) between 1996 and 2008 were included in this study. Treatment data were collected retrospectively from the treating departments. Late effects were evaluated using the clinic charts and/or were obtained from the general practitioners using a standardized questionnaire. Analyses were performed by calculation of the cumulative incidences using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test. RESULTS: A total of 308 patients >/= 18 years were treated including a TBI of whom 78 patients were excluded from further analysis due to death within less than 1 year after TBI. Patients suffered from leukemia in most cases. Late toxicity follow-up was available in 120 patients (mean age 46.1 years; range, 18-70 years) after a mean follow-up of 23 months (range, 12-96 months). The cumulative incidences (CI) at 3 years were 28% for pulmonary event, 8% for pulmonary toxicity, 25% for kidney toxicity, 8% for cataract, 17% for bone toxicity, and 10% for secondary malignancy. The CI of bone toxicity was higher in female than in male patients (p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Late effects after TBI in the context of allogeneous stem cell or bone marrow transplantation can frequently be observed. Regular follow-up examinations are advised for the early registration and treatment of adverse effects.","['Bolling, Tobias', 'Kreuziger, David Christoph', 'Ernst, Iris', 'Elsayed, Hassan', 'Willich, Normann']","['Bolling T', 'Kreuziger DC', 'Ernst I', 'Elsayed H', 'Willich N']","['Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital of Munster, Munster, Germany.

We found that this drug inhibited the integration of the viral DNA into the host genome in acutely infected cells. This compound also reduced the level of viral RNA and specifically inhibited viral protein synthesis in NIH/3T3/Mo-MuLV chronically infected cells while no effect on the cellular beta-actin was observed. Since tyrphostin AG-555 inhibited both the early stages (integration process) and the late stages (viral protein synthesis) in the virus life cycle, it offers a potential advantage over other compounds which affect only one stage in the viral life cycle.

Autoimmunity, sometimes, is reflected through the production of autoantibodies to various self antigens leading to cellular malfunction or destruction. In the current study we employ such autoantibodies for the treatment of cancer originated from the respective normal cells. This concept is wide and entails many autoimmune disorders and diversity of malignant conditions. To illustrate the therapeutic and practical potential we depicted four examples: vitiligo and melanoma - vitiligo is considered dermatologic autoimmune disorder presented as depigmented skin areas. The destruction of the pigmented cells (melanocytes) is mediated by autoantibodies. We have purified these anti-melanocyte antibodies from patients with vitiligo and showed their cytotoxic effect towards malignant melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo; anti-phospholipid syndrome (APLS) and cancer-cancer cells differ from normal cells by the expression of phosphatydilserine (PS) on their outer membrane surface. We have used such anti-PS autoantibodies, derived from patients with APLS, as effective treatment for melanoma in a murine system; Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and hematological malignancies - in patients with AIHA, the red blood cells (RBC) destruction is mediated by binding of autoantibodies to RBC. We have shown the specific binding of these anti-RBC autoantibodies to RBC and to malignant cells of the erythroid lineage. Thus, these autoantibodies may have diagnostic/therapeutic potential for conditions such as erythroleukemia and polycythemia vera; anti-lymphocyte antibodies and lymphoproliferative diseases - in SLE and other systemic autoimmune conditions autoantibodies directed against lymphocytes can be found. These cytotoxic antibodies can be targeted against lymphocytes of lymphoproliferative diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or lymphoma. The diversity of autoimmune diseases provides a great source for human preformed highly specific autoantibodies which can be used as an effective immunotherapy by themselves, for diagnostic purposes, as a cell specific carrier conjugated to other cytotoxic agents and in combined therapy in the combat against cancer.","['Fishman, P', 'Merimsky, O', 'Shoenfeld, Y']","['Fishman P', 'Merimsky O', 'Shoenfeld Y']","['TEL AVIV UNIV, SACKLER FAC MED, TEL AVIV MED CTR, DEPT ONCOL, IL-49100 PETAH TIQWA, ISRAEL.

In this study, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we found that both endogenous interleukin-1 alpha and beta (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta) mRNA were up-regulated upon TNF-alpha induction. Exogenous IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta also inhibited the growth as well as induced the differentiation of JCS cells, with IL-1 beta exerting a greater growth-inhibitory effect. Neutralizing anti-IL-1 alpha, anti-IL-1 beta and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies were further used to elucidate the role of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in JCS cell differentiation. The results show that the IL-1 alpha-induced monocytic differentiation of JCS cells was effectively blocked by anti-IL-1 beta as well as anti-IL-1 beta antibodies and to a lesser extent by anti-TNF-alpha antibody. In contrast, the differentiation-inducing effect of IL-1 beta on JCS cells was only blocked by anti-IL-1 beta antibody but not by anti-IL-1 alpha or anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Finally, the TNF-alpha-induced monocytic differentiation of JCS cells was significantly blocked by anti-TNF-alpha and to a lesser extent by anti-IL-1 alpha and anti-IL-1 beta antibodies. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-1 beta alone may directly trigger JCS cell differentiation whereas the differentiation-inducing effect of IL-1 alpha may be via the endogenous production of IL-1 beta and/or TNF-alpha. In addition, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta may be involved, at least in part, in TNF-alpha-induced monocytic differentiation of the JCS leukemia cells.","['Chan, S', 'Fung, M', 'Mak, N', 'Leung, K']","['Chan S', 'Fung M', 'Mak N', 'Leung K']","['CHINESE UNIV HONG KONG,DEPT BIOCHEM,SHATIN,NT,HONG KONG.

The cytotoxic effect of vesnarinone against HL-60 cells did not increase, even at concentrations as high as (50 mu g/ml). The cytotoxicity of DXR, however, was enhanced after being combined with 30 mu g/ml of vesnarinone. The intracellular level of DXR increased when DXR was administered after incubation with vesnarinone and the efflux of DXR was delayed when the cells were incubated in the presence of vesnarinone after DXR exposure. Flow cytometry showed that the combination of DXR and vesnarinone increased the cell population below the G(0)/G(1) region. Vesnarinone induced DNA ladder formation, but only when these cells were incubated for 72 h, while in addition, when DXR was combined with vesnarinone, the DNA ladder formation was enhanced.

Notwithstanding some relevant improvements in results, chemotherapy remains often a palliative approach. The improved knowledge of the biology of cancer, and of molecular mechanisms and specific targets, has recently modified the approach to various tumors. In particular, the identification of a single and specific genetic alteration in some tumors such as myeloid chronic leukaemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) led to the development of imatinib, a ""target"" drug with a multikinase inhibitor activity towards the specific genetic alteration; this unique opportunity is not applicable to other tumors, because usually tumors have multiple genetic alterations with very complex molecular pathways. The development of drugs with a multitarget action is probably the best approach to the majority of human cancers, but other possibility are the combination of multiple agents, each with known selective activity towards a specific molecular target, or the choice of a chemotherapic drug in combination with one or more molecularly targeted drugs.

In particular, mutations in JAK2 can result in the constitutive activation of STAT transcription factors and lead to oncogenic growth. JAK kinases are established Hsp90 client proteins and here we show that the novel small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib (formerly STA-9090) exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo activity in a range of solid and hematological tumor cells that are dependent on JAK2 activity for growth and survival. Of note, ganetespib treatment results in sustained depletion of JAK2, including the constitutively active JAK2(V617F) mutant, with subsequent loss of STAT activity and reduced STAT-target gene expression. In contrast, treatment with the pan-JAK inhibitor P6 results in only transient effects on these processes. Further differentiating these modes of intervention, RNA and protein expression studies show that ganetespib additionally modulates cell cycle regulatory proteins, while P6 does not. The concomitant impact of ganetespib on both cell growth and cell division signaling translates to potent antitumor efficacy in mouse models of xenografts and disseminated JAK/STAT-driven leukemia. Overall, our findings support Hsp90 inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach for combating diseases dependent on JAK/STAT signaling, with the multimodal action of ganetespib demonstrating advantages over JAK-specific inhibitors.","['Proia, David A', 'Foley, Kevin P', 'Korbut, Tim', 'Sang, Jim', 'Smith, Don', 'Bates, Richard C', 'Liu, Yuan', 'Rosenberg, Alex F', 'Zhou, Dan', 'Koya, Keizo', 'Barsoum, James', 'Blackman, Ronald K']","['Proia DA', 'Foley KP', 'Korbut T', 'Sang J', 'Smith D', 'Bates RC', 'Liu Y', 'Rosenberg AF', 'Zhou D', 'Koya K', 'Barsoum J', 'Blackman RK']","['Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp., Lexington, Massachusetts, United States of America.

Bone marrow aspirates were drawn at diagnosis, after 3, 6, 12, 18 months for haematological, cytofluorimetric, cytogenetic, biomolecular evaluation and cytokine measurement. Responder and non responder patients were defined according to the European LeukemiaNet recommendations. In responder patients (n = 32), the percentage of bone marrow CD20(+)CD5(+)sIgM(+) lymphocytes, and the plasma levels of IgM, were significantly higher, at 3 months and up to 9 months, than in non responders. These IgM reacted with O-linked sugars expressed by leukemic cells and could induce tumor cell apoptosis. In responder patients the stromal-derived factor-1 and the B-lymphocyte-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family significantly raised in the bone marrow after imatinib administration, together with the bone morphogenetic proteins-2 and -7.

It has been estimated that 10-20 million people are infected worldwide, but no successful treatment is available. Recently, the epidemiology of this virus was addressed in blood donors from Maputo, showing rates from 0.9 to 1.2%. However, the origin and impact of HTLV endemic in this population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the HTLV-1 molecular epidemiology in Mozambique and to investigate their relationship with HTLV-1 lineages circulating worldwide. METHODS: Blood donors and HIV patients were screened for HTLV antibodies by using enzyme immunoassay, followed by Western Blot. PCR and sequencing of HTLV-1 LTR region were applied and genetic HTLV-1 subtypes were assigned by the neighbor-joining method. The mean genetic distance of Mozambican HTLV-1 lineages among the genetic clusters were determined. Human mitochondrial (mt) DNA analysis was performed and individuals classified in mtDNA haplogroups. RESULTS: LTR HTLV-1 analysis demonstrated that all isolates belong to the Transcontinental subgroup of the Cosmopolitan subtype. Mozambican HTLV-1 sequences had a high inter-strain genetic distance, reflecting in three major clusters. One cluster is associated with the South Africa sequences, one is related with Middle East and India strains and the third is a specific Mozambican cluster. Interestingly, 83.3% of HIV/HTLV-1 co-infection was observed in the Mozambican cluster. The human mtDNA haplotypes revealed that all belong to the African macrohaplogroup L with frequencies representatives of the country. CONCLUSIONS: The Mozambican HTLV-1 genetic diversity detected in this study reveals that although the strains belong to the most prevalent and worldwide distributed Transcontinental subgroup of the Cosmopolitan subtype, there is a high HTLV diversity that could be correlated with at least 3 different HTLV-1 introductions in the country. The significant rate of HTLV-1a/HIV-1C co-infection, particularly in the Mozambican cluster, has important implications for the controls programs of both viruses.","['Vicente, Ana Carolina P', 'Gudo, Eduardo Samo', 'Iniguez, Alena Mayo', 'Otsuki, Koko', 'Bhatt, Nilesh', 'Abreu, Celina M', 'Vubil, Adolfo', 'Bila, Dulce', 'Ferreira, Orlando C', 'Tanuri, Amilcar', 'Jani, Ilesh V']","['Vicente AC', 'Gudo ES', 'Iniguez AM', 'Otsuki K', 'Bhatt N', 'Abreu CM', 'Vubil A', 'Bila D', 'Ferreira OC', 'Tanuri A', 'Jani IV']","['Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/07/29 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2010/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pntd.0001038 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2011 Apr 12;5(4):e1038. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001038.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0001038 [doi],20110412,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Blood Donors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Genotype', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mozambique/epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,PMC3075232,,['HTLV in Mozambique Study Group'],,,,,,,"['GENBANK/GU194504', 'GENBANK/GU194505', 'GENBANK/GU194506', 'GENBANK/GU194507', 'GENBANK/GU194508', 'GENBANK/GU194509', 'GENBANK/GU194510', 'GENBANK/GU194511', 'GENBANK/GU194512', 'GENBANK/GU194513', 'GENBANK/GU194514', 'GENBANK/GU194515', 'GENBANK/GU194516', 'GENBANK/GU194517', 'GENBANK/GU194518', 'GENBANK/GU194519', 'GENBANK/GU194520', 'GENBANK/GU194521', 'GENBANK/GU194522', 'GENBANK/GU194523', 'GENBANK/GU194524', 'GENBANK/GU194525', 'GENBANK/GU194526', 'GENBANK/GU194527', 'GENBANK/GU194528']",,"['Zango A', 'Mussa T', 'Chambo E', 'Amade N', 'Augusto Ado R', 'Sema C', 'Augusto O', 'Brindeiro R']","['Zango, Arlinda', 'Mussa, Tufaria', 'Chambo, Evelina', 'Amade, Nadia', 'Augusto, Angelo do Rosario', 'Sema, Cynthia', 'Augusto, Orvalho', 'Brindeiro, Rodrigo']",,,,,

Through deregulation of multiple cellular signaling pathways the viral Tax protein has a pivotal role in T-cell transformation. In response to stressful stimuli, cells mount a cellular stress response to limit the damage that environmental forces inflict on DNA or proteins. During stress response, cells postpone the translation of most cellular mRNAs, which are gathered into cytoplasmic mRNA-silencing foci called stress granules (SGs) and allocate their available resources towards the production of dedicated stress-management proteins. Here we demonstrate that Tax controls the formation of SGs and interferes with the cellular stress response pathway. In agreement with previous reports, we observed that Tax relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to environmental stress. We found that the presence of Tax in the cytoplasm of stressed cells prevents the formation of SGs and counteracts the shutoff of specific host proteins. Unexpectedly, nuclear localization of Tax promotes spontaneous aggregation of SGs, even in the absence of stress. Mutant analysis revealed that the SG inhibitory capacity of Tax is independent of its transcriptional abilities but relies on its interaction with histone deacetylase 6, a critical component of SGs. Importantly, the stress-protective effect of Tax was also observed in the context of HTLV-1 infected cells, which were shown to be less prone to form SGs and undergo apoptosis under arsenite exposure. These observations identify Tax as the first virally encoded inhibitory component of SGs and unravel a new strategy developed by HTLV-1 to deregulate normal cell processes. We postulate that inhibition of the stress response pathway by Tax would favor cell survival under stressful conditions and may have an important role in HTLV-1-induced cellular transformation.","['Legros, S', 'Boxus, M', 'Gatot, J S', 'Van Lint, C', 'Kruys, V', 'Kettmann, R', 'Twizere, J C', 'Dequiedt, F']","['Legros S', 'Boxus M', 'Gatot JS', 'Van Lint C', 'Kruys V', 'Kettmann R', 'Twizere JC', 'Dequiedt F']","['Center for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liege (ULg), Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011120 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.120 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Sep 22;30(38):4050-62. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.120.

The prognosis of patients with eosinophilic myocarditis is difficult to determine due the disease's rarity and varied causes; consequently, standard treatment has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of eosinophilic myocarditis, we retrospectively studied 7 patients fulfilling the criteria of the Japanese Circulation Society for eosinophilic myocarditis from among 64 patients admitted to our institution with eosinophilia over a 27-year period. RESULTS: The patients' ages at diagnosis ranged from 36 to 83 years (median: 52 years). The etiologies of the eosinophilic myocarditis were found to be idiopathic (3 patients), Churg-Strauss syndrome (2 patients), parasitic infection (1 patient) and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) (1 patient). In addition to treatment for the underlying disease, we also administered prednisolone at a dose appropriate to the disease severity (6 of 7 patients). The patient who was diagnosed with a parasitic infection was treated only with albendazole, because eosinophilic myocarditis was mild. The patient with CEL was positive for the FIP1 L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene and was treated with imatinib. Eosinophilic cationic protein was a useful marker for assessing disease activity and treatment efficacy. At the end of the study, of the seven patients treated, six were alive (86%), giving a mean survival time of 37 +/- 40 months (mean +/- SD). CONCLUSION: Because eosinophilic myocarditis has various etiologies, it is essential to identify the etiology of the underlying disease. In the majority of eosinophilic myocarditis patients, administration of prednisolone may be an effective therapeutic modality producing a good outcome.","['Kawano, Sayaka', 'Kato, Johji', 'Kawano, Noriaki', 'Yoshimura, Yuki', 'Masuyama, Hiroyuki', 'Fukunaga, Takashi', 'Sato, Yuichiro', 'Maruyama, Haruhiko', 'Mihara, Kenroh', 'Ueda, Akira', 'Toyoda, Kiyokazu', 'Imamura, Takuroh', 'Kitamura, Kazuo']","['Kawano S', 'Kato J', 'Kawano N', 'Yoshimura Y', 'Masuyama H', 'Fukunaga T', 'Sato Y', 'Maruyama H', 'Mihara K', 'Ueda A', 'Toyoda K', 'Imamura T', 'Kitamura K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Circulatory and Body Fluid Regulation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Japan. sayakawano23@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/50.4079 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.50.4079 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2011;50(9):975-81. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.50.4079.

The disease course is generally chronic, but some patients show disease progression (secondary myelofibrosis or accelerated phase) and/or leukemic transformation. We investigated chromosomal aberrations in 408 MPN samples using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays to identify disease-associated somatic lesions. Of 408 samples, 37.5% had a wild-type karyotype and 62.5% harbored at least 1 chromosomal aberration. We identified 25 recurrent aberrations that were found in 3 or more samples. An increased number of chromosomal lesions was significantly associated with patient age, as well as with disease progression and leukemic transformation, but no association was observed with MPN subtypes, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutational status, or disease duration. Aberrations of chromosomes 1q and 9p were positively associated with disease progression to secondary myelofibrosis or accelerated phase. Changes of chromosomes 1q, 7q, 5q, 6p, 7p, 19q, 22q, and 3q were positively associated with post-MPN acute myeloid leukemia.

We developed R723, an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits JAK2 activity in vitro by 50% at a concentration of 2nM, while having minimal effects on JAK3, TYK2, and JAK1 activity. R723 inhibited cytokine-independent CFU-E growth and constitutive activation of STAT5 in primary hematopoietic cells expressing JAK2V617F. In an anemia mouse model induced by phenylhydrazine, R723 inhibited erythropoiesis. In a leukemia mouse model using Ba/F3 cells expressing JAK2V617F, R723 treatment prolonged survival and decreased tumor burden. In V617F-transgenic mice that closely mimic human primary myelofibrosis, R723 treatment improved survival, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. R723 preferentially targeted the JAK2-dependent pathway rather than the JAK1- and JAK3-dependent pathways in vivo, and its effects on T and B lymphocytes were mild compared with its effects on myeloid cells.

Suicide gene therapy-that is, the genetic induction of a conditional suicide phenotype into donor T cells-allows dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD. Genetic modification with retroviral vectors after CD3 activation reduces T-cell alloreactivity.

Thymidine kinase-positive HA-1- and H-Y-specific CTLs were capable of self-renewal and differentiation into potent antileukemia effectors in vitro, and in vivo in a humanized mouse model.

Almost all chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma are caused by complicated interactions between gene and environment. One of the major hallmarks of those diseases is airway mucus overproduction (MO). Excessive mucus causes airway obstruction and significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Metals are major components of environmental particulate matters (PM). Among them, vanadium has been suggested to play an important role in PM-induced mucin production. Vanadium pentoxide (V(2)O(5)) is the most common commercial source of vanadium, and it has been associated with occupational chronic bronchitis and asthma, both of which are MO diseases. However, the underlying mechanism is not entirely clear. In this study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate the robust inductions of mucin production by V(2)O(5). Furthermore, the follow-up mechanistic study revealed a novel v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1-IKK-NF-kappaB pathway that mediated V(2)O(5)-induced mucin production. Most interestingly, the reactive oxygen species and the classical mucin-inducing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-MAPK pathway appeared not to be involved in this process.

However, WDR5 has not been considered to play a specific regulatory role in epigenetic programming of cell lineage because it is ubiquitously expressed. Previous work from our laboratory showed the appearance of histone H3K4me within smooth muscle cell (SMC)-marker gene promoters during the early stages of development of SMC from multipotential embryonic cells but did not elucidate the underlying mechanisms that mediate SMC-specific and locus-selective H3K4me. Results presented herein show that knockdown of WDR5 significantly decreased SMC-marker gene expression in cultured SMC differentiation systems and in Xenopus laevis embryos in vivo. In addition, we showed that WDR5 complexes within SMC progenitor cells contained H3K4 methyltransferase enzymatic activity and that knockdown of WDR5 selectively decreased H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 enrichment within SMC-marker gene promoter loci. Moreover, we present evidence that it is recruited to these gene promoter loci through interaction with a SMC-selective pituitary homeobox 2 (Pitx2). Taken together, studies provide evidence for a novel mechanism for epigenetic control of SMC-marker gene expression during development through interaction of WDR5, homeodomain proteins, and chromatin remodeling enzymes.","['Gan, Qiong', 'Thiebaud, Pierre', 'Theze, Nadine', 'Jin, Li', 'Xu, Guofeng', 'Grant, Patrick', 'Owens, Gary K']","['Gan Q', 'Thiebaud P', 'Theze N', 'Jin L', 'Xu G', 'Grant P', 'Owens GK']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)49063-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.233098 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 17;286(24):21853-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.233098.

Artemis harbors an endonuclease activity that trims both 5'- and 3'-ends of DSBs. To examine whether endonucleolytic trimming of terminally blocked DSBs by Artemis is a biologically relevant function, Artemis-deficient fibroblasts were stably complemented with either wild-type Artemis or an endonuclease-deficient D165N mutant. Wild-type Artemis completely restored resistance to gamma-rays, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin, and also restored DSB-repair proficiency in G0/G1 phase as measured by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and repair focus resolution. In contrast, cells expressing the D165N mutant, even at very high levels, remained as chemo/radiosensitive and repair deficient as the parental cells, as evidenced by persistent gamma-H2AX, 53BP1 and Mre11 foci that slowly increased in size and ultimately became juxtaposed with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies. In normal fibroblasts, overexpression of wild-type Artemis increased radioresistance, while D165N overexpression conferred partial repair deficiency following high-dose radiation. Restoration of chemo/radioresistance by wild-type, but not D165N Artemis suggests that the lack of endonucleolytic trimming of DNA ends is the principal cause of sensitivity to double-strand cleaving agents in Artemis-deficient cells.","['Mohapatra, Susovan', 'Kawahara, Misako', 'Khan, Imran S', 'Yannone, Steven M', 'Povirk, Lawrence F']","['Mohapatra S', 'Kawahara M', 'Khan IS', 'Yannone SM', 'Povirk LF']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/11/02 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['gkr257 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkr257 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Aug;39(15):6500-10. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr257.

One of these genes is TOP1MT, which encodes the mitochondrial DNA topoisomerase IB, involved in mtDNA relaxation. To elucidate TOP1MT regulation, we performed genome-wide profiling across the 60-cell line panel (the NCI-60) of the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program. We show that TOP1MT mRNA expression varies widely across these cell lines with the highest levels in leukemia (HL-60, K-562) and melanoma (SK-MEL-28), intermediate levels in breast (MDA-MB-231), ovarian (OVCAR) and colon (HCT-116, HCT-15, KM-12), and lowest levels in renal (ACHN, A498), prostate (PC-3, DU-145) and central nervous system cell lines (SF-539, SF-268, SF-295). Genome-wide analyses show that TOP1MT expression is significantly correlated with the other mitochondrial nuclear-encoded genes including the mitochondrial nucleoid genes, and demonstrate an overall co-regulation of the mitochondrial nuclear-encoded genes. We also find very high correlation between the expression of TOP1MT and the proto-oncogene MYC (c-myc). TOP1MT contains E-boxes (c-myc binding sites) and TOP1MT transcription follows MYC up- and down-regulation by MYC promoter activation and siRNA against MYC. Our finding implicates MYC as a novel regulator of TOP1MT and confirms its role as a master regulator of MNEGs and mitochondrial nucleoids.","['Zoppoli, Gabriele', 'Douarre, Celine', 'Dalla Rosa, Ilaria', 'Liu, Hongfang', 'Reinhold, William', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Zoppoli G', 'Douarre C', 'Dalla Rosa I', 'Liu H', 'Reinhold W', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20890, USA. gabriele.zoppoli@unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/11/02 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['gkr208 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkr208 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Aug;39(15):6620-32. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr208.

DATA SOURCES: Published literature identified through the MEDLINE(R), CINAHL(R), PsycINFO, and ERIC databases. DATA SYNTHESIS: Identified attributes of adherence to oral chemotherapy in childhood ALL included motivation, persistence, collaboration, mindfulness, cognitive capacity, flexibility, active participation, and identification of key participants in the process. Identified antecedents included a diagnosis of leukemia, the perceived value of adherence, and patient, family, and healthcare system-related factors. Identified consequences included the potential for maintaining optimal drug levels and improving disease outcome, as well as increased patient and caregiver esteem through active participation in the process. Adherence in the context of childhood ALL is defined as the active self-care behavior of taking (or having the responsibility for administering) daily oral chemotherapy, in collaboration with and according to the instructions of the healthcare provider over a defined, prolonged treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to oral chemotherapy in childhood ALL is a complex, multidimensional behavior that involves not only a willingness to follow the prescribed regimen over a prolonged period, but also the cognitive capacity and psychomotor skills to carry out the process. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should recognize the importance of clear communication of medication instructions, reinforcement of adherence-related behaviors, and assistance with common issues such as pill-swallowing skills and reminder systems in caring for children with ALL.","['Landier, Wendy']",['Landier W'],"['Center for Cancer Survivorship, Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA. wlandier@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['E6434R1766454757 [pii]', '10.1188/11.ONF.343-352 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2011 May;38(3):343-52. doi: 10.1188/11.ONF.343-352.,10.1188/11.ONF.343-352 [doi],,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Medication Adherence', 'Oncology Nursing/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*nursing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown to be highly and specifically expressed on circulating B lymphoma cells, but not on normal B cells. Here, we examined the potential of ROR1 as a diagnostic marker in initial and follow-up diagnostics of patients with CLL. 105 untreated and 72 treated patients, as well as healthy volunteers were examined using flow cytometry assays. Furthermore, we examined 10 patients with various B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL). ROR1 was detected using a directly labeled antibody. We detected uniformly high ROR1 expression levels in all CLL samples. In marked contrast, only low or absent ROR1 expression levels were found on B cells from healthy donors. ROR1 expression in CLL patients was not influenced by various treatments. Taken together, ROR1 may be used as a diagnostic marker for CLL. As it is the only antigen which can exclusively be detected on neoplastic B cells it may greatly increase both, specificity as well as sensitivity, in lymphoma diagnostics.","['Uhrmacher, Sabrina', 'Schmidt, Christina', 'Erdfelder, Felix', 'Poll-Wolbeck, Simon Jonas', 'Gehrke, Iris', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Uhrmacher S', 'Schmidt C', 'Erdfelder F', 'Poll-Wolbeck SJ', 'Gehrke I', 'Hallek M', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Koln Bonn, University at Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50937 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00193-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Oct;35(10):1360-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.04.006.

METHODS: In the present study, the genetic polymorphisms and expression of ABCG2 were analysed in blasts cells obtained from 184 Chinese patients with de novo acute leukaemia to investigate their possible association with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A novel synonymous ABCG2-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at exon 16 (13561218 C/T) and five known SNPs at exon 2 (13608835 G/A), exon 5 (13600044 C/A), intron 10 (13576005 C/T), intron 13 (13564503 C/T) and intron 14 (13563578 A/G) were identified with occurrence rates of 1.1%, 64.1%, 30.4%, 21.2%, 39.7% and 28.8%, respectively. We found that patients with the ABCG2 34GG genotype displayed longer disease free survival (DFS) (P<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (P<0.001) than those with the 34GA/AA genotypes. Furthermore, the DFS and OS were significantly diminished in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients with the 34GA/AA genotypes relative to those with the 34GG genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that these highly prevalent ABCG2 34GA/AA genotypes are associated with poor prognosis of Chinese patients with acute leukaemia and BMT patients.","['Wang, Fang', 'Liang, Yong-ju', 'Wu, Xing-ping', 'Chen, Li-ming', 'To, Kenneth Kin Wah', 'Dai, Chun-ling', 'Yan, Yan-yan', 'Wang, Yan-sheng', 'Tong, Xiu-zhen', 'Fu, Li-wu']","['Wang F', 'Liang YJ', 'Wu XP', 'Chen LM', 'To KK', 'Dai CL', 'Yan YY', 'Wang YS', 'Tong XZ', 'Fu LW']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00246-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 Sep;47(13):1990-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.032.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Registrations of children on the National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) who were diagnosed with cancer and died during 1999-2006 in England were linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and to death certificates. Multivariable logistic modelling was used to assess factors that influence dying at home or in hospital. RESULTS: 1864 (96%) of children with cancer registrations were linked to HES records. The validation of hospital as a place of death and ethnicity between data sources was good, although anomalies within HES data exist. Similar proportions of children are dying at home (45%) and in hospital (47%), and the percentage dying in a hospice or care home increased from 2% to 10%. Of the children who died in hospital, 74% were admitted as emergencies or as a transfer from another hospital. Greater proportions of children were diagnosed with a leukaemia or lymphoma, those dying within six months of diagnosis, Asian and Black children, those from a deprived background and those not treated in a CCLG centre died in a hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of hospital care varied considerably by type of cancer, death within six months of diagnosis, ethnicity and deprivation. Further research is required to elucidate explanations for these patterns and to evaluate methods to increase the proportion of children dying at home who wish to do so.","['Shah, Anjali', 'Diggens, Nicole', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Murphy, Dermot', 'Passmore, Jane', 'Murphy, Michael F G']","['Shah A', 'Diggens N', 'Stiller C', 'Murphy D', 'Passmore J', 'Murphy MF']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Richards Building, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford OX3 7LG, UK. anjali.shah@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00226-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 Sep;47(14):2175-81. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.030.

Based on the activity demonstrated in single-arm and randomized trials, this nitrogen mustard is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and rituximab-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The unique structural and mechanistic features of bendamustine differentiate it from other alkylating agents, providing increased stability and potency in DNA cross linking and subsequent cytotoxicity. Due to its unusual development, few studies have closely examined the mechanisms of action for this nitrogen mustard and many unanswered questions remain. Additionally, phase I and pharmacokinetic studies are limited, although increased understanding of the clinical pharmacology of bendamustine led to development of dosing recommendations by international experts based on the available data. The clinical activity of bendamustine as a single agent and in combination with other chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic drugs, coupled with its potential lack of cross-resistance with many other chemotherapy agents, make bendamustine an attractive therapy for patients with newly diagnosed and refractory hematologic malignancies.

Due to incomplete cross-reactivity between bendamustine and other chemotherapeutic agents, bendamustine has been extensively tested in the relapsed/refractory setting. Bendamustine is highly effective in rituximab-refractory NHL and in patients whose disease is refractory to chemotherapy, including other alkylating agents. It has also demonstrated considerable efficacy in previously untreated NHLs, both alone and in combination with rituximab or other chemotherapeutic agents. Studies suggest complete responses and durability of remission achieved with bendamustine are superior to those achieved with standard regimens. However, longer follow-up is needed to fully establish long-term response duration. Additionally, bendamustine is associated with hematologic toxicity and risk of infection, which must be carefully monitored and managed. This is particularly important in elderly patients with advanced disease. Increased understanding of the mechanisms of action of bendamustine and the efficacy of bendamustine in combination with rituximab in newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory CLL and indolent lymphomas led to investigation of other combinations. Ongoing studies are examining bendamustine with bortezomib, lenalidomide, temsirolimus, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, and other novel agents. Bendamustine is also undergoing clinical investigation in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, a patient population with limited therapeutic options currently. This review will summarize current clinical data regarding the efficacy and safety of bendamustine in patients with lymphoma and highlight ongoing clinical trials expanding the role of this alkylating agent in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Rummel, Mathias J', 'Gregory, Stephanie A']","['Rummel MJ', 'Gregory SA']","['Universitatsklinikum, Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,2011/05/06 06:00,2011/07/27 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(11)00026-6 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2011.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2011 Apr;48 Suppl 1:S24-36. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2011.03.004.,10.1053/j.seminhematol.2011.03.004 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*therapeutic use']",,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

CPX-351 and the same molar ratio of free drugs were compared for cytotoxicity against colony-forming cells (CFCs) and subpopulations of cells enriched for primitive progenitors from AML patients and normal granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML blasts (n = 13) and normal PB and BM cells (n = 7) were incubated for 24 hours in various concentrations of CPX-351 or free drugs before plating in CFC assay or staining with anti-CD34 and anti-CD38 antibodies, Annexin-V, and propidium iodide followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. High performance liquid chromatography was used to measure intracellular daunorubicin accumulation. RESULTS: AML blasts and progenitors from patients who achieved complete remission were more sensitive to both CPX-351 and free drugs than the same cells from patients with chemotherapy refractory leukemia. However, AML CFCs and CD34(+)CD38(-) AML blasts (enriched for candidate leukemia stem cells) from the same patient showed similar sensitivity to the liposomal or free drug formulations. In contrast, CFCs and CD34(+)CD38(-) cells from normal PB and BM were fivefold more sensitive to the free drugs than to CPX-351. Consistent with these observations, preferential intracellular accumulation of CPX-351 in AML over normal cells was observed, while there was little difference in drug uptake between AML and normal cells with the free drug cocktail. CONCLUSIONS: CPX-351, as compared to free cytarabine:daunorubicin, shows enhanced selective in vitro cytotoxicity for AML rather than normal progenitors.","['Kim, Hyun Pyo', 'Gerhard, Brigitte', 'Harasym, Troy O', 'Mayer, Lawrence D', 'Hogge, Donna E']","['Kim HP', 'Gerhard B', 'Harasym TO', 'Mayer LD', 'Hogge DE']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00173-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Jul;39(7):741-50. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.04.001.

Comparisons were made between two diagnosis periods (1994-1999 and 2000-2005), between four regions of residence, and between five area-based deprivation categories. Regional patterns of treatment were examined to help assess the impact of centralisation of services. There was only limited evidence of improvements in survival over time. No clear evidence was found of deprivation-related influences on childhood cancer survival in Ireland, overall or for the three main diagnostic groups examined, although a weak trend was apparent for lymphoid leukaemias. Regional variation in survival was likewise not clear-cut, with the possible exception of CNS tumours (significantly higher survival amongst patients resident in the Western region). The absence of clear trends or patterns for regional or deprivation-related variation in survival may reflect a high degree of coordination and uniformity of treatment (and perhaps diagnostic) services, and application of standard treatment protocols nationally.","['Walsh, Paul M', 'Byrne, Julianne', 'Capra, Michael', 'Comber, Harry']","['Walsh PM', 'Byrne J', 'Capra M', 'Comber H']","['National Cancer Registry, Building 6800, Cork Airport Business Park, Kinsale Road, Cork, Ireland. p.walsh@ncri.ie']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,2011/05/03 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2010/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00203-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 Aug;47(12):1852-62. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.021.

A comparison of treatment plans 2000 and 2010.,6-12,"It has been reported in several papers and textbooks that IMRT treatments increase the peripheral dose in comparison with non-IMRT fields. But in clinical practice not only open fields have been used in the pre-IMRT era, but also fields with physical wedges or composed fields. The aim of this work is to test the hypothesis of increased peripheral dose when IMRT is used compared to standard conformal radiotherapy. Furthermore, the importance of the measured dose differences in clinical practice is discussed and compared with other new technologies for the cases where an increase of the peripheral dose was observed. For cancers of the head and neck, the cervix, the rectum and for the brain irradiation due to acute leukaemia, one to four plans have been calculated with IMRT or conformal standard technique (non-IMRT). In an anthropomorphic phantom the dose at a distance of 30cm in cranio-caudal direction from the target edge was measured with TLDs using a linear accelerator Oncor ((R)) (Siemens) for both techniques. IMRT was performed using step-and-shoot technique (7 to 11 beams), non-IMRT plans with different techniques. The results depended on the site of irradiation. For head and neck cancers IMRT resulted in an increase of 0.05 - 0.09% of the prescribed total dose (Dptv) or 40 - 70 mGy (Dptv=65Gy), compared to non-IMRT technique without wedges or a decrease of 0.16% (approx. 100 mGy) of the prescribed total dose compared to non-IMRT techniques with wedges. For the cervical cancer IMRT resulted in an increased dose in the periphery (+ 0.07% - 0.15% of Dptv or 30 - 70 mGy at Dptv=45Gy), for the rectal cancer in a dose reduction (0.21 - 0.26% of Dptv or 100 - 130 mGy at Dptv=50Gy) and for the brain irradiation in an increase dose (+ 0.05% of Dptv=18Gy or 9 mSv). In summary IMRT does not uniformly cause increased radiation dose in the periphery in the model used. It can be stated that these dose values are smaller than reported in earlier papers. Slightly increased additional radiation dose in the periphery is likely to be counterbalanced by the much higher conformity and the often better homogeneity.","['Salz, Henning', 'Eichner, Regina', 'Wiezorek, Tilo']","['Salz H', 'Eichner R', 'Wiezorek T']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Jena. henning.salz@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Med Phys,Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik,100886455,2011/05/03 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2010/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0939-3889(11)00032-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.zemedi.2011.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Z Med Phys. 2012 Feb;22(1):6-12. doi: 10.1016/j.zemedi.2011.03.004.

METHODS: In the present study we investigated the prognostic significance of CD13 and CD33 myeloid antigens (MY) aberrantly expressed on the blasts of ALL patients and Bcl-2 anti- apoptotic molecule expression in childhood ALL. RESULTS: Aberrant expression of MY occurred in 8.8% of cases. Variant levels of Bcl-2 were expressed in patients (44.2+/-25.5%), with more than 20% positivity for Bcl-2 in 64.7% of patients. Bcl-2+ patients survived 959+/-242 days compared to 1059+230 days for Bcl-2- patients (P=0.2). Corresponding data for complete remission duration was 682+/-170 and 716+/-173 days (P=0.3), respectively, indicating no significant association between survival and complete remission duration of patients with expression of the Bcl-2 molecule. Analysis of clinical response according to MY expression, however, showed significant association with survival and complete remission duration. MY+ patients had shorter complete remission duration (383+/-58 days) and survival (473+/-68 days) than MY- patients (complete remission duration, 724+/-144 days; survival, 1045+/-186 days; P<0.001). Expression of Bcl-2 along with MY was not associated with a significant decrease in survival or complete remission duration. CONCLUSION: Results of this study indicated that expression of MY was a poor prognostic factor in childhood ALL.

Relapsed cases of promyelocytic leukemia can be salvaged with arsenic trioxide. METHODS: Between May 1999 and Jan. 2010, we treated 31 relapsed cases of promyelocytic leukemia with arsenic trioxide. These cases relapsed after previous treatment with ATRA and chemotherapy. We applied arsenic trioxide as 0.15 mg/kg iv infusion until complete remission. After achieving complete remission patients received 2-4 consolidation therapy in the same schedule as remission induction. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 27 years. Complete remission rate was 77.4%. We observed four mortalities during remission induction. With a median follow up of 32 months, ten more relapses occurred. Two year disease-free survival and overall survival for the entire cohort was 54.6% and 81.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our result is the same as other studies. Thus, we suggest that arsenic trioxide can be used as salvage therapy in patients who relapsed. Despite a good complete remission rate, the relapse rate during the first two years of treatment is high and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered after achieving complete remission.","['Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Jahani, Mohamad', 'Mousavi, Asadolah', 'Iravani, Masoud', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Ghaffari, Hamidolah', 'Hosseini, Roholah', 'Jalili, Mehdi']","['Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Jahani M', 'Mousavi A', 'Iravani M', 'Rostami S', 'Ghaffari H', 'Hosseini R', 'Jalili M']","['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. alimgh@ams.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Clinical Study', 'Journal Article']",Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,2011/05/03 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2011/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['004 [pii]', '011143/AIM.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2011 May;14(3):167-9. doi: 011143/AIM.004.,011143/AIM.004 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The US FDA approved it for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic, accelerated, or blastic phase with resistance or intolerance to imatinib therapy. Dasatinib is also indicated for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have become resistant to or intolerant of other treatments. The agent is now also approved for newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP) patients. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dasatinib as well as clinical data limited to CP-CML patients. Four-year follow-up of a phase III dose-optimization trial confirmed that better progression-free survival (66%) and overall survival (82%) were obtained with a dose of 100 mg once daily (od) than with the standard 70 mg twice daily dosing (65% and 75%, respectively).

Information on the potential role of lectin-pathway components in carcinogenesis versus immune surveillance of cancer is scarce. This study aimed to determine if serum concentrations of MBL and MASP-2 differ between children with cancer and healthy age-matched controls. METHODS: In this retrospective multicentre study, MBL and MASP-2 were measured by commercially available ELISA in frozen remnants of serum taken at diagnosis in paediatric patients with cancer. For six diagnostic groups, these concentrations were compared with serum concentrations of age-matched healthy controls using exact Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: MBL and MASP-2 were measured in serum of 372 patients. MBL was significantly higher in patients with solid tumours vs. controls (median, 2,799 vs. 1,917 mug/L; P = 0.008), and MASP-2 was significantly higher in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (406 vs. 317 mug/L; P = 0.009), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (361 vs. 293 mug/L; P = 0.037) and CNS tumors (463 vs. 296 mug/L; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results may indicate a role of MBL and MASP-2 in the initiation or progression of specific paediatric cancers, while other mechanisms remain possible as well. Larger, disease-specific studies are warranted for confirmation and for elucidation of the underlying mechanisms.","['Fisch, Urs P', 'Zehnder, Aina', 'Hirt, Andreas', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Simon, A', 'Ozsahin, Hulya', 'Schlapbach, Luregn J', 'Ammann, Roland A']","['Fisch U', 'Zehnder A', 'Hirt A', 'Niggli F', 'Simon A', 'Ozsahin H', 'Schlapbach L', 'Ammann R']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,2011/04/30 06:00,2011/07/30 06:00,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['smw-13191 [pii]', '10.4414/smw.2011.13191 [doi]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2011 Apr 29;141:w13191. doi: 10.4414/smw.2011.13191. eCollection 2011.,10.4414/smw.2011.13191 [doi] 2011;141:w13191 [pii],20110429,"['0 (Mannose-Binding Lectin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases)']",IM,"['Child', 'Complement Pathway, Mannose-Binding Lectin', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/*blood', 'Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases/*analysis', 'Medical Audit', '*Neoplasms/classification', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Switzerland']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of apoptotic Genes was examined at the protein level by flow cytometry and at the mRNA level by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Both vincristine and anti-Fas monoclonal antibody induced apoptosis in HL60 cells but failed to do so in both MDR cell lines.

In order to make progress in terms of curing these devastating diseases, we must understand leukemia biology on the clinical, cellular and molecular levels, with exploitation of the leukemia-associated molecular targets in designing strategies aimed at eradicating the leukemic clone. In this review, we will discuss a few key mechanisms of leukemogenesis that represent convergent pathways of malignant transformation and, as such, present pivotal molecular targets for therapy. Specifically, we focus on normal and leukemic hematopoietic cell cycle regulation, issues surrounding DNA damage and repair, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and drug responsiveness, and multidrug resistance as a marker for stem cell involvement and as a novel target for intervention. When functioning normally, such mechanisms determine a cell's ability to respond to DNA damage, traverse the cell cycle and maintain genomic integrity. And in addition to the target cell itself, there are crucial extracellular determinants of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation that modulate net signalling activity and gene expression, cell-cell contact and growth-modulating factors for instance. The molecular dissection of these intersecting pathways, from the extracellular milieu to the genes themselves, in both the normal and transformed states will elucidate the means by which cells escape treatment-induced death. Such understanding should, in turn, lead to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies that exploit differences between normal and malignant cells, overcome the mechanisms by which leukemic cells acquire drug resistance, and enhance the curability of these devastating diseases.","['Karp, J']",['Karp J'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1997/10/01 00:00,1997/10/01 00:01,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1997 Oct;11(4):657-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR-ABL fusion protein exhibits a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity capable of phosphorylating different cellular substrates in vivo and in vitro. SHP-1 (SHPTP1, PTP1C, HCP, SHP) is an SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells. The association of the murine motheaten phenotype of severe hematopoietic dysregulation with loss of SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity indicates a critical role of SHP-1 in the regulation of hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation. Experiments were performed to determine whether SHP-1 might form specific complexes with BCR-ABL signaling pathway. We found that SHP-1 was highly and constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in 32DCl3 and TF-1 cells transfected with BCR-ABL expression vector. Furthermore, SHP-1 and BCR-ABL formed stable complexes in BCR-ABL expressing cells. Direct binding between SHP-1 and Grb2 was observed in vitro. Expression of BCR-ABL in TF-1 cells resulted in a two-fold increase in SHP-1 phosphatase activity. BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase was able to phosphorylate recombinant SHP-1 protein in vitro. SHP-1 therefore has the capacity to bind and potentially modulate the signaling effectors involved in activation of Ras, and accordingly, regulation of cellular transformation of BCR-ABL.","['Tauchi, T', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Yamashita, Y', 'Sugimoto, S', 'Toyama, K']","['Tauchi T', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Yamashita Y', 'Sugimoto S', 'Toyama K']","['KYOWA HAKKO KOGYO CO LTD,TOKYO RES LABS,TOKYO 194,JAPAN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.11.3.471 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1997 Sep;11(3):471-5. doi: 10.3892/ijo.11.3.471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the APL model offers a unique opportunity to study the cyto-differentiating action of ATRA and synthetic retinoids in a clinically relevant setting. This review article summarizes the work relating to the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of retinoic acid and retinoids in APL cells, and focuses on: a) genes which are expressed and regulated by ATRA; b) synthetic retinoids as cyto-differentiating agents; c) rational combinations between retinoids and cytokines or other cyto-differentiating agents; d) cellular paradigms of retinoic acid resistance.

However, there is a dearth of information about health status and associated health-related quality of life (HRQL) in children and adults with cancer, during the treatment process; a deficit which this study was intended to redress. All children (n=18) receiving 'maintenance' chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at a single institution were assessed prospectively through a single cycle of therapy. Patients, family members and health care professionals used global ratings, the health utilities index mark 2 (HUI2) and mark 3 (HUI3) classification systems, and detailed descriptions of temporary states of health, to provide independent assessments of health status at weekly intervals. Utility scores were derived for each comprehensive health state and for single attribute levels of the HUI2 system, and for the temporary health state descriptions. The classification of the subjects into the most appropriate temporary health states was challenging even for older children and some of the parents. The HUI instruments were used much more easily and produced highly comparable information. The most frequently affected attributes were pain, emotion and mobility/ambulation; in that order. The global (p=0.005) and specific morbidity burdens were, as predicted, greatest in the middle of the cycle of chemotherapy, reflecting the toxicity of steroid use. HUI2 global utility scores demonstrated moderate responsiveness with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.43. Cyclical administration of therapy, in particular corticosteroids, produces important changes in health status and HRQL in children with ALL. The HUI are valid and responsive systems for quantifying the burden of morbidity during the treatment of cancer in childhood. These are sensitive tools which can be used in a wide array of other circumstances to quantify changes in health status.","['Barr, R', 'Petrie, C', 'Furlong, W', 'Rothney, M', 'Feeny, D']","['Barr R', 'Petrie C', 'Furlong W', 'Rothney M', 'Feeny D']","['MCMASTER UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT CLIN EPIDEMIOL & BIOSTAT,HAMILTON,ON L8N 3Z5,CANADA.

High dose therapy followed by stem cell transplantation seems to be one of the most effective treatment modalities for CML. However, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a curative treatment modality, is limited due to the availability of matched siblings. On the other hand, the autologous stem cell harvests are contaminated with leukemic cells, and therefore a significant reduction of leukemic cells is desired before using the harvest for transplantation. Therefore in the present study, effects of a combination of a suboptimal concentration of 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC) and an optimal concentration of c-myb antisense oligonucleotide on the growth of K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemic cells in vitro were determined. The combination significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the growth of K562 cells in vitro when compared to the effects of c-myb oligonucleotide or 4HC alone. The c-myb oligonucleotide alone or in combination with low dose 4HC decreased the expression of c-myb gene as determined by RT-PCR techniques. Cellular uptake and retention of fluoresceinated oligonucleotide in control and treated K562 cells was studied using plain field laser microscopy and flow cytometry. There was an increase in cellular uptake of c-myb oligonucleotide in K562 cells as measured by plain field laser microscopy in the presence of 4HC. The combination of oligonucleotides and 4HC did not significantly decrease the number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from normal hematopoietic stem cell harvests as determined by in vitro colony assays. The combination of low dose 4HC and c-myb antisense oligonucleotides can potentially be applied in CML patients, particularly for purging leukemic cells present in their hematopoietic stem cell harvests.","['Rao, A', 'Kuszynski, C', 'Benner, E', 'Iversen, P', 'Jackson, J', 'Bishop, M', 'Joshi, S']","['Rao A', 'Kuszynski C', 'Benner E', 'Iversen P', 'Jackson J', 'Bishop M', 'Joshi S']","['UNIV NEBRASKA,MED CTR,DEPT CELL BIOL & ANAT,OMAHA,NE 68198.

In the present study, we found that the decrease in telomerase activity did not temporally correlate with the expression of a differentiation marker, CD11b, on the cell surface. Mixing of protein extracts from telomerase-negative differentiated HL60 cells with those from parental HL60 cells did not result in inhibition of telomerase activity, suggesting that a diffusible cellular telomerase inhibitor was not produced in the differentiated cells.

The protein has been noted for its expression in specific neuronal subtypes in the support of hierarchical organizing principles in the mammalian brain. Secretagogin has previously been found to interact with SNAP25 involved in Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis. Here, the cellular interaction network of secretagogin has been expanded with nine proteins: SNAP-23, DOC2alpha, ARFGAP2, rootletin, KIF5B, beta-tubulin, DDAH-2, ATP-synthase and myeloid leukemia factor 2, based on screening of a high content protein array and validation and quantification of binding with surface plasmon resonance and GST pulldown assays. All targets have association rate constants in the range 10(4)-10(6) M(-1) s(-1), dissociation rate constants in the range 10(-3)-10(-5) s(-1) and equilibrium dissociation constants in the 100 pM to 10 nM range. The novel target SNAP23 is an essential component of the high affinity receptor for the general membrane fusion machinery and an important regulator of transport vesicle docking and fusion. Complementary roles in vesicle trafficking are known for ARFGAP2 and DOC2alpha in regulating fusion of vesicles to membranes, kinesin 5B and tubulin for transport of vesicles in the cell, while rootletin builds up the rootlet believed to function as a scaffold for vesicles. The identification of a discrete network of interacting proteins that mediate secretion and vesicle trafficking suggests a regulatory role for secretagogin in these processes.","['Bauer, Mikael C', ""O'Connell, David J"", 'Maj, Magdalena', 'Wagner, Ludwig', 'Cahill, Dolores J', 'Linse, Sara']","['Bauer MC', ""O'Connell DJ"", 'Maj M', 'Wagner L', 'Cahill DJ', 'Linse S']","['Departments of Biophysical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Lund University, Chemical Centre, P.O.

Although the majority of patients initially respond to upfront chemotherapy, relapses with poor prognosis occur in approximately 20% of cases.

B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL cells express low levels of immunogenic molecules and, therefore, are poorly recognized by the immune system. In the present study, we investigated the effect of various combinations of potent B-cell stimulators including CpG, Interleukin (IL)-2 family cytokines and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on the immunogenicity of primary BCP-ALL cells and a series of BCP-ALL cell lines. The combination of CpG, IL-4 and CD40L was identified as most effective to enhance expression of immunogenic molecules on BCP-ALL cells, resulting in an increased capacity to induce both allogeneic and autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Importantly, such CTL exhibited significant anti-leukemic cytotoxicity not only towards treated, but also towards untreated BCP-ALL cells. Our results demonstrate that the combination of CpG with other B-cell stimulators is more efficient than CpG alone in generating immunogenic BCP-ALL cells and anti-leukemic CTL.

Although one of their major targets in LSCs is known to be the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor gene locus, the role of PcG proteins in the leukemic reprogramming of target cells into LSCs is not well characterized. In this study, Bmi1(-/-) granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) were transformed with the leukemic fusion gene MLL-AF9. Although Bmi1 was not essential to the immortalization of GMPs in vitro, Bmi1(-/-) cells showed enhanced differentiation and retained less LSCs. A number of genes were derepressed in the absence of Bmi1 including potential tumor suppressor genes. Transplantation assays demonstrated that Bmi1 was indispensable for the development of leukemia in vivo and deletion of both the Ink4a and Arf genes only partially restored the leukemogenic capacity of Bmi1(-/-) LSCs. Of note, the complementation of immortalized Bmi1(-/-)Ink4a-Arf(-/-) GMPs with Bmi1 failed to restore the expression of the majority of deregulated genes and leukemogenic activity in vivo. These findings indicate that Bmi1 is essential for the faithful reprogramming of myeloid progenitors into LSCs and unveil that leukemic fusion genes require PcG proteins exerting an effect in concert to establish LSC-specific transcriptional profiles, which confer full leukemogenic activity on LSCs.","['Yuan, J', 'Takeuchi, M', 'Negishi, M', 'Oguro, H', 'Ichikawa, H', 'Iwama, A']","['Yuan J', 'Takeuchi M', 'Negishi M', 'Oguro H', 'Ichikawa H', 'Iwama A']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/30 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201185 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.85 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1335-43. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.85.

Over the past decades, the heterogeneity of AML has been illustrated by evolving classifications based on morphology (French-American-British classification (FAB classification), cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. t(8&semi;21), monosomies etc.), phenotype and/or molecular abnormalities (e.g. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), mutations in nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and the transcription factor CCAAT /enhancer binding protein a (CEBPA), etc.). The current World Health Organisation (WHO) 2008 classification has integrated these classification modalities. Clinically, dissection of AML into various subtypes allows better survival prediction, but has still limited impact on treatment strategies, with the exception of all-trans retinoic acid treatment for AML-M3 and no allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation in complete remission (CR1) for patients with normal karyotype bearing an NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD. However, enhanced understanding of the molecular biology of AML will likely result in more 'tailor-made' therapies, for example by adding specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors to standard chemotherapy. In this review, we summarise the variables currently used to classify AML. Specifically, the contribution of microarrays in classification, prognosis and understanding of pathobiology of AML is discussed.","['de Jonge, H J M', 'Huls, G', 'de Bont, E S J M']","['de Jonge HJ', 'Huls G', 'de Bont ES']","[""Division of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Department of Paediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, the Netherlands. h.j.m.de.jonge@int.umcg.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Neth J Med,The Netherlands journal of medicine,0356133,2011/04/30 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Neth J Med. 2011 Apr;69(4):167-76.,,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'World Health Organization']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mammals contain seven H3K4 HMTs, Set1A, Set1B, and MLL1-MLL5. The activity of SET1 and MLL proteins relies on protein-protein interactions within large multisubunit complexes that include three core components: RbBP5, Ash2L, and WDR5. It remains unclear how the composition and specificity of these complexes varies between cell types and during development. Caenorhabditis elegans contains one SET1 protein, SET-2, one MLL-like protein, SET-16, and single homologs of RbBP5, Ash2L, and WDR5. Here we show that SET-2 is responsible for the majority of bulk H3K4 methylation at all developmental stages. However, SET-2 and absent, small, or homeotic discs 2 (ASH-2) are differentially required for tri- and dimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3 and -me2) in embryos and adult germ cells. In embryos, whereas efficient H3K4me3 requires both SET-2 and ASH-2, H3K4me2 relies mostly on ASH-2. In adult germ cells by contrast, SET-2 serves a major role whereas ASH-2 is dispensable for H3K4me3 and most H3K4me2. Loss of SET-2 results in progressive sterility over several generations, suggesting an important function in the maintenance of a functional germ line. This study demonstrates that individual subunits of SET1-related complexes can show tissue specificity and developmental regulation and establishes C. elegans as a model to study SET1-related complexes in a multicellular organism.","['Xiao, Yu', 'Bedet, Cecile', 'Robert, Valerie J P', 'Simonet, Thomas', 'Dunkelbarger, Steve', 'Rakotomalala, Cedric', 'Soete, Gwen', 'Korswagen, Hendrik C', 'Strome, Susan', 'Palladino, Francesca']","['Xiao Y', 'Bedet C', 'Robert VJ', 'Simonet T', 'Dunkelbarger S', 'Rakotomalala C', 'Soete G', 'Korswagen HC', 'Strome S', 'Palladino F']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, UMR5239 CNRS, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69007 Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2011/04/30 06:00,2011/07/27 06:00,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1019290108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1019290108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 May 17;108(20):8305-10. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1019290108.

We hypothesized that LIF is a contraction-induced myokine functioning in an autocrine fashion to activate gene regulation of human muscle satellite cell proliferation. Skeletal muscle LIF expression, regulation, and action were examined in two models: 1) young men performing a bout of heavy resistance exercise of the quadriceps muscle and 2) cultured primary human satellite cells. Resistance exercise induced a ninefold increase in LIF mRNA content in skeletal muscle, but LIF was not detectable in plasma of the subjects. However, electrically stimulated cultured human myotubes produced and secreted LIF, suggesting that LIF is a myokine with local effects. The well established exercise-induced signaling molecules PI3K, Akt, and mTor contributed to the regulation of LIF in cultured human myotubes as chemical inhibition of PI3K and mTor and siRNA knockdown of Akt1 were independently sufficient to downregulate LIF. Human myoblast proliferation was increased by recombinant exogenous LIF and decreased by siRNA knockdown of the endogenous LIF receptor. Finally, the transcription factors JunB and c-Myc, which promote myoblast proliferation, were induced by LIF in cultured human myotubes. Indeed, both JunB and c-Myc were also increased in skeletal muscle following resistance exercise. Our data suggest that LIF is a contraction-induced myokine, potentially acting in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to promote satellite cell proliferation.","['Broholm, Christa', 'Laye, Matthew J', 'Brandt, Claus', 'Vadalasetty, Radhika', 'Pilegaard, Henriette', 'Pedersen, Bente Klarlund', 'Scheele, Camilla']","['Broholm C', 'Laye MJ', 'Brandt C', 'Vadalasetty R', 'Pilegaard H', 'Pedersen BK', 'Scheele C']","['Rigshospitalet, Centre of Inflammation and Metabolism (CIM) 7641, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. christa.broholm@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",8502536,2011/04/30 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['japplphysiol.01399.2010 [pii]', '10.1152/japplphysiol.01399.2010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Appl Physiol (1985). 2011 Jul;111(1):251-9. doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.01399.2010.

NADPH is a major reducing compound in cells that is essential for detoxification and may be involved in resistance of glioblastoma to treatment. IDH has never been considered important in NADPH production. Therefore, the authors investigated NADPH-producing dehydrogenases using in silico analysis of human cancer gene expression microarray data sets and metabolic mapping of human and rodent tissues to determine the role of IDH in total NADPH production. Expression of most NADPH-producing dehydrogenase genes was not elevated in 34 cancer data sets except for IDH1 in glioma and thyroid cancer, indicating an association with the IDH1 mutation. IDH activity was the main provider of NADPH in human normal brain and glioblastoma, but its role was modest in NADPH production in rodent brain and other tissues.

For improved diagnosis and risk stratification, the initiating genetic events need to be elucidated. To investigate the genetic basis of BCP-ALL, genomes of 94 iAMP21 patients were interrogated by arrays, FISH, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Most copy number alterations targeted chromosome 21, reinforcing the complexity of this chromosome. The common region of amplification on chromosome 21 was refined to a 5.1-mb region that included RUNX1, miR-802, and genes mapping to the Down syndrome critical region. Recurrent abnormalities affecting genes in key pathways were identified: IKZF1 (22%), CDKN2A/B (17%), PAX5 (8%), ETV6 (19%), and RB1 (37%).

However, MYC is a complex oncogene, involving both fine protein dosage and cell-context dependency, and detailed understanding of MYC-mediated oncogenesis in T-ALL is still lacking. To better understand how MYC is interspersed in the complex T-ALL oncogenic networks, we performed a thorough molecular and biochemical analysis of MYC activation in a comprehensive collection of primary adult and pediatric patient samples. We find that MYC expression is highly variable, and that high MYC expression levels can be generated in a large number of cases in absence of NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations, suggesting the occurrence of multiple activation pathways in addition to NOTCH1. Furthermore, we show that posttranscriptional deregulation of MYC constitutes a major alternative pathway of MYC activation in T-ALL, operating partly via the PI3K/AKT axis through down-regulation of PTEN, and that NOTCH1(m) might play a dual transcriptional and posttranscriptional role in this process. Altogether, our data lend further support to the significance of therapeutic targeting of MYC and/or the PTEN/AKT pathways, both in GSI-resistant and identified NOTCH1-independent/MYC-mediated T-ALL patients.","['Bonnet, Melanie', 'Loosveld, Marie', 'Montpellier, Bertrand', 'Navarro, Jean-Marc', 'Quilichini, Benoit', 'Picard, Christophe', 'Di Cristofaro, Julie', 'Bagnis, Claude', 'Fossat, Chantal', 'Hernandez, Lucie', 'Mamessier, Emilie', 'Roulland, Sandrine', 'Morgado, Ester', 'Formisano-Treziny, Christine', 'Dik, Willem A', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Gabert, Jean', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth A', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Payet-Bornet, Dominique', 'Nadel, Bertrand']","['Bonnet M', 'Loosveld M', 'Montpellier B', 'Navarro JM', 'Quilichini B', 'Picard C', 'Di Cristofaro J', 'Bagnis C', 'Fossat C', 'Hernandez L', 'Mamessier E', 'Roulland S', 'Morgado E', 'Formisano-Treziny C', 'Dik WA', 'Langerak AW', 'Prebet T', 'Vey N', 'Michel G', 'Gabert J', 'Soulier J', 'Macintyre EA', 'Asnafi V', 'Payet-Bornet D', 'Nadel B']","['Center of Immunology of Marseille-Luminy, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille cedex 9, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/30 06:00,2011/09/03 06:00,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44927-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-336842 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 16;117(24):6650-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-336842.

We show herein that increased SK-1/S1P enhances Bcr-Abl1 protein stability, through inhibition of its proteasomal degradation in imatinib-resistant K562/IMA-3 and LAMA-4/IMA human CML cells. In fact, Bcr-Abl1 stability was enhanced by ectopic SK-1 expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated SK-1 knockdown in K562/IMA-3 cells, or its genetic loss in SK-1(-/-) MEFs, significantly reduced Bcr-Abl1 stability. Regulation of Bcr-Abl1 by SK-1/S1P was dependent on S1P receptor 2 (S1P2) signaling, which prevented Bcr-Abl1 dephosphorylation, and degradation via inhibition of PP2A. Molecular or pharmacologic interference with SK-1/S1P2 restored PP2A-dependent Bcr-Abl1 dephosphorylation, and enhanced imatinib- or nilotinib-induced growth inhibition in primary CD34(+) mononuclear cells obtained from chronic phase and blast crisis CML patients, K562/IMA-3 or LAMA4/IMA cells, and 32Dcl3 murine progenitor cells, expressing the wild-type or mutant (Y253H or T315I) Bcr-Abl1 in situ. Accordingly, impaired SK-1/S1P2 signaling enhanced the growth-inhibitory effects of nilotinib against 32D/T315I-Bcr-Abl1-derived mouse allografts. Since SK-1/S1P/S1P2 signaling regulates Bcr-Abl1 stability via modulation of PP2A, inhibition of SK-1/S1P2 axis represents a novel approach to target wild-type- or mutant-Bcr-Abl1 thereby overcoming drug resistance.","['Salas, Arelis', 'Ponnusamy, Suriyan', 'Senkal, Can E', 'Meyers-Needham, Marisa', 'Selvam, Shanmugam Panneer', 'Saddoughi, Sahar A', 'Apohan, Elif', 'Sentelle, R David', 'Smith, Charles', 'Gault, Christopher R', 'Obeid, Lina M', 'El-Shewy, Hesham M', 'Oaks, Joshua', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Baran, Yusuf', 'Mahajan, Sandeep', 'Fernandes, Daniel', 'Stuart, Robert', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Ogretmen, Besim']","['Salas A', 'Ponnusamy S', 'Senkal CE', 'Meyers-Needham M', 'Selvam SP', 'Saddoughi SA', 'Apohan E', 'Sentelle RD', 'Smith C', 'Gault CR', 'Obeid LM', 'El-Shewy HM', 'Oaks J', 'Santhanam R', 'Marcucci G', 'Baran Y', 'Mahajan S', 'Fernandes D', 'Stuart R', 'Perrotti D', 'Ogretmen B']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/30 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2011/04/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45008-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-300772 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 2;117(22):5941-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-300772.

We found that p90RSK2 is commonly activated in diverse leukemia cell lines expressing different leukemogenic tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). Interestingly, in a murine BM transplantation (BMT) model, genetic deficiency of RSK2 did not affect the pathogenesis or disease progression of BCR-ABL-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (PN). In contrast, FLT3-ITD induced a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in BMT mice receiving RSK2 knockout (KO) BM cells, phenotypically distinct from the myeloproliferative neoplasm induced by FLT3-ITD using wild-type BM cells. In consonance with these results, inhibition of RSK2 by an RSK inhibitor, fmk, did not effectively induce apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing murine Ba/F3 cells, human K562 cells or primary tissue samples from CML patients, whereas fmk treatment induced significant apoptotic cell death not only in FLT3-ITD-positive Ba/F3 cells, human Molm14 and Mv(4;11) leukemia cells, but also in primary tissue samples from AML patients. These results suggest that RSK2 is dispensable for BCR-ABL-induced myeloid leukemia, but may be required for pathogenesis and lineage determination in FLT3-ITD-induced hematopoietic transformation.

The immunophenotypic profile of plasma cells was determined with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The antigen expression intensity was calculated as relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). Bone marrow plasma cells showed expression of particular antigens in the following proportion of cases: CD49d 100%, CD29 94%, CD54 93%, CD44 83%, CD56 60%, CD18 26%, CD11b 29%, CD11a 19%, CD117 27%, CD71 30%, CD126 100% and CD19 0%, while the expression of those antigens on peripheral blood plasma cells was present in the following percentage of patients: CD49d 100%, CD29 96%, CD54 93%, CD44 95%, CD56 56%, CD18 50%, CD11b 53%, CD11a 29%, CD117 26%, CD71 28%, CD126 100% and CD19 0%. The expression of CD54 was significantly higher than that of adhesion molecules belonging to the integrin b2 family: CD11a, CD18 and CD11b, on both bone marrow and peripheral blood cells (p < 0.01). Expression of CD18, CD11a and CD11b was differential between two cell compartments: lower on bone marrow and higher on peripheral blood cells. We found that plasma cells in the bone marrow of patients with plasma cell leukaemia showed significantly greater granularity and size than those in the peripheral blood (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.04, respectively). However, no differences in cell size or granularity were revealed between bone marrow plasma cells from patients with PCL and multiple myeloma. In conclusion, impaired expression of adhesion molecules such as CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) or CD56 may explain hematogenic dissemination characterizing PCL. The following pattern of adhesion molecule expression according to the proportion of plasma cells expressing a given antigen in peripheral blood and bone marrow and arranged in diminishing order may be established: CD49d > CD44 > CD54 > CD29 > CD56 > CD18 > CD11b > CD11a. Immuno-phenotyping of plasma cells in PCL, as in multiple myeloma, might be useful in detecting minimal residual disease in cases with aberrant antigen expression and for selecting therapeutic agents towards specific membrane targets.","['Kraj, Maria', 'Kopec-Szlezak, Joanna', 'Poglod, Ryszard', 'Kruk, Barbara']","['Kraj M', 'Kopec-Szlezak J', 'Poglod R', 'Kruk B']","['Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland. mkraj@ihit.waw.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5603/fhc.2011.0024 [doi]'],ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2011;49(1):168-82. doi: 10.5603/fhc.2011.0024.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the immunophenotype of DC generated from monocytes (Mo-DC) of patients with CML and the influence of TKI therapy on the results of CML-DC generation. We also measured the percentages of T regulatory cells (Tregs) as well as Th17 cells in 19 untreated patients suffering from CML, and in 28 CML patients treated with TKI. We found that DC can be reliably generated from the peripheral blood CD14+ cells of untreated CML patients. But we observed a persistent expression of CD14 monocyte marker on DC from CML patients, together with lower percentages of Mo-DC with expression of CD1a (p = 0.002), CD80 (p = 0.0005), CD83 (p = 0.0004), and CD209 (p = 0.02) compared to healthy donors. There was an adverse correlation between WBC count and the percentage of Mo-DC with co-expression of CD80 and CD86 (R = -0.63; p = 0.03). In patients treated with TKI, we observed higher efficacy of DC generation in seven-day cultures, compared to untreated patients. Expression of CD209 on DC was higher in patients treated with TKI (0.02). The duration of TKI therapy correlated adversely with MFI for CD1a (R = -0.49; p = 0.006) and positively with MFI for CD83 (R = 0.63; p = 0.01). Percentages of CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ cells (p = 0.0002) and Th17 cells (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in untreated CML patients compared to healthy controls. There was a significant correlation between the percentage of Treg cells and the percentage of peripheral blood basophiles (R = 0.821; p = 0.02). There were no changes in Tregs or Th17 cell percentages in CML patients after six months of TKI therapy. However, the expression of intracellular IL-17 in Th17 cells correlated negatively with the time of TKI therapy in the whole group of treated patients (R = -0.516; p = 0.04). We noted a correlation between IL-6 serum level and peripheral blood WBC count (R = 0.492; p = 0.04). There was also an inverse correlation between the serum level of IL-6 and the duration of TKI therapy (R = -0.66; p = 0.03). Taken together, our data shows that mature DC can be generated from CML patients treated with TKI, and that the yield of Mo-DC is higher in patients treated with TKI than in patients with active disease. This should encourage further trials with DC immunotherapy in patients with cytogenetic response after TKI therapy. We also found increased frequencies of T regulatory and Th17 cells in CML patients, which might suggest their potential role in immunity against this disease. Further studies are needed to determine if manipulation of these cell populations might improve the results of DC immunotherapy.","['Hus, Iwona', 'Tabarkiewicz, Jacek', 'Lewandowska, Magdalena', 'Wasiak, Magdalena', 'Wdowiak, Paulina', 'Kusz, Maria', 'Legiec, Monika', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Rolinski, Jacek']","['Hus I', 'Tabarkiewicz J', 'Lewandowska M', 'Wasiak M', 'Wdowiak P', 'Kusz M', 'Legiec M', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Rolinski J']","['Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland. iwonach.hus@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5603/fhc.2011.0022 [doi]'],ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2011;49(1):153-60. doi: 10.5603/fhc.2011.0022.,,,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main mechanism of an anti-tumor response depends on T-cell activation. Unlike the constitutively expressed CD28, inducible costimulatory molecule (ICOS) is expressed on the T-cell surface after activation. ICOS enhances all the basic T-cell responses to a foreign antigen, namely proliferation, secretion of lymphokines, the upregulation of molecules that mediate cell-cell interaction, and effective help for antibody secretion by B cells. ICOS is essential for both efficient interaction between T and B cells and normal antibody responses to T cell-dependent antigens. It does not upregulate the production of interleukin-2, but superinduces the synthesis of interleukin-10. Our previous results indicated the ICOS gene has a role as a susceptibility locus to B-CLL. Therefore an extended study was undertaken to evaluate the association between four ICOS polymorphisms (which were recently described as functional ones) and susceptibility to B-CLL in the Polish population. A case-control study of 296 individuals, including 146 B-CLL patients, was conducted on four polymorphisms in the ICOS gene. Genotyping of the polymorphisms ICOS ISV1+173T>C (rs10932029), ICOSc.1624C>T (rs10932037), ICOSc.2373G>C (rs4675379), and ICOSc.602A>C (rs10183087) was carried out using allelic discrimination methods with the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. There were no statistically significant differences in the allele, genotype, or haplotype distributions between B-CLL patients and healthy controls for any of the investigated polymorphic markers in the ICOS gene. However, we noted that patients carrying genotype ICOS ISV1+173T>C [TT], ICOSc.602A>C [AA], ICOSc.1624C>T [CC], and ICOSc.2373G>C [GG] have a decreased frequency of progression to a higher Rai stage during 60-month follow-up (21.35% vs. 40.8%, p = 0.013) compared to other individuals. This indicates that the investigated polymorphisms do not modulate the risk of B-CLL in the Polish population, but are associated with disease dynamics, in particular with the time to Rai stage progression.","['Karabon, Lidia', 'Jedynak, Anna', 'Tomkiewicz, Anna', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Kielbinski, Marek', 'Woszczyk, Dariusz', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Frydecka, Irena']","['Karabon L', 'Jedynak A', 'Tomkiewicz A', 'Wolowiec D', 'Kielbinski M', 'Woszczyk D', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Frydecka I']","['Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Science, Wroclaw, Poland. lkarabon@iitd.pan.wroc.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5603/fhc.2011.0008 [doi]'],ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2011;49(1):49-54. doi: 10.5603/fhc.2011.0008.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (ICOS protein, human)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Poland', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While significant advances in treatment have been made, with the 5-year survival rate for medulloblastoma at 70-80%, treating patients under 3 years of age still poses a problem due to the deleterious effects of radiation on the developing brain, and the median survival for patients with glioblastoma is only 15 months. The transcription factor, STAT3, has been found constitutively activated in a wide variety of cancers and in recent years it has become an attractive therapeutic target. We designed a non-peptide small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, LLL12, using structure-based design. LLL12 was able to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation, decrease cell viability and induce apoptosis in medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines with elevated levels of p-STAT3 (Y705). IC(50) values for LLL12 were found to be between 1.07 microM and 5.98 microM in the five cell lines expressing phosphorylated STAT3. STAT3 target genes were found to be downregulated and a decrease in STAT3 DNA binding was observed following LLL12 treatment, indicating that LLL12 is an effective STAT3 inhibitor. LLL12 was also able to inhibit colony formation, wound healing and decreased IL-6 and LIF secretion.

In this study, we report that SALL4 expression was higher in drug resistant primary acute myeloid leukemic patients than those from drug-responsive cases. In addition, while overexpression of SALL4 led to drug resistance in cell lines, cells with decreased SALL4 expression were more sensitive to drug treatments than the parental cells. This led to our investigation of the implication of SALL4 in drug resistance and its role in side population (SP) cancer stem cells. SALL4 expression was higher in SP cells compared to non-SP cells by 2-4 fold in various malignant hematopoietic cell lines. Knocking down of SALL4 in isolated SP cells resulted in a reduction of SP cells, indicating that SALL4 is required for their self-renewal. The SP phenotype is known to be mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transport protein family, such as ABCG2 and ABCA3. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA), we demonstrated that SALL4 was able to bind to the promoter region of ABCA3 and activate its expression while regulating the expression of ABCG2 indirectly. Furthermore, SALL4 expression was positively correlated to those of ABCG2 and ABCA3 in primary leukemic patient samples. Taken together, our results suggest a novel role for SALL4 in drug sensitivity, at least in part through the maintenance of SP cells, and therefore may be responsible for drug-resistance in leukemia. We are the first to demonstrate a direct link between stem cell factor SALL4, SP and drug resistance in leukemia.","['Jeong, Ha-Won', 'Cui, Wei', 'Yang, Youyang', 'Lu, Jiayun', 'He, Jie', 'Li, Ailing', 'Song, David', 'Guo, Ye', 'Liu, Bee H', 'Chai, Li']","['Jeong HW', 'Cui W', 'Yang Y', 'Lu J', 'He J', 'Li A', 'Song D', 'Guo Y', 'Liu BH', 'Chai L']","[""The Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/08/17 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0018372 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Apr 19;6(4):e18372. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018372.,10.1371/journal.pone.0018372 [doi],20110419,"['0 (ABCA3 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Side-Population Cells/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Young Adult']","['P01 DK080665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL092437/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL092437/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01HL095489/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL095489/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL092437-A1S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3079717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective study of patients who developed candidaemia at Riyadh Armed Forces Hospital between January 1992 and December 2002 was carried out. Thirty one episodes of candidaemia occurred in 27 patients with a variety of haematological disorders. Twenty-four episodes were caused by non-albicans species of Candida and only 7 episodes were caused by C.albicans. The most frequent underlying haematological disorders were acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The main predisposing factors for the development of candidaemia were: broad spectrum antibiotics, central venous catheters, neutropenia, cytotoxic chemotherapy, coexisting bacterial infections, steroid therapy, relapsing or untreated primary disease and fluconazole prophylaxis.Eight episodes were complicated by chronic disseminated candidiasis. Amphotericin-B and amBisome were used in the treatment of Candida infections. The treatment was successful in 86% of the episodes of C. albicans and 50% of the episodes due to nonalbicans species of Candida. The highest mortality rate was encountered with C.tropicalis infections.Candidaemia is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with malignant haematological disorders and stem cell transplant. The predominance of non-albicans species of Candida especially C.krusei and C.tropicalis is alarming. The early administration of appropriate antifungal therapy and the removal of infected intravascular catheters improve the outcome considerably.","['Al-Anazi, Ka', 'Al-Jasser, Am']","['Al-Anazi K', 'Al-Jasser A']","['King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, King Faisal Cancer Centre, Section of Adult Haematology and Stem Cell Transplant.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Libyan J Med,The Libyan journal of medicine,101299403,2006/01/01 00:00,2006/01/01 00:01,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2006/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4176/061116 [doi]'],epublish,Libyan J Med. 2006 Nov 21;1(2):140-55. doi: 10.4176/061116.,10.4176/061116 [doi],20061121,,,,,PMC3081354,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Candida', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'chronic disseminated candidiasis', 'stem cell transplant']",,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor-associated lipogenesis can protect cancer cells from carcinogenic- and therapeutic-associated treatments. Increased synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol is regulated by androgens through induction of several genes in androgen-responsive cancer cells. Acetyl-CoA-carboxylase-alpha (ACCA) is a key enzyme in the regulation of fatty acids synthesis. Here we show that AR binds in vivo to intron regions of human ACCA gene. We also show that the level of ACCA protein in LNCaP depends on AR expression and that DHT treatment increases ACCA expression and fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of ACCA by TOFA (5-tetradecyl-oxy-2-furoic acid) decreases fatty acid synthesis and induces caspase activation and cell death in most PCa cell lines. Our data suggest that TOFA can kill cells via the mitochondrial pathway since we found cytochrome c release after TOFA treatment in androgen sensitive cell lines. The results also imply that the pro-apoptotic effect of TOFA may be mediated via a decrease of neuropilin-1(NRP1) and Mcl-1expression. We have previously reported that Mcl-1 is under AR regulation and plays an important role in resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, and NRP1 is known to regulate Mcl-1 expression. Here, we show for the first time that NRP1 expression is under AR control. Taken together, our data suggest that TOFA is a potent cell death inducing agent in prostate cancer cells.","['Guseva, Natalya V', 'Rokhlin, Oskar W', 'Glover, Rebecca A', 'Cohen, Michael B']","['Guseva NV', 'Rokhlin OW', 'Glover RA', 'Cohen MB']","['University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA. natalya-guseva@uiowa.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['15721 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.12.1.15721 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 Jul 1;12(1):80-5. doi: 10.4161/cbt.12.1.15721.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the frequency, characteristics and predictive factors of second cancers in 230 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) and compared the incidence of second cancers in WM with that of an age- and sex-matched control population. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (10%) developed solid cancers and 10 (4%) second hematologic malignancies. In a competing risk model, the cumulative incidence of solid cancers was 12% at 10 years and 17% at 15 years while the incidence of hematologic malignancies was 6% and 8%, respectively. The overall risk of second cancer in WM was 1.69 times higher than expected (P = 0.002). WM patients were at increased risk for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 9.24, P < 0.0001], myelodisplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (SIR 8.4, P < 0.0001), brain cancer (SIR 8.05, P = 0.0004). The risk of a second hematologic malignancy was fourfold higher in patients previously treated, though not reaching statistical significance (P = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: WM patients are at higher risk of second cancers as compared with the general population. The sample size does not allow firm conclusions about the effect of therapy on the development of second cancers.","['Varettoni, M', 'Tedeschi, A', 'Arcaini, L', 'Pascutto, C', 'Vismara, E', 'Orlandi, E', 'Ricci, F', 'Corso, A', 'Greco, A', 'Mangiacavalli, S', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Morra, E']","['Varettoni M', 'Tedeschi A', 'Arcaini L', 'Pascutto C', 'Vismara E', 'Orlandi E', 'Ricci F', 'Corso A', 'Greco A', 'Mangiacavalli S', 'Lazzarino M', 'Morra E']","['Division of Hematology, Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. m.varettoni@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,2011/04/29 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)34383-2 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdr119 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2012 Feb;23(2):411-5. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdr119.

This nonstochastic pairing could reflect steric factors that preclude these IgH from pairing with other IgL or selection for an Ig with a particular Ag-binding activity. We generated rIg with IGHV3-21-encoded IgH with HCDR3 motif-1 or -2 and IgL encoded by IGKV3-20 or IGLV3-21. Each IgH paired equally well with matched or mismatched kappa- or lambda-IgL to form functional Ig, which we screened for binding to an array of different Ags. Ig with IGLV3-21-encoded lambda-IgL could bind with an affinity of approximately 2 x 10(-6) M to protein L, a cell-wall protein of Peptostreptococcus magnus, independent of the IgH, indicating that protein L is a superantigen for IGLV3-21-encoded lambda-IgL. We also detected Ig binding to cofilin, a highly conserved actin-binding protein. However, cofilin binding was independent of native pairing of IgH and IgL and was not specific for Ig with IgH encoded by IGHV3-21. We conclude that steric factors or the binding activity for protein L or cofilin cannot account for the nonstochastic pairing of IgH and IgL observed for the stereotypic Ig made by CLL cells that express IGHV3-21.","['Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Ghia EM', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores University of California San Diego Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA 92093-0820, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0902875 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0902875 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Jun 1;186(11):6338-44. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0902875.

As the Forkhead box O (FoxO) tumor suppressors act as downstream effectors of PI3K/Akt, they represent good candidate targets whose dysregulation by Tax might be involved in HTLV-1-mediated activation and transformation of infected cells. In this report, we provide evidence showing that Tax induces a dose-dependent degradation of FoxO4 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consistent with that, we demonstrate that Tax expression increases the interaction between FoxO4 and Mdm2 E3 ligase, leading to a strong FoxO4 polyubiquitination. These processes require the phosphorylation of FoxO4 by Akt, since a mutant of FoxO4 with mutations on its three Akt phosphorylation sites appears to be resistant to Tax-mediated degradation and ubiquitination. In addition, we show that Tax expression is associated with degradation and phosphorylation of endogenous FoxO4 in Jurkat T cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Tax represses FoxO4 transcriptional activity. Our study demonstrates that Tax can control FoxO4 protein stability and transcriptional activity and provides new insight into the subversion of cell signaling pathways during HTLV-1 infection.","['Oteiza, Alexandra', 'Mechti, Nadir']","['Oteiza A', 'Mechti N']","[""CNRS UMR 5236, Centre d'Etudes d'Agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologie pour la Sante (CPBS), 1919 Route de Mende, 34 293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/08/27 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00036-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00036-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Jul;85(13):6480-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00036-11.

Its activity is regulated through intricate signaling networks. Persistent or excessive activation of NF-kappaB induces diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and malignant neoplasms. Infection by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a fatal hematopoietic malignancy termed adult T cell leukemia (ATL). The HTLV-1 viral oncoprotein Tax functions pivotally in leukemogenesis through its potent activation of NF-kappaB. Recent findings suggest that protein ubiquitination is crucial for proper regulation of NF-kappaB signaling and for Tax activity.

Our results point to USP20 as a key negative regulator of Tax-induced NF-kappaB signaling.","['Yasunaga, Junichiro', 'Lin, Frank C', 'Lu, Xiongbin', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh']","['Yasunaga J', 'Lin FC', 'Lu X', 'Jeang KT']","['Molecular Virology Section, Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/08/27 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00079-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00079-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Jul;85(13):6212-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00079-11.

Our previous studies have revealed that acquired tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance in lung cancer cells is associated with Akt-mediated stabilization of cellular caspase 8 and Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like apoptosis regulator-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). In this report, we show that cells with acquired TRAIL resistance have significantly increased capacities in migration and invasion. By gene expression screening, tissue transglutaminase (TGM2) was identified as one of the genes with the highest expression increase in TRAIL-resistant cells. Suppressing TGM2 dramatically alleviated TRAIL resistance and cell migration, suggesting that TGM2 contributes to these two phenotypes in TRAIL-resistant cells. TGM2-mediated TRAIL resistance is likely through c-FLIP because TGM2 suppression significantly reduced c-FLIP but not Mcl-1 expression. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was suppressed when TGM2 was inhibited, suggesting that TGM2 potentiates cell migration through up-regulating MMP-9 expression. We found that EGF receptor (EGFR) was highly active in the TRAIL-resistant cells, and suppression of EGFR dramatically reduced TGM2 expression. We further determined JNK and ERK, but not Akt and NF-kappaB, are responsible for EGFR-mediated TGM2 expression. These results identify a novel pathway that involves EGFR, MAPK (JNK and ERK), and TGM2 for acquired TRAIL resistance and cell migration in lung cancer cells. Because TGM2 couples TRAIL resistance and cell migration, it could be a molecular target for circumventing acquired chemoresistance and metastasis in lung cancer.","['Li, Zi', 'Xu, Xiuling', 'Bai, Lang', 'Chen, Wenshu', 'Lin, Yong']","['Li Z', 'Xu X', 'Bai L', 'Chen W', 'Lin Y']","['Molecular Biology and Lung Cancer Program, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)48999-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.207571 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 17;286(24):21164-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.207571.

In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with HSF in childhood. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients with the diagnosis of HSF in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan between July 1999 and June 2009. The definition of HSF included imaging studies demonstrating multiple focal lesions in the liver and/or spleen with or without a microbiologic evidence for fungal infection. The clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 15 pediatric patients with HSF. Eleven patients had diagnosis of hemato-oncologic malignancy, and two patients had severe aplastic anemia. All patients had fever, and most patients had abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and hepatosplenomegaly. The detection rate of computed tomography scan (15/15, 100%) was superior to abdominal sonography (10/15, 67%, p = 0.01). Ten (91%) of the 11 patients with microbiologic evidence were infected by Candida species. Neither recurrence nor breakthrough fungal infection was noted when the patients underwent further chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Six patients (40%) died before the end of the study, but no mortality was directly related to HSF. CONCLUSION: Candida species was the major pathogen for HSF, and computed tomography scan was a good diagnostic tool to detect the multiple focal lesions. Under adequate antifungal treatment, HSF could be cured without recurrence in spite of further chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation.","['Yen, Ting-Yu', 'Huang, Li Min', 'Lee, Ping-Ing', 'Lu, Chun-Yi', 'Shao, Pei-Lan', 'Chang, Luan-Yin']","['Yen TY', 'Huang LM', 'Lee PI', 'Lu CY', 'Shao PL', 'Chang LY']","['Department of Pediatric, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",100956211,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1684-1182(11)00052-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmii.2010.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2011 Aug;44(4):296-302. doi: 10.1016/j.jmii.2010.08.005.

The purpose of this study was to indirectly compare rates of major molecular response (MMR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival by month 12 with nilotinib and dasatinib treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP. METHODS: Individual patient data from a randomized trial of nilotinib vs. imatinib (ENESTnd) and published summary data from a separate randomized trial of dasatinib vs. imatinib (DASISION) were utilized. A matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted by weighting individual patients treated with nilotinib to match baseline characteristics reported for dasatinib-treated patients, including age, gender, ECOG performance status and hematology lab values. After matching, efficacy outcomes were compared for patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs. dasatinib 100 mg once daily. Patients randomized to imatinib 400 mg once daily in each trial were used to assess the adequacy of the matching. RESULTS: Before matching, patients randomized to nilotinib in ENESTnd (n = 273) were older, with a lower median platelet count and more favorable performance status compared to patients randomized to dasatinib in DASISION (n = 259). After matching, all baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups. Matched patients treated with nilotinib vs. dasatinib experienced significantly higher rates of MMR (56.8 vs. 45.9%, p = 0.014) and overall survival (99.5 vs. 97.3%, p = 0.046) and numerically higher rates of PFS (98.8 vs. 96.5%). Matched imatinib arms showed no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in these outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Baseline measures unavailable in one or both trials could not be matched. Adverse event rates were not formally compared across trials due to differences in reporting.

Success without modification, with modification, protocol failure, duration of treatment were 45.9%, 35.1%, 18.9%, and 10 days in PIP/TAZO arm and 42.9%, 37.1%, 20%, and 12 days in combination arm, respectively (P > .05). There was no significant difference between the empirical therapy arms regarding median duration of neutropenia and defervescence of fever. Empirical therapy was substituted by other drugs in 6 and 5 episodes in PIP/TAZO and combination arms, respectively. There was no infection-related death. There was reversible increase in serum creatinine in 1 episode on the combination arm. Monotherapy with PIP/TAZO was effective and safe for initial empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes in children with AL. However, local bacterial resistance patterns should be considered in daily practice. Combination of amikacin with PIP/TAZO did not improve treatment success, but it may increase nephrotoxicity.","['Zengin, Emine', 'Sarper, Nazan', 'Kilic, Suar Caki']","['Zengin E', 'Sarper N', 'Kilic SC']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,2011/04/29 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2011.557144 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 May;28(4):311-20. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2011.557144.,10.3109/08880018.2011.557144 [doi],,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '87-53-6 (Penicillanic Acid)', 'SE10G96M8W (Tazobactam)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Amikacin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Penicillanic Acid/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Piperacillin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Tazobactam', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib may overcome the adverse prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9. METHODS: A study was undertaken to investigate the prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 in 353 patients with CML receiving the second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) nilotinib (n = 161) or dasatinib (n = 192). RESULTS: Deletion of derivative chromosome 9 status was determined in 245 (69%). Twenty-eight (11%) patients, 22 in chronic phase, 4 in accelerated phase, and 2 in blast phase, carried deletions of derivative chromosome 9, including 17 receiving nilotinib and 11 receiving dasatinib (P = .47). Overall survival (OS) at 24 months was similar between patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 (70% vs 71%, P = .76). For patients in chronic phase, no significant differences in overall major cytogenetic response (77% vs 82%, P = .57) or complete cytogenetic response (77% vs 81%, P = .71) rates were observed between patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9. At 24 months, patients with CML in chronic phase without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 had improved event-free survival (EFS) (88% vs 66%, P = .07) and OS (96% vs 82%; P = .08) compared with those carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9. However, multivariate analysis established second-line versus frontline second generation TKI therapy as the only adverse prognostic factor for EFS and increased bone marrow blast burden and older age as independent adverse prognostic factors for OS. CONCLUSIONS: Deletions of derivative chromosome 9 do not appear to be an independent risk factor for survival among patients with CML in chronic phase receiving second generation TKIs.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Shan J', 'Jabbour E', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Verstovsek S', 'Garcia-Manero G', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/28 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26147 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Nov 15;117(22):5085-93. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26147.

Because it is believed that regulatory T cells (T(regs) ) are potent suppressors of antitumor immunity, the authors hypothesized that increased T(regs) may favor disease progression. METHODS: T(reg) levels (cluster of differentiation 3 [CD3]-positive, [CD4]-positive, CD25-positive, and CD127-negative) in peripheral blood from 102 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate correlations with clinical data. RESULTS: The relative T(reg) numbers in CD4-positive T cells were significantly greater in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared with the numbers in a control group of 170 healthy individuals (P = .001). Patients were divided into 2 groups using a median T(reg) value of 9.7% (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells). Patients with higher T(reg) levels had a significantly shorter time to initial treatment (median, 5.9 years) compared with patients who had lower T(reg) levels (median, 11.7 years; log-rank P = .019). Furthermore, T(reg) levels (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) had significant prognostic power to predict the time to initial treatment in univariate analysis (P = .023) and in multivariate Cox regression analysis that included the variables Rai stage, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and CD38 expression (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: Higher T(reg) levels had significant and independent prognostic power for predicting the time to initial treatment in patients with low to intermediate stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Weiss, Lukas', 'Melchardt, Thomas', 'Egle, Alexander', 'Grabmer, Christoph', 'Greil, Richard', 'Tinhofer, Inge']","['Weiss L', 'Melchardt T', 'Egle A', 'Grabmer C', 'Greil R', 'Tinhofer I']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department With Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology, and Infectious Disease of the Private Medical University Hospital of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/28 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25752 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 May 15;117(10):2163-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25752.

METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome of 166 cases of adult AML patients who were homogeneously treated with a fludarabine-based induction therapy. RESULTS: ABCG2 overexpression and FLT3-ITD were detected in 83 (50%) and 47 (28%) patients, respectively. A significant correlation was found between ABCG2 positivity and FLT3 mutation, with 33 (40%) ITD in 83 ABCG2-positive patients compared with 14 (17%) ITD in 83 ABCG2-negative patients (P = .002). Complete remission (CR) after induction therapy was achieved in 95 (57%) patients. Neither ABCG2 overexpression nor FLT3-ITD had any impact on achievement of CR. Relapse occurred in 42 of 95 (44%) patients at a median time of 28 months. Time to relapse was shortened in patients overexpressing ABCG2 (P = .0004). DFS was not affected by FLT3-ITD alone, but FLT3 mutation significantly worsened long-term outcome of ABCG2-positive patients. DFS at 1 and 3 years in patients with overexpression of both ABCG2 and FLT3-ITD was only 36% and 28%, respectively; in ABCG2-positive/FLT3-negative patients, DFS at 1 and 3 years was 65% and 48%, respectively; and in ABCG2-negative cases (regardless of FLT3 status), DFS at 1 and 3 years was greater than 85% and 75%. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant overexpression of ABCG2 and FLT3-ITD is relatively frequent and identifies a subgroup of AML patients with a significantly worse prognosis.

METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed AML were divided among 3 cytogenetic subgroups: core binding factor (CBF) AML, NK-AML, and poor-risk AML. RESULTS: In total, 481 patients were included: 13% had, CBF-AML, 57% had NK-AML, and 30% had poor risk AML, and the frequency of any FLT3 mutations was 20%, 32%, and 7.6% in the respective cytogenetic subgroups. FLT3 mutation did not have an impact on event-free survival (EFS) in patients with CBF-AML (P = .84) and poor-risk AML (P = .37). In patients with NK-AML, EFS was worse in the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) group (20 weeks vs 41 weeks; P < .00,001) but not in the FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) point mutation group (61 weeks vs 41 weeks; P = .15). Worse EFS and overall survival (OS) were observed among patients with NK-AML and higher FLT3-ITD burden but not among patients with FLT3-TKD mutation. In multivariate analysis, FLT3-ITD mutation was prognostic of EFS in patients with NK-AML (hazard ratio, 3.1; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: FLT3 mutations did not have a prognostic impact in patients with AML who had good-risk and poor-risk karyotypes.

The clinical significance of this reaction remains unknown. METHODS: Forty-five patients with CLL who were treated with lenalidomide in a phase 2 clinical trial were evaluated for the clinical features, intensity, and duration of TFR. Correlation was made with tumor response and the immune cellular microenvironment. Steroids for the prophylaxis of TFR was not given to patients in Group A (n = 29) whereas patients in Group B (n = 16) received low-dose prednisone as well as a slow dose escalation of lenalidomide for the prevention of TFR. RESULTS: Thirty (67%) patients experienced a TFR, with a grade 2 or 3 reaction (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) observed in 33% of patients (47% in Group A and 9% in Group B; P = .05). The median time to onset of the TFR was 6 days, and was longer in the patients receiving prophylaxis (4 days vs 9 days, respectively; P = .01). A complete response was observed in 7 of 30 (23%) patients with TFR and 1 of 15 (7%) patients without TFR. The median progression-free survival was 19.9 months and 19.4 months, respectively, for patients with versus those without TFR (P = .92).

Noscapinoids show great promise as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of human cancers. To investigate the structural determinants of noscapinoids responsible for anti-cancer activity, we tested 36 structurally diverse noscapinoids in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM). The IC(50) values of these noscapinoids vary from 1.2 to 56.0 muM. Pharmacophore models of anti-cancer activity were generated that identify two hydrogen bond acceptors, two aromatic rings, two hydrophobic groups, and one positively charged group as essential structural features. Additionally, an atom-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was developed that gave a statistically satisfying result (R(2) = 0.912, Q(2) = 0.908, Pearson R = 0.951) and effectively predicts the anti-cancer activity of training and test set compounds. The pharmacophore model presented here is well supported by electronic property analysis using density functional theory at B3LYP/3-21*G level. Molecular electrostatic potential, particularly localization of negative potential near oxygen atoms of the dimethoxy isobenzofuranone ring of active compounds, matched the hydrogen bond acceptor feature of the generated pharmacophore. Our results further reveal that all active compounds have smaller lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies concentrated over the dimethoxy isobenzofuranone ring, azido group, and nitro group, which is indicative of the electron acceptor capacity of the compounds. Results obtained from this study will be useful in the efficient design and development of more active noscapinoids.","['Naik, Pradeep K', 'Santoshi, Seneha', 'Joshi, Harish C']","['Naik PK', 'Santoshi S', 'Joshi HC']","['Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. pnaik2@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Model,Journal of molecular modeling,9806569,2011/04/28 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00894-011-1057-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Model. 2012 Jan;18(1):307-18. doi: 10.1007/s00894-011-1057-9.

Jurkat, HL-60, K562, and HPB-ALL cells were exposed to the drugs alone or in combinations. Cell viability was measured using WST-1 or XTT reduction tests and ROS production by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining (flow cytometry). Modulation of (a) intracellular glutathione (GSH) level was done by using L: -buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or diethylmaleate (DEM), (b) NADPH oxidase by using diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), and (c) MAP kinases by using SB202190 (p38), SP600125 (JNK), and U0126 (ERK) inhibitors. ATO cytotoxicity (0.5 or 1 muM) was enhanced by sulindacs, with higher activity showed by the metabolites. Strong cytotoxic effects appeared at SS and SF concentrations starting from 50 muM. The induction of ROS production seemed not to be the major mechanism responsible for the cytotoxicity of the combinations. A strong potentiating effect of BSO on ATO cytotoxicity was demonstrated; DEM (10-300 muM) and DPI (0.0025-0.1 muM; 72 h) did not influence the effects of ATO. Some significant decreases in the viability of the cells exposed to ATO in the presence of MAPK inhibitors comparing with the cells exposed to ATO alone were observed; however, the effects likely resulted from a simple additive cytotoxicity of the drugs. The combinations of ATO with sulindacs offer potential therapeutic usefulness.","['Stepnik, M', 'Ferlinska, M', 'Smok-Pieniazek, A', 'Gradecka-Meesters, D', 'Arkusz, J', 'Stanczyk, M']","['Stepnik M', 'Ferlinska M', 'Smok-Pieniazek A', 'Gradecka-Meesters D', 'Arkusz J', 'Stanczyk M']","['Department of Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, 8 Sw.

Although this was significantly higher in patients with complete molecular response (CMR) than in those without (1,430 vs. 859 ng/ml, P = 0.04), the difference was not significant in the sub-population treated with a standard dose of IM (400 mg/day).

Recent evidence shows that fundamental changes in the epigenetic status of HSCs might be one of the driving forces behind many age-related HSC changes and might pave the way for HSC malignant transformation and subsequent leukemia development, the incidence of which increases exponentially with age. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are key epigenetic regulators of HSC cellular fate decisions and are often found to be misregulated in human hematopoietic malignancies. In this review, we speculate that PcG proteins balance HSC aging against the risk of developing cancer, since a disturbance in PcG genes and proteins affects several important cellular processes such as cell fate decisions, senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair.","['Klauke, Karin', 'de Haan, Gerald']","['Klauke K', 'de Haan G']","['Department of Cell Biology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, A.

Emerging data has identified molecular markers that provide additional prognostic information to better classify these patients into those with a more favorable prognosis and those with an unfavorable prognosis who may require more aggressive or investigational therapies. Markers such as mutations in nucleophosmin 1 gene and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha gene have been associated with a more favorable prognosis in CN-AML. In contrast, FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 mutations, partial tandem duplication of mixed-lineage leukemia gene and overexpression of brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic gene are associated with inferior clinical outcomes. In this article, the authors discuss the classical clinical features of AML and the importance of cytogenetics that predict prognosis in AML.

Our aim was to assess vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters in acute myeloid leukemia patients and develop an improved dosing equation to attain more accurate initial therapeutic trough levels. Acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving vancomycin for a presumed or documented gram positive infection were eligible. Patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, those with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min or with limb amputation were excluded. Three samples were collected at the following post-infusion time ranges: 1 h, 3-8 h, and 8-24 h post-infusion, contingent on the dosing interval. Pharmacokinetic data were then fit using a Bayesian-based population pharmacokinetic model. A total of 25 acute myeloid leukemia patients were studied with a mean volume in the central compartment (Vc; L/65 kg), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss; L/65 kg) and distributional clearance (CLd; L/h/65 kg) of 15, 38.9, and 9.32, respectively. CLslope was 0.59 (mg of vancomycin clearance per unit of creatinine clearance in mL/min); this value is 21.4% lower than the established literature value (0.75). The derived equation, based upon these values, was reasonably precise at achieving the desired trough concentration using a priori dosing. The mean (CV%) of the achieved trough was 94% (29%) with a range of 66-188%; 3/25 at <75% and >125%]. We have established that the derived dosing equation can place approximately 75% of adult acute myeloid leukemia patients at vancomycin trough levels within 75-125% of the target trough level.","['Jarkowski, Anthony 3rd', 'Forrest, Alan', 'Sweeney, Richard P', 'Tan, Wei', 'Segal, Brahm H', 'Almyroudis, Nikolaos', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Jarkowski A 3rd', 'Forrest A', 'Sweeney RP', 'Tan W', 'Segal BH', 'Almyroudis N', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

The oncogenic function of MLL fusion proteins is, in part, mediated through aberrant activation of Hoxa genes and Meis1, among others. Here we demonstrate using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated loss of function mouse model that DOT1L, an H3K79 methyltransferase, is required for both initiation and maintenance of MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Through gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis we demonstrate that mistargeting of DOT1L, subsequent H3K79 methylation, and up-regulation of Hoxa and Meis1 genes underlie the molecular mechanism of how DOT1L contributes to MLL-AF9-mediated leukemogenesis. Our study not only provides the first in vivo evidence for the function of DOT1L in leukemia, but also reveals the molecular mechanism for DOT1L in MLL-AF9 mediated leukemia. Thus, DOT1L may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia caused by MLL translocations.","['Nguyen, Anh Tram', 'Taranova, Olena', 'He, Jin', 'Zhang, Yi']","['Nguyen AT', 'Taranova O', 'He J', 'Zhang Y']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/28 06:00,2011/09/06 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44887-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-334359 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 23;117(25):6912-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-334359.

The MAN2B1 transcript level correlates with enzyme activity, indicating a transcriptional up-regulation of the alpha-D-mannosidase gene. The promoter was then characterized in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) and HL60 cells; regulatory sequences crucial for its activity were determined by reporter gene assay in HEK-293 cells and located in the region -101/-71 with respect to the first ATG codon. Supershift assay demonstrated that Sp1 (specificity protein 1) bound to this sequence both in HEK-293 and HL60 cells. However, 5'-RACE (5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends) indicated the use of multiple upstream TSSs (transcription start sites) in HL60 with respect to HEK-293 cells and gel shift analysis of the sequence -373/-269 demonstrated a specific binding by NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) transcription factor in HL60 but not in HEK-293 cells.

More importantly, the demonstration of constitutive kinase activity emanating from the JAK2 protein provided the rationale for the development of small-molecule JAK2 kinase inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: Several JAK2 kinase inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials for patients with MPNs. In PMF trials, JAK2 inhibitors have been shown to produce rapid reductions in spleen size and marked improvements in constitutional symptoms and quality of life. In ET and/or PV, JAK2 inhibitors normalize hematocrit, platelets and WBC, and spleen size in a large number of patients that are resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea. JAK2 inhibitors are not specific for the JAK2V617F mutant protein. Rather, they inhibit the JAK2- signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and therefore any patient with MPN may benefit from therapy regardless of JAK2 mutational status. EXPERT OPINION: JAK2 inhibitors induce clinically relevant responses in a large proportion of patients with MPNs. Because JAK kinase activation underlies the pathogenesis of other disorders, such as autoimmune and rheumatological disorders, the paradigm of JAK inhibition may translate into novel therapies for a variety of human diseases.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Verstovsek S']","['UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,2011/04/28 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.579560 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Jul;20(7):961-72. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.579560.

Developing new therapies remains a priority as present treatment options do not offer a cure. BCL-2 overexpression in CLL is associated with aggressive disease features and resists chemotherapy. Oblimersen sodium (G3139) is a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide antisense drug targeting the BCL-2 mRNA and is the first antisense to reach advanced clinical testing in oncology. Preclinical evaluation has demonstrated good antineoplastic effect in B-cell cancers; several clinical trials have confirmed its safety and efficacy both alone and in combination with other therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and clinical evaluation of oblimersen in CLL. PubMed and MEDLINE searches assisted in data collection. EXPERT OPINION: Bcl-2 is an important target in CLL. Antisense therapy is a novel approach to target oncoproteins; this can be beneficial in the clinical setting. Oblimersen sodium demonstrates the clinical safety of the antisense therapeutic approach and, with chemotherapy, shows survival advantage in a subset of CLL patients. However, future approval of oblimersen sodium in CLL remains uncertain. Nevertheless, BCL-2 remains a critical target in drug development and is an area of high-priority research.","['Advani, Pooja P', 'Paulus, Aneel', 'Masood, Ayesha', 'Sher, Taimur', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher']","['Advani PP', 'Paulus A', 'Masood A', 'Sher T', 'Chanan-Khan A']","['State University of New York at Buffalo, Department of Internal Medicine, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,2011/04/28 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17425255.2011.579105 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2011 Jun;7(6):765-74. doi: 10.1517/17425255.2011.579105.

Eighty-six patients with newly diagnosed ALL were studied. A bacteremic episode was defined as blood isolation of a pathogen in the presence of clinical symptomatology of septicaemia. Bacteremias were analyzed according to the treatment element being delivered and the degree of neutropenia. A central venous catheter (CVC) was inserted at diagnosis in all patients. Fifty-two episodes of bacteremias were encountered in 38/86 (44%) patients, while 48/86 patients had no positive blood culture. Three out of the 38 patients had bacteremia and CVC area infection, simultaneously. Most blood stream infections (29/52, 56%) were documented during the induction phase. Isolated Gram-positive organisms were 48%, Gram-negative 50% and 2% of the positive blood cultures represented fungaemias. The most common Gram-positive isolates were Staphylococcus species (N=22) and the commonest Gram-negative isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The majority of bacteremias (75%) occurred during neutropenia. The initial antibiotic treatment was ceftazidime or piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin or tobramycin. CVC was not removed in the majority of bacteremias (94%). No infection related fatality was recorded. Bacteremias constituted a severe and common complication in our patient cohort. However, infection-related fatality rate was negligible, most probably due to the prompt initiation of broad coverage antimicrobial therapy.","['Katsibardi, K', 'Papadakis, V', 'Charisiadou, A', 'Pangalis, A', 'Polychronopoulou, S']","['Katsibardi K', 'Papadakis V', 'Charisiadou A', 'Pangalis A', 'Polychronopoulou S']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Thivon Livadias Ave Goudi, Athens, Greece. katharinakats@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,2011/04/28 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2011_04_326 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2011;58(4):326-30. doi: 10.4149/neo_2011_04_326.,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/*etiology/microbiology', 'Ceftazidime/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Piperacillin/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, subsequent lead optimizations often rely on other types of computational methods, such as de novo design methods. We have developed an automatic method, namely automatic tailoring and transplanting (AutoT&T), which can effectively utilize the outcomes of virtual screening in lead optimization. This method detects suitable fragments on virtual screening hits and then transplants them onto a lead compound to generate new ligand molecules. Binding affinities, synthetic feasibilities, and drug-likeness properties are considered in the selection of final designs. In this study, our AutoT&T program was tested on three different target proteins, including p38 MAP kinase, PPAR-alpha, and Mcl-1. In the first two cases, AutoT&T was able to produce molecules identical or similar to known inhibitors with better potency than the given lead compound. In the third case, we demonstrated how to apply AutoT&T to design novel ligand molecules from scratch. Compared to the solutions generated by other two de novo design methods, i.e., LUDI and EA-Inventor, the solutions generated by AutoT&T were structurally more diverse and more promising in terms of binding scores in all three cases. AutoT&T also completed the assigned jobs more efficiently than LUDI and EA-Inventor by several folds. Our AutoT&T method has certain technical advantages over de novo design methods. Importantly, it expands the application of virtual screening from lead discovery to lead optimization and thus may serve as a valuable tool for many researchers.","['Li, Yan', 'Zhao, Yuan', 'Liu, Zhihai', 'Wang, Renxiao']","['Li Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Liu Z', 'Wang R']","[""State Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,2011/04/28 06:00,2011/10/22 06:00,['2011/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ci200036m [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2011 Jun 27;51(6):1474-91. doi: 10.1021/ci200036m.

Our current study investigated the mechanism of degradation of cell surface-resident ABCA1, focusing on ubiquitination. A coimmunoprecipitation study indicated the presence of ubiquitinated ABCA1 in the plasma membrane of the human hepatoma cell line, HuH-7, of cells from mouse liver, and of macrophages differentiated from the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 (THP-1 macrophages). In HuH-7 cells, degradation of cell surface-resident ABCA1 was inhibited by the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of ubiquitin. Moreover, the disruption of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, a dominant mechanism for ubiquitination-mediated lysosomal degradation, by the knockdown of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS), significantly delayed the degradation of cell surface-resident ABCA1. This was accompanied by an increase in ABCA1 expression as well as in apoA-I-mediated [3H]-cholesterol efflux function. The effect of HRS knockdown was also observed after calpain inhibitor treatment, which is reported to retard ABCA1 degradation. The induction of ABCA1 by HRS knockdown was confirmed in THP-1 macrophages. CONCLUSION: Together with the fact that lysosomal inhibitor treatments increased ABCA1 expression in HuH-7 and THP-1 macrophages, these results suggest that ubiquitination mediates the lysosomal degradation of cell surface-resident ABCA1 through the ESCRT pathway, and thereby controls the expression and cholesterol efflux function of ABCA1. This mechanism seems to mediate ABCA1 degradation independently of the calpain-involving pathway. The modulation of ABCA1 ubiquitination could thus be a potential new therapeutic target for antiatherogenic drugs.","['Mizuno, Tadahaya', 'Hayashi, Hisamitsu', 'Naoi, Sotaro', 'Sugiyama, Yuichi']","['Mizuno T', 'Hayashi H', 'Naoi S', 'Sugiyama Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacokinetics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.24387 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2011 Aug;54(2):631-43. doi: 10.1002/hep.24387.

We found that the K562/Dox cell line was significantly more resistant to Cl-IB-MECA than the maternal cell line K562, which did not express P-gp. Although both cell lines expressed the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR), cytotoxic effects of Cl-IB-MECA were not prevented by its selective antagonist MRS1523 (3-propyl-6-ethyl-5-[(ethylthio)carbonyl]-2 phenyl-4-propyl-3-pyridine carboxylate). Analysis of cell extracts revealed that the intracellular level of Cl-IB-MECA was significantly lower in the K562/Dox cell line than in the maternal cell line K562. The downregulation of P-gp expression using shRNA targeting ABCB1 gene led to increased intracellular level of Cl-IB-MECA and restored cell sensitivity to this drug. Similarly, valspodar (PSC-833), a specific inhibitor of P-gp, restored sensitivity of the K562/Dox cell line to Cl-IB-MECA with concomitant increase of intracellular level of Cl-IB-MECA in the resistant cell line, while it affected cytotoxicity of Cl-IB-MECA in the sensitive cell line only marginally. An enzyme based assay provided evidence for interaction of P-gp with Cl-IB-MECA. We further observed that cytotoxic effects of Cl-IB-MECA could be augmented by activation of extrinsic cell death pathway by Apo-2L (TRAIL) but not FasL or TNF-alpha. Our results revealed that Cl-IB-MECA induced an increase in expression of TRAIL receptors in K562 cells, which could sensitize cells to apoptosis induction via an extrinsic cell death pathway. Importantly, these effects were inversely related to P-gp expression. In addition, MRS1523 did not affect Cl-IB-MECA induced expression of TRAIL receptors.","['Mlejnek, Petr', 'Dolezel, Petr', 'Kosztyu, Petr']","['Mlejnek P', 'Dolezel P', 'Kosztyu P']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic. mlejnek_petr@volny.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,2011/04/27 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22775 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Feb;227(2):676-85. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22775.,10.1002/jcp.22775 [doi],,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A3)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', ""Z07JR07J6C (2-chloro-N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide)""]",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Receptor, Adenosine A3/*metabolism']",,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to assess the risk of specific second malignancies after a childhood NCNSSC. Diagnosis and follow-up data on 10,988 cases of NCNSSC in children (0-14 years) were obtained from 13 registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and cumulative incidence of second malignancies were computed. We observed 175 second malignant neoplasms, yielding a SIR of 4.6, 95% CI: 3.9-5.3. When considering second cancers with at least 10 occurrences, highest relative risks were found for second malignant bone tumors (SIR = 26.4, 16.6-40.0), soft tissue sarcomas (SIR = 14.1, 6.7-25.8) and myeloid leukemia (SIR = 12.7, 6.3-22.8). Significant increased risks for all malignancies combined were observed after sympathetic nervous system tumors (SIR = 11.4, 5.2-21.6), retinoblastomas (SIR = 7.3, 5.4-9.8), renal tumors (SIR = 5.7, 3.8-8.0), malignant bone tumors (SIR = 5.6, 3.7-8.2), soft tissue sarcomas (SIR = 4.7, 3.2-6.8), germ-cell, trophoblastic and other gonadal neoplasms (SIR = 2.5, 1.1-4.9), carcinomas and other malignant epithelial neoplasms (SIR = 2.2, 1.4-3.3). The highest risk of a second malignancy of any type occurred 5 to 9 years after NCNSSC (SIR = 9.9, 6.8-13.9). The cumulative incidence of second malignancies 10 years after the first neoplasm was eight times higher among NCNSSC survivors than in the general population, with the absolute difference between observed and expected cumulative incidence still increasing after 50 years of follow-up. Children who survived a NCNSSC experience a large increased risk of developing a new malignancy, even many years after their initial diagnosis.","['Maule, Milena', 'Scelo, Ghislaine', 'Pastore, Guido', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Tracey, Elizabeth', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Brewster, David H', 'Tamaro, Sharon', 'Chia, Kee-Seng', 'Pompe-Kirn, Vera', 'Kliewer, Erich V', 'Tonita, Jon M', 'Martos, Carmen', 'Jonasson, Jon G', 'Merletti, Franco', 'Boffetta, Paolo']","['Maule M', 'Scelo G', 'Pastore G', 'Brennan P', 'Hemminki K', 'Olsen JH', 'Tracey E', 'Pukkala E', 'Weiderpass E', 'Brewster DH', 'Tamaro S', 'Chia KS', 'Pompe-Kirn V', 'Kliewer EV', 'Tonita JM', 'Martos C', 'Jonasson JG', 'Merletti F', 'Boffetta P']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, CPO Piemonte, CeRMS, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. milena.maule@cpo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,2011/04/27 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26135 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Oct 15;129(8):1940-52. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26135.

Thirty-eight TX children with a median age of 13 (range 3-19) years were investigated. Mental health was assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-20). Each mother's own mental health and QOL were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) and the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS). Forty children with ALL [median age 11 (8.5-15.4) years] and 42 healthy children [median age 11 (8.9- 15) years] served as controls. Treadmill exercise results from 22 of the 38 patients were included in the analysis. TX children showed significantly higher levels of mental health problems and lower HRQOL at 2 to 16 years after transplantation compared to both control groups. Body mass index and maximal oxygen uptake (n = 22/38) were significant predictors of child mental health (SDQ) and child QOL (PedsQL), respectively. Based on these results, we suggest that rehabilitation after TX should include a focus on physical activity and QOL to reduce interconnected physical and psychological morbidity in kidney TX children.","['Diseth, Trond H', 'Tangeraas, Trine', 'Reinfjell, Trude', 'Bjerre, Anna']","['Diseth TH', 'Tangeraas T', 'Reinfjell T', 'Bjerre A']","[""Department of Clinical Neurosciences for Children, Women and Children's Division, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. trond.diseth@oslo-universitetssykehus.no""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/12/22 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00467-011-1887-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 2011 Oct;26(10):1881-92. doi: 10.1007/s00467-011-1887-9.

FLT3-ITDs are known to drive hematopoietic stem cells towards FLT3 ligand independent growth, but the effects on dendritic cell (DC) differentiation during leukemogenesis are not clear. We compared the frequency of cells with immunophenotype of myeloid DC (mDC: Lin(-), HLA-DR(+), CD11c(+), CD86(+)) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC: Lin(-), HLA-DR(+), CD123(+), CD86(+)) in diagnostic samples of 47 FLT3-ITD(-) and 40 FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients. The majority of ITD(+) AML samples showed high frequencies of mDCs or pDCs, with significantly decreased HLA-DR expression compared with DCs detectable in ITD(-) AML samples. Interestingly, mDCs and pDCs sorted out from ITD(+) AML samples contained the ITD insert revealing their leukemic origin and, upon ex vivo culture with cytokines, they acquired DC morphology. Notably, mDC/pDCs were detectable concurrently with single lineage mDCs and pDCs in all ITD(+) AML (n = 11) and ITD(-) AML (n = 12) samples analyzed for mixed lineage DCs (Lin(-), HLA-DR(+), CD11c(+), CD123(+)). ITD(+) AML mDCs/pDCs could be only partially activated with CD40L and CpG for production of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-1alpha, which may affect the anti-leukemia immune surveillance in the course of disease progression.","['Rickmann, Mareike', 'Krauter, Juergen', 'Stamer, Kathrin', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Salguero, Gustavo', 'Mischak-Weissinger, Eva', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Stripecke, Renata']","['Rickmann M', 'Krauter J', 'Stamer K', 'Heuser M', 'Salguero G', 'Mischak-Weissinger E', 'Ganser A', 'Stripecke R']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1231-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Sep;90(9):1047-58. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1231-2.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which cryptotanshinone is in synergy with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) for the induction of apoptosis in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) KBM-5 cells. The co-treatment of cryptotanshinone with TNF-alpha reduced the viability of the cells [combination index (CI) < 1]. Concomitantly, the co-treatment of cryptotanshinone and TNF-alpha elicited apoptosis, manifested by enhanced the number of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP-nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, the sub-G1 cell populations, and the activation of caspase-8 and -3, in comparison with the treatment with either drug alone. The treatment with cryptotanshinone further suppressed TNF-alpha-mediated expression of c-FLIP(L), Bcl-x(L), but the increased level of tBid (a caspase-8 substrate). Furthermore, cryptotanshinone activated p38 but not NF-kappaB in TNF-alpha-treated KBM-5 cells. The addition of a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 significantly attenuated cryptotanshinone/TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. The combination treatment of cryptotanshinone and TNF-alpha also stimulated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger) was not only able to block cryptotanshinone/TNF-alpha-induced ROS production but also the activation of caspase-8 and p38 MAPK. Overall, our findings suggest that cryptotanshinone can sensitize TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia KBM-5 cells, which appears through ROS-dependent activation of caspase-8 and p38.","['Kim, Ji-Hyun', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Kwon, Tae-Rin', 'Yun, Sun-Mi', 'Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Kim, Minseok', 'Lee, Hyo-Jung', 'Lee, Min-Ho', 'Ko, Seong Gyu', 'Chen, Chang-Yan', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Kim JH', 'Jeong SJ', 'Kwon TR', 'Yun SM', 'Jung JH', 'Kim M', 'Lee HJ', 'Lee MH', 'Ko SG', 'Chen CY', 'Kim SH']","['Cancer Preventive Material Development Research Center, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea. sungkim7@khu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0605-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2011 Jul;16(7):696-707. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0605-1.,10.1007/s10495-011-0605-1 [doi],,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5E9SXT166N (cryptotanshinone)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K8 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",['R01 CA100498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AVE9633 is an anti-CD33-maytansine conjugate created by ImmunoGen Inc. Phase I trials of AVE9633 were performed in patients with AML to evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Three phase I studies of AVE9633 were performed in 54 patients with refractory/relapsed AML, evaluating drug infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (Day 1 study), day 1 and 8 (Day 1/8 study) and day 1, 4 and 7 (Day 1/4/7 study) of a 28-day cycle. Toxicity was mainly allergic reaction during infusion (3 grade 3 bronchospasms). DLT was reached for the D1-D7 schedule at 150 mg/sqm (1 keratitis, 1 liver toxicity), and the MTD was set at 130 mg/sqm for this schedule. In the two other phases I, the DLT was not reached. In the Day 1/8 study, CD33 on peripheral blasts was saturated and down-modulated for doses of 75 mg/m(2) x 2 or higher, which was correlated with WBC kinetics and plasma levels of AVE9633. Decrease of DM4/CD33 ratio on the blasts surface between day 1 and 8 was the rational for evaluating day 1/4/7 schedule. This induced relatively constant DM4/CD33 levels over the first 8 days, however no activity was noted. One CRp, one PR and biological activity in five other patients were observed in this study. The Day 1 and Day 1/4/7 studies were early discontinued because of drug inactivity at doses significantly higher than CD33 -saturating doses.

In this review, we discuss the current state of cellular immunotherapy as adjuvant therapy for AML, with a particular focus on new strategies and recently published results of preclinical and clinical studies. Therapeutic vaccines that are being tested in AML include whole tumour cells as an autologous source of multiple leukaemia-associated antigens (LAA) and autologous dendritic cells loaded with LAA as effective antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T cells or natural killer cells is under active investigation.

It is usually associated with oncologic, infectious, and hematologic diseases and more seldom with other rare causes. Pathologic splenic rupture related to hematologic malignancy seems to be rare with only 136 cases reported from 1861 until 1996 and a few cases thereafter. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia are most frequently reported followed by chronic myeloid leukemia and lymphoblastic acute leukemia. However, even in cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pathologic splenic rupture as the presenting symptom of the disease is rare as is the presence of primary splenic lymphoma. Conservative treatment is not an option, while operative intervention and emergency splenectomy is the only feasible treatment.

Rearrangement of the ERG gene with the TMPRSS2 gene has been identified in the majority of prostate cancer patients. Additionally, overexpression of ERG is associated with unfavorable prognosis in prostate cancer patients similar to leukemia patients. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate transcription as well as epigenetic status of genes through acetylation of both histones and transcription factors. Deregulation of HATs and HDACs is frequently seen in various cancers, including prostate cancer. Many cellular oncogenes as well as tumor viral proteins are known to target either or both HATs and HDACs. Several studies have demonstrated that there are alterations of HDAC activity in prostate cancer cells. Recently, we found that ERG binds and inhibits HATs, which suggests that ERG is involved in deregulation of protein acetylation. Additionally, it has been shown that ERG is associated with a higher expression of HDACs. In this study, we tested the effect of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and trichostatin-A (TSA) on ERG-positive prostate cancer cells (VCaP). We found that VPA and TSA induce apoptosis, upregulate p21/Waf1/CIP1, repress TMPRSS2-ERG expression and affect acetylation status of p53 in VCaP cells. These results suggest that HDAC inhibitors might restore HAT activity through two different ways: by inhibiting HDAC activity and by repressing HAT targeting oncoproteins such as ERG.","['Fortson, Wendell S', 'Kayarthodi, Shubhalaxmi', 'Fujimura, Yasuo', 'Xu, Huali', 'Matthews, Roland', 'Grizzle, William E', 'Rao, Veena N', 'Bhat, Ganapathy K', 'Reddy, E Shyam P']","['Fortson WS', 'Kayarthodi S', 'Fujimura Y', 'Xu H', 'Matthews R', 'Grizzle WE', 'Rao VN', 'Bhat GK', 'Reddy ES']","['Cancer Biology Program, Department of OB/GYN, Morehouse School of Medicine, Georgia Cancer Center for Excellence, Grady Health System, 80 Jessie Hill Jr. Drive, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1014 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Jul;39(1):111-9. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1014.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) possesses a role in this apoptotic block, although underlying functional mechanisms and the involvement of the microenvironment are unclear. In this study, the VEGF status in CLL was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) phosphorylation was determined flow cytometrically and by immunofluorescence. For co-culture, CLL cells were cultivated on a monolayer of the bone marrow-derived stromal cell (BMSC) line HS5. Secreted VEGF was neutralized using the monoclonal antibody mAb293 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To block protein secretion, we used Brefeldin A. VEGF was downregulated in BMSCs by small interfering RNA (siRNA), and we assessed survival by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining. CLL cells express and secrete VEGF and possess phosphorylated VEGFR2. This positive VEGF status is not sufficient to prevent spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. Coculture with BMSCs, which secrete vast amounts of VEGF, maintains in vitro CLL cell survival. Blockage of secreted VEGF using the monoclonal antibody mAb293 significantly reduced the survival support for cocultured CLL cells. Both general blockage of protein secretion by Brefeldin A in BMSCs, but not in CLL cells, and siRNA-mediated downregulation of VEGF in BMSCs, significantly reduced the coculture-mediated survival support for CLL cells. It can be concluded that BMSC-derived proteins and VEGF, in particular, but not CLL cell-derived VEGF, is essentially involved in the coculture-mediated survival support for CLL cells. Hence, therapeutic targeting of VEGF signaling might be a promising approach to overcome the apoptotic resistance CLL cells feature within their natural microenvironment.","['Gehrke, Iris', 'Gandhirajan, Rajesh Kumar', 'Poll-Wolbeck, Simon Jonas', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Gehrke I', 'Gandhirajan RK', 'Poll-Wolbeck SJ', 'Hallek M', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2010.00210 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2010.00210 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2011;17(7-8):619-27. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2010.00210.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several new studies have broadened our understanding of how aberrations of the miRNome contribute to the development of a malignant lymphoid phenotype. Recently, a new pathogenetic model involving miRNAs and protein coding genes (such as TP53 and ZAP-70) has been identified and explains the prognostic implications of the most recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, new recent studies have addressed the role of miRNAs in human lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemias. SUMMARY: The recent advances in our understanding of the role of miRNAs in lymphoid malignancies demonstrate that miRNAs can effectively be used as tumoral biomarkers with implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy.","['Fabbri, Muller', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Fabbri M', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283476012 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Jul;18(4):266-72. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283476012.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283476012 [doi],,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism']",['U01 CA152758/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3400499,,,,['NIHMS313356'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IPSS gives more weight to blast count than to cytogenetics. However, previous publications suggested that cytogenetics are underweighted in the IPSS. Here we investigate the prognostic impact of cytogenetic subgroups compared with that of bone marrow blast count in a large, multicentric, international patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 2,351 patients with MDS who have records in the German-Austrian and the MD Anderson Cancer Center databases were included and analyzed in univariate and multivariate models regarding overall survival and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The data were analyzed separately for patients treated with supportive care without specific therapy, with AML-like chemotherapy, or with other therapy regimens (low-dose chemotherapy, demethylating agents, immune modulating agents, valproic acid, and cyclosporine). RESULTS: The prognostic impact of poor-risk cytogenetic findings (as defined by the IPSS classification) on overall survival was as unfavorable as an increased (> 20%) blast count. The hazard ratio (compared with an abnormal karyotype or a bone marrow blast count < 5%) was 3.3 for poor-risk cytogenetics, 4.8 for complex abnormalities harboring chromosomes 5 and/or 7, and 3.1 for a blast count of 21% to 30% (P < .01 for all categories). The predictive power of the IPSS cytogenetic subgroups was unaffected by type of therapy given. CONCLUSION: The independent prognostic impact of poor-risk cytogenetics on overall survival is equivalent to the impact of high blast counts. This finding should be considered in the upcoming revision of the IPSS.","['Schanz, Julie', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Nosslinger, Thomas', 'Tuechler, Heinz', 'Valent, Peter', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Krieger, Otto', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Schanz J', 'Steidl C', 'Fonatsch C', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Nosslinger T', 'Tuechler H', 'Valent P', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Giagounidis A', 'Aul C', 'Lubbert M', 'Stauder R', 'Krieger O', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Germing U', 'Haase D', 'Estey E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University, Robert-Koch-Str 40, 37075 Goettingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.3978 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.3978 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 May 20;29(15):1963-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.3978.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre- and postprogression bone marrow (BM) samples from 55 consecutive patients with International Prognostic Scoring System low risk (n = 32) or intermediate-1 risk (n = 23) were studied by next-generation sequencing of TP53. IHC for p53 was performed on 148 sequential BM samples. RESULTS: TP53 mutations with a median clone size of 11% (range, 1% to 54%) were detected in 10 patients (18%) already at an early phase of the disease. Mutations were equally common in low-risk and intermediate-1-risk patients and were associated with evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (5 of 10 v 7 of 45; P = .045). Nine of 10 patients carrying mutations showed more than 2% BM progenitors with strong p53 staining. The probability of a complete cytogenetic response to lenalidomide was lower in mutated patients (0 of 7 v 12 of 24; P = .024). CONCLUSION: By using sensitive deep-sequencing technology, we demonstrated that TP53 mutated populations may occur at an early disease stage in almost a fifth of low-risk MDS patients with del(5q). Importantly, mutations were present years before disease progression and were associated with an increased risk of leukemic evolution. TP53 mutations could not be predicted by common clinical features but were associated with p53 overexpression. Our findings indicate a previously unrecognized heterogeneity of the disease which may significantly affect clinical decision making.","['Jadersten, Martin', 'Saft, Leonie', 'Smith, Alexander', 'Kulasekararaj, Austin', 'Pomplun, Sabine', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Hedlund, Anette', 'Hast, Robert', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Jadersten M', 'Saft L', 'Smith A', 'Kulasekararaj A', 'Pomplun S', 'Gohring G', 'Hedlund A', 'Hast R', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Porwit A', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Mufti GJ']","['Center for Experimental Hematology M54, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden. eva.hellstrom-lindberg@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.31.8576 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.31.8576 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 May 20;29(15):1971-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.31.8576.

IL-2 monotherapy has been evaluated in several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for remission maintenance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1), and none demonstrated a significant benefit of IL-2 monotherapy. The objective of this meta-analysis was to reliably determine IL-2 efficacy by combining all available individual patient data (IPD) from 5 RCTs (N = 905) and summary data from a sixth RCT (N = 550). Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression models stratified by trial, with HR < 1 indicating treatment benefit. Combined IPD showed no benefit of IL-2 over no treatment in terms of leukemia-free survival (HR = 0.97; P = .74) or overall survival (HR = 1.08; P = .39). Analyses including the sixth RCT yielded qualitatively identical results (leukemia-free survival HR = 0.96, P = .52; overall survival HR = 1.06; P = .46). No significant heterogeneity was found between the trials. Prespecified subset analyses showed no interaction between the lack of IL-2 effect and any factor, including age, sex, baseline performance status, karyotype, AML subtype, and time from achievement of CR1 to initiation of maintenance therapy.

Disruption of cooperative gene activation could contribute to aberrant repression of differentiation genes and leukemogenesis initiated by mutations and translocations of RUNX1. To investigate the mechanisms underlying cooperative gene activation, the effects of Runx1 deficiency were examined in an in vitro model of Pu.1-driven macrophage differentiation and in primary cells. Runx1 deficiency decreased Pu.1-mediated activation of Mcsfr and Gmcsfr, accompanied by decreased histone acetylation at the Mcsfr and Gmcsfr promoters, and increased endogenous corepressor (Eto2, Sin3A, and Hdac2) coimmunoprecipitation with Pu.1. In cotransfection experiments, corepressors were excluded from a multiprotein complex containing full-length RUNX1 and PU.1. However, corepressors interacted with PU.1 if wild-type RUNX1 was replaced with truncated variants associated with leukemia. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme activity is a major component of corepressor function. HDAC inhibition using suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or MS-275 significantly increased MCSFR and GMCSFR expression in leukemia cell lines that express PU.1 and mutated or translocated RUNX1. RUNX1 deficiency is associated with persistent corepressor interaction with PU.1.

Oncogene-dependent DNA damage and activation of the ARF/p53 pathway play a central role in OIS and, accordingly, ARF and p53 are frequently mutated in human cancer. A number of leukemia/lymphoma-initiating oncogenes, however, inhibit ARF/p53 and only infrequently select for ARF or p53 mutations, suggesting the involvement of other tumor-suppressive pathways. We report that NPM-ALK, the initiating oncogene of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), induces DNA damage and irreversibly arrests the cell cycle of primary fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors. This effect is associated with inhibition of p53 and is caused by activation of the p16INK4a/pRb tumor-suppressive pathway. Analysis of NPM-ALK lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice showed p16INK4a-dependent accumulation of senescent cells in premalignant lesions and decreased tumor latency in the absence of p16INK4a. Accordingly, human ALCLs showed no expression of either p16INK4a or pRb. Up-regulation of the histone-demethylase Jmjd3 and de-methylation at the p16INK4a promoter contributed to the effect of NPM-ALK on p16INK4a, which was transcriptionally regulated. These data demonstrate that p16INK4a/pRb may function as an alternative pathway of oncogene-induced senescence, and suggest that the reactivation of p16INK4a expression might be a novel strategy to restore the senescence program in some tumors.","['Martinelli, Paola', 'Bonetti, Paola', 'Sironi, Cristina', 'Pruneri, Giancarlo', 'Fumagalli, Caterina', 'Raviele, Paola Rafaniello', 'Volorio, Sara', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Chiarle, Roberto', 'McDuff, Fiona Kate Elizabeth', 'Tusi, Betsabeh Khoramian', 'Turner, Suzanne D', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Colombo, Emanuela']","['Martinelli P', 'Bonetti P', 'Sironi C', 'Pruneri G', 'Fumagalli C', 'Raviele PR', 'Volorio S', 'Pileri S', 'Chiarle R', 'McDuff FK', 'Tusi BK', 'Turner SD', 'Inghirami G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Colombo E']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Via Adamello 16, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/09/03 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44924-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-301135 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 16;117(24):6617-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-301135.

However, it remains unclear what portion of the leukemic genome is under the direct control of MLL fusions. By comparing patient-derived leukemic cell lines, we find that MLL fusion-bound genes are a small subset of that recognized by wild-type MLL. In an inducible MLL-ENL model, MLL fusion protein binding and changes in H3K79 methylation are limited to a specific portion of the genome, whereas wild-type MLL distributes to a much larger set of gene loci. Surprisingly, among 223 MLL-ENL-bound genes, only 12 demonstrate a significant increase in mRNA expression on induction of the fusion protein. In addition to Hoxa9 and Meis1, this includes Eya1 and Six1, which comprise a heterodimeric transcription factor important in several developmental pathways. We show that Eya1 has the capacity to immortalize hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro and collaborates with Six1 in hematopoietic transformation assays.

The rearrangements underlie the generation of MLL fusion proteins acting as potent oncogenes. Several most consistently up-regulated targets of MLL fusions, MEIS1, HOXA7, HOXA9, and HOXA10 are functionally related and have been implicated in other types of leukemias. Each of the four genes was knocked down separately in the human precursor B-cell leukemic line RS4;11 expressing MLL-AF4. The mutant and control cells were compared for engraftment in NOD/SCID mice. Engraftment of all mutants into the bone marrow (BM) was impaired. Although homing was similar, colonization by the knockdown cells was slowed. Initially, both types of cells were confined to the trabecular area; this was followed by a rapid spread of the WT cells to the compact bone area, contrasted with a significantly slower process for the mutants. In vitro and in vivo BrdU incorporation experiments indicated reduced proliferation of the mutant cells. In addition, the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis was hampered, as evidenced by reduced migration toward an SDF-1 gradient and loss of SDF-1-augmented proliferation in culture. The very similar phenotype shared by all mutant lines implies that all four genes are involved and required for expansion of MLL-AF4 associated leukemic cells in mice, and down-regulation of any of them is not compensated by the others.","['Orlovsky, Kira', 'Kalinkovich, Alexander', 'Rozovskaia, Tanya', 'Shezen, Elias', 'Itkin, Tomer', 'Alder, Hansjuerg', 'Ozer, Hatice Gulcin', 'Carramusa, Letizia', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Buchberg, Arthur', 'Mazo, Alex', 'Kollet, Orit', 'Largman, Corey', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Lapidot, Tsvee', 'Canaani, Eli']","['Orlovsky K', 'Kalinkovich A', 'Rozovskaia T', 'Shezen E', 'Itkin T', 'Alder H', 'Ozer HG', 'Carramusa L', 'Avigdor A', 'Volinia S', 'Buchberg A', 'Mazo A', 'Kollet O', 'Largman C', 'Croce CM', 'Nakamura T', 'Lapidot T', 'Canaani E']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1103154108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1103154108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 May 10;108(19):7956-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1103154108.

Previously, we observed a link between B7-H3 and tumor cell migration and invasion, and in present study, we have investigated the role of B7-H3 in chemoresistance in breast cancer. We observed that silencing of B7-H3, via stable short hairpin RNA or transient short interfering RNA transfection, increased the sensitivity of multiple human breast cancer cell lines to paclitaxel as a result of enhanced drug-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of B7-H3 made the cancer cells more resistant to the drug. Next, we investigated the mechanisms behind B7-H3-mediated paclitaxel resistance and found that the level of Stat3 Tyr705 phosphorylation was decreased in B7-H3 knockdown cells along with the expression of its direct downstream targets Mcl-1 and survivin. The phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), an upstream molecule of Stat3, was also significantly decreased. In contrast, reexpression of B7-H3 in B7-H3 knockdown and low B7-H3 expressing cells increased the phosphorylation of Jak2 and Stat3. In vivo animal experiments showed that B7-H3 knockdown tumors displayed a slower growth rate than the control xenografts. Importantly, paclitaxel treatment showed a strong antitumor activity in the mice with B7-H3 knockdown tumors, but only a marginal effect in the control group. Taken together, our data show that in breast cancer cells, B7-H3 induces paclitaxel resistance, at least partially by interfering with Jak2/Stat3 pathway. These results provide novel insight into the function of B7-H3 and encourage the design and testing of approaches targeting this protein and its partners.","['Liu, Hao', 'Tekle, Christina', 'Chen, Yih-Wen', 'Kristian, Alexandr', 'Zhao, Yuhua', 'Zhou, Ming', 'Liu, Zixing', 'Ding, Yan', 'Wang, Bin', 'Maelandsmo, Gunhild Mari', 'Nesland, Jahn Marthin', 'Fodstad, Oystein', 'Tan, Ming']","['Liu H', 'Tekle C', 'Chen YW', 'Kristian A', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou M', 'Liu Z', 'Ding Y', 'Wang B', 'Maelandsmo GM', 'Nesland JM', 'Fodstad O', 'Tan M']","['Mitchell Cancer Institute, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama 36604, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0072 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0072 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Jun;10(6):960-71. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0072.

METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews with parents of children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were conducted. Parents were sampled from 6 UK treatment centers. Analysis was informed by the constant comparative method and content analysis. RESULTS: We report on interviews with 53 parents (33 mothers, 20 fathers). Parents acknowledged the benefits of communicating openly with children, but few thought that their child's presence in discussions was straightforwardly desirable. They described how their child's presence restricted their own communication with physicians, made concentrating difficult, and interfered with their efforts to care for their child emotionally. Children's presence was particularly difficult when significant issues were being discussed, including prognoses, adverse results, and certain medical procedures. Parents felt that such discussions posed a potential threat to their child, particularly when they had not first had an opportunity to discuss information with the physician separately from the child. In contrast, separate meetings enabled parents to absorb information and to convey it to their child at an appropriate time and in a reassuring way. Some parents experienced difficulties in accessing separate meetings with physicians. CONCLUSIONS: The difficulties parents described could potentially be addressed by extending, beyond the diagnosis period, the practice of sequencing significant information so that it is communicated to parents in separate meetings before being communicated to the child and by periodically exploring with parents what information would be in each child's interests.","['Young, Bridget', 'Ward, Joanne', 'Salmon, Peter', 'Gravenhorst, Katja', 'Hill, Jonathan', 'Eden, Tim']","['Young B', 'Ward J', 'Salmon P', 'Gravenhorst K', 'Hill J', 'Eden T']","['Institute of Psychology, Health and Society, University of Liverpool, Whelan Building, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, United Kingdom. byoung@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/07/12 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2010-2402 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2010-2402 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2011 May;127(5):e1230-8. doi: 10.1542/peds.2010-2402.

The recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids including YB-1 shRNA and the vector-random-sequence were introduced into K562/A02 cells by lipofectamine mediation, and the positive clones were screened by G418. RT-PCR and Western blot were employed to detect the expression of mRNA and protein of YB-1 in leukemia cells, respectively. The proliferative ability of the cells was determined by MTT assay and cell cycle analysis. Apoptosis of K562/A02 cells was assayed by AnnexinV-FITC/PI double labeled flow cytometry. The drug sensitivity to anticancer agent was determined by MTT assay. The expressions of MDR1 gene and P-gp were detected by RT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively. The results indicated that the levels of mRNA and protein of YB-1 decreased dramatically in three groups of positively transfected cells when compared with control cells. The inhibitory rates of 3 different shRNA sequences targeting YB-1 gene were (65.1 +/- 2.1)%, (27.4 +/- 1.3)% and (67.4 +/- 1.6)% respectively. The introduction of exogenous YB-1 shRNA gene into K562/A02 cells resulted in decreased levels of the proliferative ability in K562/A02 cells, and displayed higher at G(1), lower at G(2) and S phase in cell cycle distribution in comparison with the control groups.

This study was purposed to explore the effect of desferrioxamine (DFO) on cell line K562/A02 and its mechanism. K562/A02 cells were cultured with different concentrations of DFO. The inhibitory effects of adriamycin (ADM) used alone or combined with DFO on the proliferation of K562/A02 was evaluated by MTT assay. The apoptosis rate of K562/A02 cells after treatment with 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 micromol/L DFO alone or in combination with 1 mg/L ADM were analyzed by flow cytometry. ADM accumulation in K562/A02 cells after treatment with different concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 micromol/L DFO were also analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of BAX/BCL-2 and MDR1 mRNA were determined by RT-PCR, and then the protein level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was detected by Western blot. The results showed that the IC(50) of ADM for K562 and K562/A02 cells were (1.46 +/- 0.07) mg/L and (40.98 +/- 3.05) mg/L respectively. The resistance of K562/A02 cells to ADM was 28.06 times as that of K562 cells. After treatment of K562/A02 cell with DFO of 12.5, 25 and 50 micromol/L for 48 hours, the resistance of K562/A02 cells to ADM were increased by 24.95, 16.11 and 9.99 times respectively. When K562/A02 cells were incubated with different concentrations of DFO of 12.5, 25, 50 micromol/L for 48 hours, the apoptosis rat were (3.50 +/- 0.30)%, (7.27 +/- 0.32)% and (12.53 +/- 1.21)% respectively. After co-culture with DFO and ADM for 48 hours, apoptosis rate were (6.13 +/- 0.29)%, (9.57 +/- 0.40)% and (18.97 +/- 1.10)% respectively. The above apoptosis rates was much higher than that of control group (p < 0.05) and they were dose-dependent. In comparison between DFO + ADM group and DFO group, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). Expression rate of BAX/BCL-2 increased. The levels of MDR1 mRNA reduced. Furthermore, expression of P-gp also decreased in K562/A02 cells. It is concluded that iron increase can promote K562/A02 cells growth and inhibit their apoptosis. Otherwise, iron-deprivation can induce K562/A02 cells apoptosis. DFO disturbs the iron metabolism and inhibits DNA synthesis of K562/A02 cells. This action of DFO may enhance the susceptibility of K562/A02 cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. The iron-deprivation may play a role in the treatment of leukemia with combination of DFO with other anticancer agents.","['Cheng, Jian', 'Wang, Ting', 'Chen, Bao-An', 'Ding, Jia-Hua', 'Gao, Chong', 'Xia, Guo-Hua', 'Bao, Wen', 'Song, Hui-Hui', 'Xu, Wen-Lin', 'Shen, Hui-Ling']","['Cheng J', 'Wang T', 'Chen BA', 'Ding JH', 'Gao C', 'Xia GH', 'Bao W', 'Song HH', 'Xu WL', 'Shen HL']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical College, Nanjing, Jiangso Province, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,2011/04/27 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)02-0337-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Apr;19(2):337-41.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up-regulated miRNA in K562 cells after 5-aza treatment was screened by microarray. The up-regulated miR-638, miR-663 and miR-92b with CpG islands in upstream region were screened by microarray in combination with bioinformatics. The miRNA mentioned above was further ascertained by SYBR-green real-time PCR. Up-regulated miR-663 was confirmed by real-time PCR. Expression level of miR-663 was detected in K562, U937 and Kasumi cell lines, and white blood cells from bone marrow of normal donor and from peripheral blood of newly diagnosed CML patient. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was applied to analyze the methylated status of miR-663 CpG island in K562 cells. Proliferation of K562 cells was observed after miR-663 was over expressed by transient transfection. The results showed that the expression level of miR-663 in K562 cells was up-regulated after 5-aza treatment, and the expressions of miR-663 were lower in K562, U937, Kasumi cell lines and newly diagnosed patients, compared with healthy people. The CpG island of miR-663 was methylated in K562 cell line according to detection result of MSP. The proliferation of K562 cell could be suppressed by over-expression of miR-663 in vitro. It is concluded that miR-663 CpG island is methylated in K562 cell line. The miR-663 is down-regulated in K562, U937, Kasumi cell lines and CML patients, compared with healthy people. miRNA-663 in K562 cells is up-regulated after 5-aza treatment. Over-expression of miR-663 can suppress the proliferation of K562 cells, which suggests that miR-663 may possesses suppressive effect for leukaemia.","['Yang, Yang', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Li, Yong-Hui', 'Gao, Xiao-Ning', 'Yu, Li']","['Yang Y', 'Wang LL', 'Li YH', 'Gao XN', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,2011/04/27 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)02-0279-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Apr;19(2):279-83.,,,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using bioinformatics and in vitro experiments, we identified the microRNA gene expression profile of HL-60 cells during ATRA induced granulocytic differentiation. RESULTS: Six microRNAs were upregulated by ATRA treatment, miR-663, miR-494, miR-145, miR-22, miR-363* and miR-223; and three microRNAs were downregulated, miR-10a, miR-181 and miR-612. Additionally, miR-663 expression was regulated by ATRA. We used a lentivirus (LV) backbone incorporating the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV-F) promoter to drive miR-663 expression, as the CMV (Cytomegalovirus) promoter is ineffective in some lymphocyte cells. Transfection of LV-miR-663 induced significant HL-60 cell differentiation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show miR-663 may play an important role in ATRA induced HL-60 cell differentiation. Lentivirus delivery of miR-663 could potentially be used directly as an anticancer treatment in hematological malignancies.","['Jian, Pan', 'Li, Zhao Wen', 'Fang, Tao Yan', 'Jian, Wang', 'Zhuan, Zhou', 'Mei, Liao Xin', 'Yan, Wu Shui', 'Jian, Ni']","['Jian P', 'Li ZW', 'Fang TY', 'Jian W', 'Zhuan Z', 'Mei LX', 'Yan WS', 'Jian N']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-4-20 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-4-20 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2011 Apr 25;4:20. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-4-20.,10.1186/1756-8722-4-20 [doi],20110425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN663 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,PMC3094392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to other members of the Pim family (i.e. Pim-1 and Pim-2), Pim-3 can prevent apoptosis and promote cell survival and protein translation, thereby enhancing cell proliferation of normal and malignant cells. Pim-3 is expressed in vital organs, such as the heart, lung, and brain. However, minimal phenotypic changes in Pim-3-deficient mice suggest that Pim-3 may be physiologically dispensable. Pim-3 expression is enhanced in several cancer tissues, particularly those of endoderm-derived organs, including the liver, pancreas, colon, and stomach. The development of hepatocellular carcinoma is accelerated in mice expressing the Pim-3 gene selectively in the liver only when these mice are treated with a hepatocarcinogen, indicating that Pim-3 can act as a promoter but not as an initiator. Moreover, inhibition of Pim-3 expression can retard in vitro cell proliferation of hepatocellular, pancreatic, and colon carcinoma cell lines by promoting cell apoptosis. Furthermore, a Pim-3 kinase inhibitor has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation in an in vivo xenograft model using a human pancreatic cancer cell line without inducing any major adverse effects. Thus, Pim-3 kinase may be a candidate molecule for the development of molecular targeting drugs against cancer.","['Mukaida, Naofumi', 'Wang, Ying-Ying', 'Li, Ying-Yi']","['Mukaida N', 'Wang YY', 'Li YY']","['Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Microenvironment Research Program, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan. naofumim@kenroku.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01966.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Aug;102(8):1437-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01966.x.

Several polymorphisms have been identified in the promoter region of the MKK4 gene and we hypothesized that genetic variations in this region may alter gene expression, and thus cancer risk. In the present study, we genotyped two polymorphisms in the promoter of the MKK4 gene, namely -1304T>G (rs3826392) and -1044A>T (rs3809728), in 433 patients with AML and 600 controls, and assessed the association between those polymorphisms and the risk of AML. Compared with the -1304TT genotype, patients with the -1304TG genotype had a significantly decreased risk of AML (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.87), with the risk decreased even further in those carrying -1304GG (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.31-0.97). Additional experiments, which focused on reporter gene expression driven by MKK4 promoters, demonstrated that the presence of a -1304G allele led to greater transcriptional activity than the presence of a -1304T allele. However, no significant association was observed between the MKK4-1044A>T polymorphism and the risk of AML. These findings suggest that the functional -1304G>T variant may contribute to the risk of AML by enhancing the transcriptional activity of MKK4. Thus, this polymorphism may be a genetic modifier for the development of AML.","['Jiang, Lan', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Sun, Aining', 'Zheng, Jian', 'Liu, Bin', 'You, Yonghe', 'Zhang, Chun', 'Wu, Depei', 'Zhou, Yifeng']","['Jiang L', 'Zhou P', 'Sun A', 'Zheng J', 'Liu B', 'You Y', 'Zhang C', 'Wu D', 'Zhou Y']","['Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics, Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01965.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Aug;102(8):1462-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01965.x.

Although most guidelines recommend preprocedural platelet (PLT) transfusions at a threshold of less than 50 x 10(9) /L, there is only weak evidence supporting such recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The current study aimed to establish a safe PLT transfusion trigger in patients with CVC placements. We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of 604 CVC insertions in 193 patients with acute leukemia receiving intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: A total of 48% of the patients had a bleeding risk during CVC insertions, mostly due to thrombocytopenia. The bleeding incidence was 32% with 96% Grade 1 and 4% Grade 2 bleedings requiring prolonged local compression. There were no Grade 3 to 4 bleedings. Hemoglobin levels were similar before and 24 and 48 hours after the CVC insertion in the bleeding and nonbleeding group and there was no difference in the red blood cell (p = 0.72) and PLT transfusion requirements (p = 0.057) after CVC insertion. In multivariate analysis, only patients with PLT counts of less than 20 x 10(9) /L were at higher risk for bleeding before (p = 0.015) and after preprocedural PLT transfusions (p =0.006) compared to patients with PLT counts of 100 x 10(9) /L or more. CONCLUSION: CVC placements can safely be performed in patients with PLT counts of 20 x 10(9) /L or more without preprocedural PLT transfusions.","['Zeidler, Kristin', 'Arn, Kornelius', 'Senn, Oliver', 'Schanz, Urs', 'Stussi, Georg']","['Zeidler K', 'Arn K', 'Senn O', 'Schanz U', 'Stussi G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Munsterlingen, Munsterlingen, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03147.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2011 Nov;51(11):2269-76. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03147.x.

The resistance of B-lineage ALL cells to the standard anti-leukaemic drug vincristine was overcome by the HSPA5 inhibitor epigallocatechin gallate, which inhibits the anti-apoptotic function of HSPA5 by targeting its ATP-binding domain. Notably, chemotherapy-resistant B-lineage ALL cells underwent apoptosis within 48 h of exposure to a doxorubicin-conjugated cell-penetrating cyclic anti-HSPA5 peptide targeting surface-expressed HSPA5 molecules on leukaemia cells. The identification of the HSPA5 as a chemoresistance biomarker and molecular target for B-lineage ALL may lead to new anti-leukaemic treatment strategies that are much needed.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Ozer, Zahide', 'Garner, Amanda L', 'Pitt, Jason', 'Ma, Hong', 'Janda, Kim D']","['Uckun FM', 'Qazi S', 'Ozer Z', 'Garner AL', 'Pitt J', 'Ma H', 'Janda KD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA. fmuckun@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2011/04/27 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08671.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jun;153(6):741-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08671.x.

Since reports on cancer FH from developing countries are limited, the present study was conducted to provide a first report on the prevalence of familial cancers in Iran. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis performed on self-reported FH of cancers based on data from a large population based study in Tehran, the capital of Iran. Each participant was shown a list of site-specific cancers and asked if a relative had been diagnosed with any cancer on the list, completing the question by specifying the age of diagnosis. RESULTS: Stomach cancer (4.6%) was the most common condition noted for family members, followed by the cancers of the breast (4.2%), lung (3.5%), liver (3.1%), leukemia (3.0) and colorectum (2.8%). The most frequent cancer reported by the responders was breast (1.8%) in first degree relatives (FDR) and stomach (1.8%) and stomach (2.8%) in second degree relatives (SDR). A FH of cancer was more commonly reported by younger persons and females. Of all respondents with a positive FH, 28.2% had at least one affected person diagnosed at age under 50 years in their FDRs. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of individuals in the Iran report having a family member affected by cancer, and thus may be recommended for early cancer screening services.","['Moghimi-Dehkordi, Bijan', 'Safaee, Azadeh', 'Vahedi, Mohsen', 'Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin', 'Pourhoseingholi, Asma', 'Habibi, Manijeh', 'Zali, Mohammad Reza']","['Moghimi-Dehkordi B', 'Safaee A', 'Vahedi M', 'Pourhoseingholi MA', 'Pourhoseingholi A', 'Habibi M', 'Zali MR']","['Research Center for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,2011/04/27 06:00,2012/05/31 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(1):289-95.,,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Family Health', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven donor volunteers and 39 patients with different forms with AL at various stages of polychemotherapy (PCT) were examined. Cytostatic therapy was accompanied by 51Cr-labeled platelet concentrate (PC) transfusions. The patients were on appropriate high-dose (HD) PCT. RESULTS: The duration of donor platelet circulation was 8-10 days in healthy individuals. No platelet hypersequestration was recorded in both the spleen and the liver. Donor platelet survival was shorter in all patients with in a state of cytostatic cytopenia. There was an inverse correlation between the degree of circulation shortening and some clinical and hematological parameters (the bone marrow level of blastemia and blastosis, the XIIa-dependent fibrinolysis parameters). Four variants of radioactivity trends above the spleen and liver were identified. The findings suggest that there is platelet hypersequestration in the spleen, liver, and both organs. In some patients, the above both organs are uninvolved in the hypersequestration processes and the possible mechanism for increased consumption of transfused donor platelets, which is associated with recovery of the HD PCT-damaged vascular endothelium is considered. CONCLUSION: Shortening of transfused donor platelet circulation was found in relation to the level of blastosis. The described procedure may be used as one of the additional methods for evaluating the efficacy of donor PC transfusion and for specifying the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenias in AL patients on programmed HD PCT. A procedure is proposed to time the circulation of 51Cr-labeled platelets, by assessing deposit phenomena and estimating the level of their sequestration in the spleen and liver for the prediction of the efficiency of TC transfusions.","['Migunova, E V', 'Sakhibov, Ia D', 'Ryzhko, V V', 'Sorokina, O M', 'Sagdieva, N Sh', 'Gemdzhian, E G']","['Migunova EV', 'Sakhibov IaD', 'Ryzhko VV', 'Sorokina OM', 'Sagdieva NSh', 'Gemdzhian EG']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,2010/01/01 00:00,2011/06/24 06:00,['2011/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2010;82(12):51-6.,,,,IM,"['Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Mutations of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TDK, and the NPM1 gene were found in 16 (37.2%) patients. A total of 19 mutations were revealed. There were 8 mutations of FLT3-ITD, 5 of FLT3-TKD, and 6 in the NPM1 gene. Single damages to genes were detected in 13 patients: FLT3-ITD in 6 (13.9%), FLT3-TKD in 4 (9.3%), and NPM1 in 3 (7%).

The first leukemia-lymphoma cell lines were established in 1963 and since then large numbers of new cell lines have been described. The major advantages of continuous leukemia-lymphoma cell lines are the unlimited supply and worldwide availability of identical cell material and the infinite viable storability in liquid nitrogen. These cell lines are characterized generally by monoclonal origin and differentiation arrest, sustained proliferation in vitro under preservation of most cellular features, and by specific genetic alterations. Here some of the more promising techniques for establishing new leukemia-lymphoma cell lines and the basic principles for culturing these cells are described. Several clinical and cell culture parameters might have some influence on the success rate, e.g., choice of culture medium and culture conditions, specimen site of the primary cells, and status of the patient at the time of sample collection.","['Drexler, Hans G']",['Drexler HG'],"['DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany. hdr@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61779-080-5_16 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2011;731:181-200. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-080-5_16.,10.1007/978-1-61779-080-5_16 [doi],,['N762921K75 (Nitrogen)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*pathology', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cryopreservation', 'Documentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Nitrogen/chemistry', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unknown how signals from cellular metabolism can affect the balance between Mcl-1 and Noxa and to what extent other Bcl-2 members are involved in this apoptosis cascade. Here, we defined the mechanism underlying apoptosis in relation to various types of metabolic stress. First, we established that the Noxa/Mcl-1 balance is regulated by glucose deprivation as well as by general metabolic stress, via changes in proteasome-mediated degradation of Mcl-1. Second, in contrast with cytokine-deprivation, no transcriptional modulation of Mcl-1, Puma, Bim or Noxa was observed during glucose deprivation. Third, no changes in PKB or GSK3 activity occurred and no clear role for AMPK was detected. Fourth, apoptosis triggered by nutrient deprivation was executed without signs of overt autophagy and independent of ROS production or p38 MAP kinase activity. Lastly, apoptosis under nutrient limitation could also be delayed by knock-down of Bim or overexpression of Bcl-2. In conclusion, Noxa functions in a specific apoptotic pathway that integrates overall nutrient stress, independent from attenuated PI3K/PKB signaling and without clear involvement of autophagy.","['Wensveen, Felix M', 'Alves, Nuno L', 'Derks, Ingrid A M', 'Reedquist, Kris A', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Wensveen FM', 'Alves NL', 'Derks IA', 'Reedquist KA', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0599-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2011 Jul;16(7):708-21. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0599-8.,10.1007/s10495-011-0599-8 [doi],,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.3 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glucose/deficiency', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyruvic Acid/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Stress, Physiological/drug effects']",,PMC3098366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated whether the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) could reduce the level of residual disease in patients with Ph-positive CML who appeared to have achieved a suboptimal response to imatinib alone. METHODS: Eleven patients with CML who had achieved >/=35% Ph-negativity on imatinib were enrolled. The starting dose of imatinib was 400 mg or 600 mg orally daily, and of G-CSF 5 microg/kg s.c. daily. The administration of G-CSF was postponed or interrupted in the event of leukocytosis (>/=30 x10(9) leukocytes/l) until the white blood cell count fell below 20 x 10(9)/l. Efficacy was assessed by serial monitoring of blood levels of BCR-ABL transcripts. RESULTS: Of 11 evaluable patients, 9 had an appreciable decline in BCR-ABL transcript levels; in 7 cases the reduction was greater than 1 log. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the addition of G-CSF should be considered for patients on imatinib who fail to obtain optimal response to imatinib alone and that this approach deserves further evaluation as frontline therapy for newly diagnosed CML.","['Fang, Baijun', 'Mai, Ling', 'Li, Ning', 'Song, Yongping', 'Chunhua Zhao, Robert']","['Fang B', 'Mai L', 'Li N', 'Song Y', 'Chunhua Zhao R']","['Henan Institute of Hematology, Henan Tumor Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/04/26 06:01,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000327512 [doi]', '000327512 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2011 Apr 2;4(1):192-7. doi: 10.1159/000327512.,10.1159/000327512 [doi],20110402,,,,,PMC3080784,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor', 'Imatinib']",,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to design and synthesize novel cholic acid-cytarabine conjugates to improve its pharmacokinetic parameters. METHODS: The in vitro stability of novel cholic acid-cytarabine conjugates was investigated in simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, mouse blood and liver homogenate using HPLC. The portacaval samples of the conjugates were examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats using LC/MS, and in vivo distribution was examined in male Kunming mice using LC/MS. Antitumor activities were tested in HL60 cells using MTT assay. RESULTS: Cholic acid-cytarabine compounds with four different linkers were designed and synthesized. All the four cholic acid-cytarabine conjugates could release cytarabine when incubated with the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, mouse blood and liver homogenate. The conjugates 6, 12, and 16 were present in the portacaval samples, whereas the conjugate 7 was not detected. The conjugates 6 and 16 showed high specificity in targeting the liver (liver target index 34.9 and 16.3, respectively) and good absorption in vivo, as compared with cytarabine. In cytarabine-sensitive HL60 cells, the conjugates 6, 12, and 16 retained potent antitumor activities. CONCLUSION: Three novel cholic acid-cytarabine conjugates with good liver-targeting properties and absorption were obtained. Further optimization of the conjugates is needed in the future.","['Chen, Dan-qi', 'Wang, Xin', 'Chen, Lin', 'He, Jin-xue', 'Miao, Ze-hong', 'Shen, Jing-kang']","['Chen DQ', 'Wang X', 'Chen L', 'He JX', 'Miao ZH', 'Shen JK']","['State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/09/03 06:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['aps20117 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2011.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2011 May;32(5):664-72. doi: 10.1038/aps.2011.7.

The short form of MEL1 (MEL1S), which lacks the PR-domain at the N-terminus, is the main form expressed in t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive acute myeloid leukemia cells. The overexpression of MEL1S blocks granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced myeloid differentiation in interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid L-G3 cells. In this study, we show that treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A abolished the blockade of myeloid differentiation in L-G3 cells overexpressing MEL1S. The expression of MEL1S containing mutated CtBP-interacting motif (CIM) in L-G3 cells still blocked the myeloid differentiation induced by G-CSF. We found that the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) motif (SM) at lysine 568 (VKAE) adjacent to the CIM was necessary to obtain the maximum transcriptional repressor activity of MEL1S. L-G3 cells expressing MEL1S, and bearing mutated CIM and SM differentiated into granulocytes in response to G-CSF; this indicated that both the SUMO modification at lysine 568 and CtBP binding were required for MEL1S-mediated transcriptional repression and blockade of differentiation, which might be relevant for the process of leukemogenesis.","['Nishikata, I', 'Nakahata, S', 'Saito, Y', 'Kaneda, K', 'Ichihara, E', 'Yamakawa, N', 'Morishita, K']","['Nishikata I', 'Nakahata S', 'Saito Y', 'Kaneda K', 'Ichihara E', 'Yamakawa N', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['onc2011132 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Oct 6;30(40):4194-207. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.132.

To determine whether or not FLT3 mutants respond to FL for their activation, a FL-deficient (FL(-/-)) murine embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell line was established. Expression of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutations in FL(-/-) MEF cells resulted in low levels of constitutive phosphorylation of FLT3. However, a more than fourfold increase of FLT3 autophosphorylation was induced by exogenous FL. Rescue of endogenous FL expression in FL(-/-) MEF cells expressing FLT3 mutants led to more than a threefold increase of FLT3 phosphorylation. FL addition led to further activation of the FLT3 receptors and enhanced survival and/or decreased apoptosis in leukemia-derived cell lines and primary leukemic cells expressing FLT3 mutations. Functional studies revealed that exogenous FL promoted the colony-forming and recloning abilities of FLT3 mutant transduced primary bone marrow cells derived from FL(-/-) mice. Endogenous FL contributes in vivo to functional signaling through FLT3 as noted by the decreased survival of FL(+/+)ITD(+/+) mice compared with FL(-/-)ITD(+/+) mice. These data suggest that FL leads to further activation of FLT3 mutants and is especially important in light of recent findings of elevated FL levels in acute myeloid leukemia patients in response to chemotherapy.","['Zheng, R', 'Bailey, E', 'Nguyen, B', 'Yang, X', 'Piloto, O', 'Levis, M', 'Small, D']","['Zheng R', 'Bailey E', 'Nguyen B', 'Yang X', 'Piloto O', 'Levis M', 'Small D']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011110 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Sep 22;30(38):4004-14. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.110.

This rare disease entity has a high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis. Although several retrospective analyses indicate that the treatment of this lymphoma has improved in the post-rituximab era, risk of CNS recurrence at 3 years still reaches ~25%. Considering the poor prognosis of IVLBCL patients with CNS recurrence, elucidating the optimal treatment strategies for this serious complication is vital in order to further improve its clinical management. Meanwhile, the efficacy of CNS prophylaxis for specific subtypes of lymphoma, for example Burkitt lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma, has been established, and several risk factors of CNS relapse for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were indicated by previous analyses. Considering that almost all IVLBCL patients have similar risk factors, CNS prophylaxis could also be effective, and thereby give rise to better clinical outcomes, in the treatment of IVLBCL, especially for patients without CNS involvement at initial diagnosis. Intensity regimens for CNS and systemic chemotherapy could be useful for patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis. This review describes the current understanding of clinical outcome and CNS involvement in IVLBCL, and discusses the optimal treatment strategy and future perspectives for CNS involvement of this rare lymphoma.","['Shimada, Kazuyuki']",['Shimada K'],"['Tenovus Research Laboratory (MP88), Cancer Sciences Division, Southampton University School of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Tremona Rd, Southampton, UK.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Brain Nerve,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,101299709,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['1416100905 [pii]'],ppublish,Brain Nerve. 2011 May;63(5):467-72.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ACVB protocol', 'VAP-cyclo protocol']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Rituximab', 'Vascular Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we analyzed DOCK10 mRNA diversity produced because of alternative splicing. Alternative first coding exon usage led to 2 main protein-coding transcripts, DOCK10.1 and DOCK10.2. Full-length cDNA clones of both isoforms were obtained from both normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse spleen for the first time for human DOCK10.1, mouse DOCK10.1, and mouse DOCK10.2. Human and mouse DOCK10.1 clones corresponded to the protein coding assemblies provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information as Reference Sequences for DOCK10. Our analysis especially focused on human cDNA clones, of which 63% were alternatively spliced forms involving diverse exons and introns. DOCK10.1 expression was enriched in normal T cells, and DOCK10.2 expression was enriched in normal B cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. Both isoforms were upregulated in response to interleukin-4 in B cells, both normal and CLL, but not in T cells.

Alternatively, NAD(+) may be dismantled to adenosine, up-taken by cells and transformed to reconstitute the intracellular nucleotide pool. An articulated ecto-enzyme network is responsible for the nucleotide-nucleoside conversion. CD38 is the main mammalian enzyme that hydrolyzes NAD(+), generating Ca(2+)-active metabolites. Evidence suggests that this extracellular network may be altered or used by tumor cells to (i) nestle in protected areas, and (ii) evade the immune response.

In a study of children with Hodgkin lymphoma, the addition of dexrazoxane may have been associated with a higher risk for developing second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) including acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We determined the incidence of SMNs in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who were treated with dexrazoxane. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2010, the Dana-Faber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium conducted three consecutive multicentre trials for children with newly diagnosed ALL. In the first (1996-2000), high risk patients were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin (30mg/m(2)/dose, cumulative dose 300mg/m(2)) preceded by dexrazoxane (300mg/m(2)/dose, 10 doses), or the same dose of doxorubicin without dexrazoxane, during induction and intensification phases. In subsequent trials (2000-2005 and 2005-2010), all high risk and very high risk patients received doxorubicin preceded by dexrazoxane. Cases of SMNs were collected prospectively and were pooled for analysis. The frequency and 5-year cumulative incidence (CI) of SMNs were determined for patients who had received dexrazoxane. FINDINGS: Among 553 patients treated with dexrazoxane (1996-2000, N=101; 2000-2005, N=196; and 2005-2010, N=256), the number of SMNs observed by protocol was 0 (median follow-up 9.6years), 0 (median follow-up 5.2years), and 1 (median follow-up 2.1years). The only SMN was a case of AML, which developed in a patient with MLL-rearranged ALL 2.14years after initial diagnosis. The overall 5-year CI of SMNs for all 553 patients was 0.24+/-0.24%. INTERPRETATION: In a large population of children with high risk ALL who received dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant drug, the occurrence of secondary AML was a rare event.","['Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Kelly, Kara M', 'Larsen, Eric C', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall', 'Schwartz, Cindy L', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sallan, Stephen E']","['Vrooman LM', 'Neuberg DS', 'Stevenson KE', 'Asselin BL', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell L', 'Cole PD', 'Kelly KM', 'Larsen EC', 'Laverdiere C', 'Michon B', 'Schorin M', 'Schwartz CL', 'Cohen HJ', 'Lipshultz SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA. lynda_vrooman@dfci.harvard.edu,']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00204-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 Jun;47(9):1373-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.022.

All myeloid progenitor cells are PTPIP51 positive except for the myeloblasts. To define the expression of PTPIP51 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed immunohistochemical experiments with peptide specific antibodies (C-terminus, N-terminus and aas 114-129) to PTPIP51 with samples of AML bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens. AML blasts reacted positive for PTPIP51 protein encompassing the C-terminal sequence. Healthy bone marrow displayed an exclusive staining for the N-terminal containing form of PTPIP51. Moreover, PTPIP51 protein was highly phosphorylated at its tyrosine 176 residue. Acquired confocal images of AML cells displayed an absence of PTP1B and revealed a co-localization of PTPIP51 and Lyn. Duolink proximity ligation assays (DPLA) corroborated an interaction for PTPIP51 with Lyn and c-Src. In AML blasts rarely an interaction of PTPIP51 with PTP1B and Raf-1 was seen. Furthermore, DPLA signals were also obtained for PTPIP51 and c-Kit in AML cells. Therefore, PTPIP51 was identified as a new signal molecule of the c-Kit signaling pathway. By the phosphorylation done by Lyn, c-Src and c-Kit, PTPIP51 is prevented to influence mitogen activated protein kinase pathway on Raf-1 level contributing to increased proliferation of AML cells.","['Brobeil, Alexander', 'Bobrich, Manuel', 'Graf, Michaela', 'Kruchten, Anke', 'Blau, Wolfgang', 'Rummel, Mathias', 'Oeschger, Sabine', 'Steger, Klaus', 'Wimmer, Monika']","['Brobeil A', 'Bobrich M', 'Graf M', 'Kruchten A', 'Blau W', 'Rummel M', 'Oeschger S', 'Steger K', 'Wimmer M']","['Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Aulweg 123, Giessen 35392, Germany.

Signal joint T-cell receptor excision DNA circles (sjTRECs) are markers of developmental proximity to the thymus that have been used to evaluate thymic function related to T-cell immune reconstitution after HSCT. To assess the proliferative history in different T-cell receptor beta variable region (TRBV) subfamilies of T cells after HSCT, expansion of TRBV subfamily-naive T cells was determined by analysis of a series of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs. METHODS: sjTRECs levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 43 Chinese acute leukemia patients who underwent allo-HSCT. Twenty-three TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs were amplified by semi-nested PCR. Sixteen age-matched healthy volunteers served as normal controls. RESULTS: sjTRECs levels were low or undetectable in the first 6 weeks after allo-HSCT and increased after 8 weeks post HSCT; however, sjTRECs levels at week 20 post-HSCT were still less than normal controls. Frequencies of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in PBMCs from recipients at week 8 post-HSCT (29.17 +/- 20.97%) or at week 16 post-HSCT (38.33 +/- 9.03%) were significantly lower than those in donors (47.92 +/- 13.82%) or recipients at pre-HSCT (45.83 +/- 14.03%). However, frequencies of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in recipients at week 30 post-HSCT (42.71 +/- 21.62%) were similar to those in donors and recipients at pre-HSCT. sjTRECs levels in donors had a positive linear correlation with sjTRECs levels in recipients within 8-12 weeks post-HSCT. Patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or chronic GVHD had profoundly reduced TRECs levels during the first year post-HSCT. Frequencies of BV22-BD1 sjTRECs and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in recipients at pre-HSCT, and the frequencies of BV22-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in donors. CONCLUSIONS: Reconstitution of thymic output function resulted in a period of immunodeficiency, with low or undetectable TRECs after transplantation, although fludarabine-based dose-reduced conditioning regimens were used. GVHD could affect reconstitution of thymic output function and reduce sjTRECs levels and frequencies of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs. Low frequency of BV22-BD1 and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs might be associated with GVHD.","['Wu, Xiuli', 'Zhu, Kanger', 'Du, Xin', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Wu, Jufeng', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Wu X', 'Zhu K', 'Du X', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Wu J', 'Liu Q', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,2011/04/26 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-4-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-4-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2011 Apr 23;4:19. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-4-19.,10.1186/1756-8722-4-19 [doi],20110423,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/immunology/surgery', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/surgery', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,PMC3094391,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, such oscillations are sometimes found in chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and then occur in all the derived blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It has been suggested that such oscillations arise because of an instability in the pluri-potential stem cell population, associated with its regulatory control system. In this paper, we consider how such oscillations can arise in a model of competition between normal (S) and genetically altered abnormal (A) stem cells, as the latter population grows at the expense of the former. We use an analytic model of long period oscillations to describe regions of oscillatory behaviour in the S-A phase plane, and give parametric criteria to describe when such oscillations will occur. We also describe a mechanism which can explain dynamically how the transformation from chronic phase to acute phase and blast crisis can occur.","['Drobnjak, Ivana', 'Fowler, A C']","['Drobnjak I', 'Fowler AC']","['Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,2011/04/23 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11538-011-9656-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Math Biol. 2011 Dec;73(12):2983-3007. doi: 10.1007/s11538-011-9656-2.

Over the last 50 years especially the transplantation of autologous and allogeneic stem cells from different sources after high-dose or myeloablative chemotherapy became a well-established standard therapy that cures or alleviates the symptoms in more than 50,000 patients/year worldwide. In the near future, the current progress in fundamental research on stem cells and immunobiology will allow for the clinical implementation of novel advanced cellular therapies, including gene therapeutic options. The European and German legislation have realized the need of international regulations for improved standardization and harmonization of stem cell transplants, associated cell-therapeutic agents as well as various tissue-engineered preparations in the emerging field of regenerative medicine. The Tissue Directive 2004/23/EC, issued and ratified by the European Parliament in March 2004, and its national transition into the German Tissue Act which came into force in July 2007 define the quality and safety standards for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells. These standards are of high relevance to ensure the efficient prevention of the transmission of viral and nonviral infectious pathogens and to achieve the same safeguards as in the population's blood supply. This review discusses the pros and cons of the new legislation and argues for keeping the administrative and regulative demands in reasonable limits and for offering innovative approaches of cellular therapies to the European citizens.","['Schlenke, Peter', 'Tapernon, Karin', 'Ahlke, Christoph', 'Mertens, Alexandra', 'Sibrowski, Walter']","['Schlenke P', 'Tapernon K', 'Ahlke C', 'Mertens A', 'Sibrowski W']","['Institut fur Transfusionsmedizin und Transplantationsimmunologie, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Transfus Med Hemother,Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,101176417,2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2011/04/23 06:00'],"['2008/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000171661 [doi]', '000171661 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfus Med Hemother. 2008;35(6):446-452. doi: 10.1159/000171661.

Autophagy plays an important role in adaptation to starvation, in cell survival, immunity, development and cancer. Recent evidence in mice suggests that autophagic defects in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may be implicated in leukemia. Indeed, mice lacking Atg7 in HSCs develop an atypical myeloproliferation resembling human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Studies suggest that accumulation of damaged mitochondria and reactive oxygen species result in cell death of the majority of progenitor cells and, possibly, concomitant transformation of some surviving ones. Interestingly, bone marrow cells from MDS patients are characterized by mitochondrial abnormalities and increased cell death. A role for autophagy in the transformation to cancer has been proposed in other cancer types.

To examine this hypothesis, we established a coculture platform [cells cocultured directly (cell-on-cell) or indirectly (separated by micropore membrane)] designed to interrogate the interplay between Janus activated kinase 2-V617F (JAK2(V617F))-positive cells and the stromal cells. Treatment with atiprimod, a potent JAK2 inhibitor, caused marked growth inhibition and apoptosis of human (SET-2) and mouse (FDCP-EpoR) JAK2(V617F)-positive cells as well as primary blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with polycythemia vera; however, these effects were attenuated when any of these cell types were cocultured (cell-on-cell) with human marrow stromal cell lines (e.g., HS5, NK.tert, TM-R1). Coculture with stromal cells hampered the ability of atiprimod to inhibit phosphorylation of JAK2 and the downstream STAT3 and STAT5 pathways. This protective effect was maintained in noncontact coculture assays (JAK2(V617F)-positive cells separated by 0.4-mum-thick micropore membranes from stromal cells), indicating a paracrine effect. Cytokine profiling of supernatants from noncontact coculture assays detected distinctly high levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and chemokine C-X-C-motif ligand 10 (CXCL-10)/IFN-gamma-inducible 10-kD protein (IP-10). Anti-IL-6, -FGF, or -CXCL-10/IP-10 neutralizing antibodies ablated the protective effect of stromal cells and restored atiprimod-induced apoptosis of JAK2(V617F)-positive cells. Therefore, our results indicate that humoral factors secreted by stromal cells protect MPN clones from JAK2 inhibitor therapy, thus underscoring the importance of targeting the marrow niche in MPN for therapeutic purposes.","['Manshouri, Taghi', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Burger, Jan', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Livun, Ana', 'Knez, Liza', 'Harris, David', 'Creighton, Chad J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Manshouri T', 'Estrov Z', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Burger J', 'Zhang Y', 'Livun A', 'Knez L', 'Harris D', 'Creighton CJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2011/04/23 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/23 06:00'],"['2011/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-4002 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Jun 1;71(11):3831-40. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4002.

Here we studied the activity of alpha-bisabolol in acute leukemia cells. METHODS: We tested ex vivo blasts from 42 acute leukemias (14 Philadelphia-negative and 14 Philadelphia-positive B acute lymphoid leukemias, Ph-/Ph+B-ALL; 14 acute myeloid leukemias, AML) for their sensitivity to alpha-bisabolol in 24-hour dose-response assays. Concentrations and time were chosen based on CD34+, CD33+my and normal peripheral blood cell sensitivity to increasing alpha-bisabolol concentrations for up to 120 hours. RESULTS: A clustering analysis of the sensitivity over 24 hours identified three clusters. Cluster 1 (14 +/- 5 muM alpha-bisabolol IC50) included mainly Ph-B-ALL cells. AML cells were split into cluster 2 and 3 (45 +/- 7 and 65 +/- 5 muM IC50). Ph+B-ALL cells were scattered, but mainly grouped into cluster 2. All leukemias, including 3 imatinib-resistant cases, were eventually responsive, but a subset of B-ALL cells was fairly sensitive to low alpha-bisabolol concentrations. alpha-bisabolol acted as a pro-apoptotic agent via a direct damage to mitochondrial integrity, which was responsible for the decrease in NADH-supported state 3 respiration and the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first evidence that alpha-bisabolol is a pro-apoptotic agent for primary human acute leukemia cells.","['Cavalieri, Elisabetta', 'Rigo, Antonella', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Carcereri de Prati, Alessandra', 'Guardalben, Emanuele', 'Bergamini, Christian', 'Fato, Romana', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Suzuki, Hisanori', 'Vinante, Fabrizio']","['Cavalieri E', 'Rigo A', 'Bonifacio M', 'Carcereri de Prati A', 'Guardalben E', 'Bergamini C', 'Fato R', 'Pizzolo G', 'Suzuki H', 'Vinante F']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Italy. fabrizio.vinante@univr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,2011/04/23 06:00,2011/09/13 06:00,['2011/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-9-45 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-9-45 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2011 Apr 21;9:45. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-9-45.,10.1186/1479-5876-9-45 [doi],20110421,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '24WE03BX2T (bisabolol)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/pathology', 'Blood Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",,PMC3112094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that p53 is critical for the inhibitory effect of cAMP on genotoxic agents-mediated apoptosis in BCP-ALLs. Here, we show that elevation of cAMP levels in cells exposed to DNA damage enhances the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappaB by accelerating the phosphorylation of IKKbeta and thereby phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Furthermore, we show that the ability of cAMP to potentiate the ionizing radiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB requires the activity of MEK. Importantly, pharmacological or genetic ablation of NF-kappaB reversed the inhibitory effect of cAMP on DNA damage-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that, in addition to p53, cAMP relies on the activity of NF-kappaB to provide cells with a survival advantage in the face of DNA damage. Collectively, our results uncover a novel and important interaction between the cAMP and NF-kappaB pathways that may have implications for the targeted treatment of lymphoid malignancies, such as BCP-ALL, in which aberrant NF-kappaB activity functions as a driving force for treatment resistance.","['Kloster, Martine M', 'Naderi, Elin H', 'Carlsen, Harald', 'Blomhoff, Heidi K', 'Naderi, Soheil']","['Kloster MM', 'Naderi EH', 'Carlsen H', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Naderi S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, PO Box 1112-Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,2011/04/23 06:00,2011/08/25 06:00,['2011/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-45 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-45 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Apr 21;10:45. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-45.,10.1186/1476-4598-10-45 [doi],20110421,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,PMC3095569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High dose therapy (HDT) followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allows physicians to administer increased amounts of chemotherapy and/or radiation while minimizing negative side effects such as damage to blood-producing bone marrow cells. Although HDT is successful in treating a wide range of cancers, it leads to lethal therapy-related myelodysplasia syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) in 5--10% of patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation for Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this study, we carried out metabolomic analysis of peripheral blood stem cell samples collected in a cohort of patients before hematopoietic cell transplantation to gain insights into the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of t-MDS. Nonparametric tests and multivariate analyses were used to compare the metabolite concentrations in samples from patients that developed t-MDS within 5 years of transplantation and the patients that did not. The results suggest that the development of t-MDS is associated with dysfunctions in cellular metabolic pathways. The top canonical pathways suggested by the metabolomic analysis include alanine and aspartate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, citrate acid cycle, and aminoacyl-t-RNA biosynthesis. Dysfunctions in these pathways indicate mitochondrial dysfunction that would result in decreased ability to detoxify reactive oxygen species generated by chemo and radiation therapy, therefore leading to cancer-causing mutations. These observations suggest predisposing factors for the development of t-MDS.","['Cano, Kristin E', 'Li, Liang', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Chen, Yuan']","['Cano KE', 'Li L', 'Bhatia S', 'Bhatia R', 'Forman SJ', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,2011/04/23 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/04/23 06:00'],"['2011/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr200200y [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2011 Jun 3;10(6):2873-81. doi: 10.1021/pr200200y.

Recently, there are some reports of leukemia and other hematological malignancies associated with the use of etanercept and in those conditions neutropenia could be the first manifestation.

Median age at time of ICH was 58 years, 49% were male, and 60% had acute myeloid leukemia. The relative incidence of ICH was highest in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (12.1%). Mental status changes were the most common symptom which prompted work-up for ICH. Median survival for all patients after onset of ICH was 20 days. In multivariate analyses, four clinical characteristics were identified as independent adverse factors for mortality in patients with ICH: albumin <3.5 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >835 U/L, age > 60 years, and relapsed disease status. Based on the number of risk factors, mortality after ICH was: 25% (0 risk factor), 47% (1), 78% (2), and >97% (3 or 4).

In this study, the authors set up a model system to explore epitope reactivity and its clinical relevance in CLL. METHODS: Epitope-mimicking peptides were selected from phage display libraries on 6 CLL BCRs from randomly chosen patients. The binding of the 6 index epitope mimics was evaluated in a set of 100 unrelated CLL samples. Epitope recognition patterns were correlated with the clinical course of the disease. RESULTS: Surprisingly, all CLL samples recognized 1 or several index epitopes, and some revealed marked polyreactivity. Patients with CLL who expressed BCRs that reacted with >/=5 epitope mimics had a significantly worse clinical course than less polyreactive patients (median time to first treatment, 24 months vs 102 months). This effect was independent of otherwise known prognostic markers. CONCLUSIONS: The authors introduced a system with which to model epitope reactivity of CLL BCRs without previous knowledge of potential antigens. The findings indicated that a polyreactive epitope recognition pattern may be a determinant of an aggressive clinical course in this disease. This further emphasizes the functional and prognostic relevance of BCR epitope recognition in CLL.","['Binder, Mascha', 'Muller, Fabian', 'Jackst, Antje', 'Lechenne, Barbara', 'Pantic, Milena', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Zu Eulenburg, Christine', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Mertelsmann, Roland', 'Pasqualini, Renata', 'Arap, Wadih', 'Trepel, Martin']","['Binder M', 'Muller F', 'Jackst A', 'Lechenne B', 'Pantic M', 'Bacher U', 'Zu Eulenburg C', 'Veelken H', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Pasqualini R', 'Arap W', 'Trepel M']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Hubertus Wald Cancer Center, University Medical Center, Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/07/29 06:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25755 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 May 1;117(9):1891-900. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25755.

The role of this classification in predicting recurrence and disease-free survival (DFS) in resected stage III CRC was evaluated. METHODS: Sporadic cancers from 161 patients were analyzed. Bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to examine the methylation of 2 global DNA methylation markers (LINE-1, Alu) and 9 loci (MINT1, MINT2, MINT31, P16, hMLH1, P14, SFRP1, SFRP2, and WNT5A). Mutations in BRAF and KRAS were assayed. RESULTS: Gene hypermethylation clustered in discrete groups of patients, indicating the presence of CIMP. K-means clustering analysis identified 3 discrete subgroups: CIMP1 (n = 22, 13.7%), associated with proximal location and BRAF mutations; CIMP2 (n = 40, 24.8%), associated with KRAS mutations; and CIMP-negative (n = 99, 61.5%), associated with distal location. In proximal CRC, CIMP1 was correlated with a higher recurrence rate (53% for CIMP1, 18% for CIMP2, and 26% for CIMP-negative) and a worse DFS (P = .015). Also in proximal CRC, LINE-1 methylation was lower in patients whose cancer recurred compared with those whose cancer did not recur (P = .049). In multivariate analysis, CIMP1 and low LINE1 methylation were independent prognostic factors for DFS in proximal CRC (P = .008 for classification by K-means clustering analysis; P = .040 for LINE-1 methylation status). CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation is a useful biomarker of recurrence in resected stage III proximal but not distal CRC. However, as the number of CIMP1 cases was small in distal CRC, further study is required to validate our findings.","['Ahn, Joong Bae', 'Chung, Woon Bok', 'Maeda, Osamu', 'Shin, Sang Joon', 'Kim, Hyun Soo', 'Chung, Hyun Chul', 'Kim, Nam Kyu', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Ahn JB', 'Chung WB', 'Maeda O', 'Shin SJ', 'Kim HS', 'Chung HC', 'Kim NK', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In this review, the authors discuss currently available therapies for CML, focusing on mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and treatment strategies to overcome resistance. Relevant articles were identified through searches of PubMed and abstracts from international hematology/oncology congresses. Additional information sources were identified from the bibliographies of these references and from the authors' own libraries and expertise. In vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ) data alone are not sufficient to guide the choice of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the presence of a mutant breakpoint cluster region-v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (BCR-ABL) clone, because there is a lack of data regarding how well such IC(50) values correlate with clinical response. A small subset of BCR-ABL mutant clones have been associated with impaired responses to second-generation TKIs (tyrosine to histidine mutation at codon 253 [Y253H], glutamic acid to lysine or valine mutation at codon 255 [E255K/V], and phenylalanine to cysteine or valine mutation at codon 359 [F359C/V] for nilotinib; valine to leucine mutation at codon 299 [V299L] and F317L for dasatinib); neither nilotinib nor dasatinib is active against the threonine to isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I). For each second-generation TKI, the detection of 1 of a small subset of mutations at the time of resistance may be helpful in the selection of second-line therapy [corrected]. For the majority of patients, comorbidities and drug safety profiles should be the basis for choosing a second-line agent.

Since chronic fatigue is commonly reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) we aimed at testing the presence of this virus in these patients. METHODS: Ninety-five SLE patients, 45 of whom had a Fatigue Severity Scale score higher than 3, were included. Molecular analyses were performed by PCR from DNA obtained from the whole blood of both SLE patients and 50 healthy controls. RESULTS: None of the 145 samples analyzed yielded the specific XMRV PCR product. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that XMRV is not detected in blood neither from SLE patients nor from healthy controls. It leads to infer that other environmental and biological triggers (different from XMRV) may account for the increased levels of fatigue over the course of SLE.","['Balada, Eva', 'Castro-Marrero, Jesus', 'Felip, Lledo', 'Vilardell-Tarres, Miquel', 'Ordi-Ros, Josep']","['Balada E', 'Castro-Marrero J', 'Felip L', 'Vilardell-Tarres M', 'Ordi-Ros J']","[""Research Unit in Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Vall d'Hebron Hospital, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. ebalada@ir.vhebron.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,2011/04/22 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10875-011-9535-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2011 Aug;31(4):584-7. doi: 10.1007/s10875-011-9535-5.

METHODS: The study population comprised 64 children with ALL/ML (age 1.6-16.8 years) who had received a total of 252 MTX courses (2-4 per patient). Common putative functional polymorphisms in the SLC19A1, MTHFR, MS, MTRR, TS and ABCB1 genes were analysed by PCR-based genotyping. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS: The population typical value of clearance was 7.43 L/h (inter-individual variability 43.9%), central compartment volume was 16.7 L (46.6%), peripheral compartment volume was 2.6 L (63.3%) and distribution clearance was 0.0952 L/h (66.6%). MTX clearance decreased to 73.8% in patients with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Patients homozygous for the variant MTHFR 1298A > C [odds ratio (OR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.037-0.54] and SLC19A1 80A > G (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.039-0.60) were at decreased risk for leucopenia. The TS 2R > 3R polymorphism was associated with a lower incidence of thrombocytopenia (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.039-0.61) and mucositis (OR 0.016, 95% CI 0.0012-0.20). In contrast, the MTHFR 677TT polymorphism was associated with an increased incidence of mucositis (OR 23, 95% CI 2.1-240). CONCLUSIONS: A population pharmacokinetic model developed in this study implies only a limited influence of genetic factors on the systemic disposition of MTX. Clearance is moderately reduced in patients with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Genetic polymorphisms in the folate metabolic pathway and SLC19A1 were associated with HD-MTX toxicity.","['Faganel Kotnik, Barbara', 'Grabnar, Iztok', 'Bohanec Grabar, Petra', 'Dolzan, Vita', 'Jazbec, Janez']","['Faganel Kotnik B', 'Grabnar I', 'Bohanec Grabar P', 'Dolzan V', 'Jazbec J']","[""Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Bohoriceva 20, Ljubljana, Slovenia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,2011/04/22 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-011-1046-z [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2011 Oct;67(10):993-1006. doi: 10.1007/s00228-011-1046-z.

This disease has been reported in cats from the USA, Europe and Australia. However, its epidemiology is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to describe T. foetus infection in a Persian cattery in Spain. T. foetus infection was sequentially diagnosed in 20 cats by direct faecal smear examined under the microscope, specific culture (In Pouch TF medium) and PCR. A standard coprological sedimentation method was also performed in order to screen for other intestinal parasites in all the cats included. In addition, sera were tested for IgG antibodies against Leishmania infantum, Toxoplasma gondii, and for the detection of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). Five out of 20 cats were positive for T. foetus (25%), two of them by microscopy, culture and PCR and three by culture and PCR. No association was found between T. foetus infection and age or sex. L. infantum and T. gondii seroprevalence rates were 15% and 10%, respectively. The prevalence of FeLV p27 antigen and of FIV antibodies in the study population was zero. Cystoisospora spp. oocysts were detected in one cat. These preliminary results show that the transmission of T. foetus infection in cluster conditions may occur between asymptomatic cats and young or immunocompromised animals.","['Miro, Guadalupe', 'Hernandez, Leticia', 'Montoya, Ana', 'Arranz-Solis, David', 'Dado, Diana', 'Rojo-Montejo, Silvia', 'Mendoza-Ibarra, Jesus Alberto', 'Ortega-Mora, Luis Miguel', 'Pedraza-Diaz, Susana']","['Miro G', 'Hernandez L', 'Montoya A', 'Arranz-Solis D', 'Dado D', 'Rojo-Montejo S', 'Mendoza-Ibarra JA', 'Ortega-Mora LM', 'Pedraza-Diaz S']","['Departamento de Sanidad Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Avda.

Our findings indicate that in some cases MRI detects leukemia at an earlier phase than does bone marrow aspiration, suggesting that MRI is useful for the diagnosis of acute leukemia.","['Kato, Motohiro', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Kikuchi, Akira', 'Toyama, Daisuke', 'Mochizuki, Shinji', 'Uchisaka, Naoki', 'Nagatoshi, Yoshihisa', 'Tanaka, Risa', 'Oh-Ishi, Tsutomu', 'Nozawa, Kumiko', 'Oguma, Eiji', 'Hanada, Ryoji']","['Kato M', 'Koh K', 'Kikuchi A', 'Toyama D', 'Mochizuki S', 'Uchisaka N', 'Nagatoshi Y', 'Tanaka R', 'Oh-Ishi T', 'Nozawa K', 'Oguma E', 'Hanada R']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, 2100 Magome, Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, 2100 Magome, Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama, Japan. kkoh-tokyo@umin.ac.jp."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo University, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, 2100 Magome, Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, 2100 Magome, Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, 2100 Magome, Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, 2100 Magome, Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases/Immunology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases/Immunology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Radiology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Radiology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, 2100 Magome, Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/10/20 06:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0842-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0842-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Jun;93(6):787-790. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0842-7.

Metal transporters including divalent metal transporter 1, Zrt/Irt-related protein (ZIP) 8, and ZIP14, and certain types of voltage-dependent Ca channels have been shown to be involved in cellular Cd uptake. However, tissue- or cell-specific roles of these metal transporters in the accumulation and toxicity of Cd remains unclear. In the present study, we compared the sensitivity to and accumulation of Cd, Mn, and Zn among four types of rat cell lines. Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells showed the highest sensitivity to Cd and Mn due to the highest accumulation of Cd and Mn among the four cell lines. The high accumulation of Cd and Mn was caused by high uptake rates of Cd and Mn. Since relatively high expression of ZIP8 and ZIP14 was found in RBL-2H3 cells, siRNAs of ZIP8 and ZIP14 were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. The knockdown of ZIP8, but not of ZIP14, significantly reduced the uptake rates of Cd and Mn in RBL-2H3 cells, especially in the presence of bicarbonate. These results suggest that the high expression of ZIP8, which is known to have affinities for both Cd and Mn, resulted in high accumulation of Cd and Mn, leading to high sensitivity to these metals in RBL-2H3 cells. Thus, RBL-2H3 cells may serve as a good model for clarifying the mechanisms of Cd and Mn transport via ZIP8.","['Fujishiro, Hitomi', 'Doi, Miwako', 'Enomoto, Shuichi', 'Himeno, Seiichiro']","['Fujishiro H', 'Doi M', 'Enomoto S', 'Himeno S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Nutrition and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/10/22 06:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c1mt00020a [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2011 Jul;3(7):710-8. doi: 10.1039/c1mt00020a.

Although high levels of wild-type p53 and hardly any TP53 mutations are found in testicular cancer (TC), chemotherapy resistance is still observed in a significant subgroup of TC patients. In the present study, we demonstrate that p53 resides in a complex with MDM2 at higher cisplatin concentrations in cisplatin-resistant human TC cells compared with cisplatin-sensitive TC cells. Inhibition of the MDM2-p53 interaction using either Nutlin-3 or MDM2 RNA interference resulted in hyperactivation of the p53 pathway and a strong induction of apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant TC cells. Suppression of wild-type p53 induced resistance to Nutlin-3 in TC cells, demonstrating the key role of p53 for Nutlin-3 sensitivity. More specifically, our results indicate that p53-dependent induction of Fas membrane expression ( approximately threefold) and enhanced Fas/FasL interactions at the cell surface are important mechanisms of Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in TC cells. Importantly, an analogous Fas-dependent mechanism of apoptosis upon Nutlin-3 treatment is executed in wild-type p53 expressing Hodgkin lymphoma and acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines. Finally, we demonstrate that Nutlin-3 strongly augmented cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell kill via the Fas death receptor pathway. This effect is most pronounced in cisplatin-resistant TC cells.","['Koster, R', 'Timmer-Bosscha, H', 'Bischoff, R', 'Gietema, J A', 'de Jong, S']","['Koster R', 'Timmer-Bosscha H', 'Bischoff R', 'Gietema JA', 'de Jong S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/11/02 06:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201133 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2011.33 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2011 Apr 21;2:e148. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2011.33.,10.1038/cddis.2011.33 [doi],20110421,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Testicular Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",,PMC3122064,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by severe circulating monocytopenia, NK- and B-lymphocytopenia, severe infections with M. avium complex (MAC), and risk of progression to myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia. Detailed bone marrow analyses performed on 18 patients further define this disorder. The majority of patients had hypocellular marrows with reticulin fibrosis and multilineage dysplasia affecting the myeloid (72%), erythroid (83%) and megakaryocytic (100%) lineages. Cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 10 of 17 (59%). Despite B-lymphocytopenia, plasma cells were present but were abnormal (e.g. CD56(+)) in nearly half of cases. Increased T-cell large granular lymphocyte populations were present in 28% of patients.

Early studies found peripheral blood involvement to be an adverse prognostic factor; however, cases of a seemingly indolent variant of mantle cell lymphoma, characterized by peripheral blood involvement and minimal nodal disease, have been incompletely described, particularly with regard to bone marrow findings. We report a series of leukemic phase mantle cell lymphomas with a non-progressive or slowly progressive course. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cases presenting with mantle cell lymphoma limited to the peripheral blood/bone marrow from 2000-2010 were identified. Diagnoses were established by morphology, flow cytometric analysis and requisite evidence of IGH-CCND1@ by fluorescence in-situ hybridization or t(11;14)(q13;q32) by cytogenetics. Patients with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and gastrointestinal symptomatology were excluded. RESULTS: Patients (n=8, median age 60.5 years) were asymptomatic with mild lymphocytosis (8.7x10(9)/L; range, 4.5-14.2x10(9)/L) and cytology typical of mantle cell lymphoma. Flow cytometric analysis showed that all expressed CD5, CD19, CD20, variable CD23, and a striking kappa immunoglobulin light chain restriction (7/8 cases). Bone marrow biopsy at diagnosis showed interstitial single or small lymphoid aggregates with similar patterns of CD20 and cyclin D1 immunostaining which were not readily discernable by hematoxylin and eosin stain. SOX11 was negative (4/5) or only weakly expressed (1/5). The median follow-up was 27 months (range, 5-109 months) and all patients, but one, are alive with no clinical evidence of disease. The prevalence of indolent mantle cell lymphoma presenting only with lymphocytosis, among all mantle cell lymphomas diagnosed during the same period, was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic mantle cell lymphoma limited to blood and bone marrow is an indolent variant characterized by mild-moderate lymphocytosis, interstitial low-level bone marrow involvement, simple karyotype, kappa light chain expression, cyclin D1 expression with lack of SOX11, and slow or absent clinical progression. Some cases may represent a mantle cell lymphoma counterpart to chronic lymphocytic leukemia - phenotype monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. Recognition of this variant could inform treatment decisions and possibly avoid unnecessary treatment.","['Ondrejka, Sarah L', 'Lai, Raymond', 'Smith, Stephen D', 'Hsi, Eric D']","['Ondrejka SL', 'Lai R', 'Smith SD', 'Hsi ED']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.036277 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.036277 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Aug;96(8):1121-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.036277.

However, the majority of older adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are not candidates for myeloablative conditioning regimens. A non-myeloablative preparative regimen is a reasonable treatment option for this group. We sought to determine the outcome of non-myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic transplantation in patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients (median age 56 years) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from sibling or unrelated donors after fludarabine and 2 Gray total body irradiation. Twenty-five patients had Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Eighteen of these patients received post-grafting imatinib. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 43 months, the 3-year overall survival was 34%. The 3-year relapse/progression and non-relapse mortality rates were 40% and 28%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grades II and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease were 53% and 6%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 44%. Hematopoietic cell transplantation in first complete remission and post-grafting imatinib were associated with improved survival (P=0.005 and P=0.03, respectively). Three-year overall survival rates for patients with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission and beyond first remission were 52% and 8%, respectively. For patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission who received post-grafting imatinib, the 3-year overall survival rate was 62%; for the subgroup without evidence of minimal residual disease at transplantation, the overall survival was 73%. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission, non-myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, with post-grafting imatinib for Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease, can result in favorable long-term survival.","['Ram, Ron', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Maloney, David G', 'Woolfrey, Ann', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Maris, Michael B', 'Laport, Ginna G', 'Chauncey, Thomas R', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Langston, Amelia A', 'Storer, Barry', 'Georges, George E']","['Ram R', 'Storb R', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Maloney DG', 'Woolfrey A', 'Flowers ME', 'Maris MB', 'Laport GG', 'Chauncey TR', 'Lange T', 'Langston AA', 'Storer B', 'Georges GE']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue N., Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.040261 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.040261 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Aug;96(8):1113-20. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.040261.

However, few studies have systematically compared these different RNA-based markers. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using real-time quantitative PCR, we measured the mRNA expression levels of these genes in unsorted samples from 252 newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and correlated our data with established prognostic markers (for example Binet stage, CD38, IGHV gene mutational status and genomic aberrations) and clinical outcome. RESULTS: High expression levels of all RNA-based markers, except MCL1, predicted shorter overall survival and time to treatment, with LPL being the most significant. In multivariate analysis including the RNA-based markers, LPL expression was the only independent prognostic marker for overall survival and time to treatment. When studying LPL expression and the established markers, LPL expression retained its independent prognostic strength for overall survival. All of the RNA-based markers, albeit with varying ability, added prognostic information to established markers, with LPL expression giving the most significant results. Notably, high LPL expression predicted a worse outcome in good-prognosis subgroups, such as patients with mutated IGHV genes, Binet stage A, CD38 negativity or favorable cytogenetics. In particular, the combination of LPL expression and CD38 could further stratify Binet stage A patients. CONCLUSIONS: LPL expression is the strongest RNA-based prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia that could potentially be applied to predict outcome in the clinical setting, particularly in the large group of patients with favorable prognosis.","['Kaderi, Mohd Arifin', 'Kanduri, Meena', 'Buhl, Anne Mette', 'Sevov, Marie', 'Cahill, Nicola', 'Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Jansson, Mattias', 'Smedby, Karin Ekstrom', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Kaderi MA', 'Kanduri M', 'Buhl AM', 'Sevov M', 'Cahill N', 'Gunnarsson R', 'Jansson M', 'Smedby KE', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Jurlander J', 'Juliusson G', 'Mansouri L', 'Rosenquist R']","['Dept. of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.039396 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.039396 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Aug;96(8):1153-60. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.039396.

Bile salts stimulate cell survival and proliferation through the mitogen-activated protein kinase, but the downstream signaling mechanism(s) remains enigmatic. Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic molecule of the Bcl2 family that is extensively overexpressed in tumor tissues of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RESULTS: Here we found that exposure of HepG2 cells to GCDA results in activation of ERK1 and ERK2 and phosphorylation of Mcl-1 in a PD98059 (MEK inhibitor)-sensitive manner. GCDA stimulates Mcl-1 phosphorylation in cells expressing WT but not T163A Mcl-1 mutant, indicating that GCDA-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation occurs exclusively at the T163 site in its PEST region. GCDA-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation at T163 enhances the half-life of Mcl-1. Treatment of HepG2 cells with GCDA facilitates Mcl-1 dissociation from Mule (a physiological Mcl-1 ubiquitin E3 ligase). Specific depletion of Mcl-1 from HepG2 cells by RNA interference increases sensitivity of HepG2 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (i.e. cisplatin and irinotecan). In addition to activation of the ERK/Mcl-1 survival pathway, GCDA can also induce dose-dependent apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites of DNA lesions, which may partially neutralize its survival activity. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that bile salt may function as a survival agonist and/or potential carcinogen in the development of HCC. Molecular approaches that inactivate Mcl-1 by blocking its T163 phosphorylation may represent new strategies for treatment of HCC.","['Liao, Mingmei', 'Zhao, Jinfeng', 'Wang, Ton', 'Duan, Jinghua', 'Zhang, Yangde', 'Deng, Xingming']","['Liao M', 'Zhao J', 'Wang T', 'Duan J', 'Zhang Y', 'Deng X']","['National Hepatobiliary & Enteric Surgery Research Center, Department of Surgery, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,2011/04/22 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-44 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-44 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Apr 20;10:44. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-44.,10.1186/1476-4598-10-44 [doi],20110420,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '640-79-9 (Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],PMC3107804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coating with nano-thin modified shells allowed for maintenance of the evaluated cells' integrity and viability during the 8-day culture. The different PE impact may be observed on different biological materials. The islets exhibited lower mitochondrial activity than the Jurkat cells. Nevertheless, coating of cells with polyelectrolyte modified membrane allowed for functioning of both model cell types: 10 mum leukemia cells or 150 mum islets during the culture.

A number of these synthesized ligands, in particular 2, 3, and 11, were found to exhibit a high RARalpha activation potential and to effectively induce post-differentiation apoptosis in NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. Increasing the length of the side chain attached to the heterocycle of the carbazole arotinoids creates new opportunities for altered compound catabolism and for fine-tuning of the apoptosis-inducing potential of the ligand. In the carbazole series of new retinoids, maximal activity was established for N-butylcarbazole analogue 11 in all assays (i.e., RARalpha activation, differentiation induction, and apoptosis induction). Study of the mechanism of apoptosis revealed an activation of initiator caspases-8 and -9, followed by efficient cleavage of effector caspase-3 on day 6 of treatment. Subsequent induction of a caspase cascade in NB4 cells triggered ultimate leukemic cell death. The selected ligands 2, 3, and 11 may provide alternate options for the treatment of APL in cases of life-threatening ATRA syndrome, resistance, and high toxicity to conventionally used retinoids.","['Ivanova, Diana', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich', 'de Lera, Angel R']","['Ivanova D', 'Gronemeyer H', 'de Lera AR']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Vigo, 36310 Vigo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cmdc.201100065 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2011 Aug 1;6(8):1518-29. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201100065.

Histone H2AX phosphorylation (ser139) (gammaH2AX) occurs rapidly at the onset of DNA double strand break (DSB) and is critical to the regulation of DSB repair. If DNA repair is successful, cells exposed to anti-neoplastic drugs will keep entering the cycle and develop resistance to the drugs. In this study, we investigated whether gammaH2AX can be used as an indicator of tumor chemosensitivity and a potential target for enhancing chemotherapy. K562 and multi-drug resistant cell line K562/A02 were exposed to adriamycin (ADR) and gammaH2AX formed. Flow cytometry revealed that percentage of cells expressing gammaH2AX was increased in a dose-dependent manner and the percentage of K562/A02 cells was lower than that of K562 cells when treated with the same concentration of ADR. In order to test the potential of gammaH2AX to reverse drug resistance, K562/A02 cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002. It was found that LY249002 decreased ADR-induced gammaH2AX expression and increased the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADR. Additionally, the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay and the Western blotting showed that LY249002 enhanced DSBs and decreased the expression of repair factor BRCA1.

At the initial diagnosis, most peripheral blood cells demonstrated proliferation of indolent T cell small cell variants, i.e., small to medium prolymphocytes with inconspicuous nucleoli and a normal karyotype. These cells were positive for surface CD4, CD5, and CD7, and cytoplasmic CD3, but negative for surface CD3 and CD8 and cytoplasmic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The T cell receptor (TCR) Cbeta1 gene was rearranged in the cells. Large prolymphocytes with prominent nucleoli, irregular nuclei, and cytoplasmic vacuoles that exhibited chromosome 8 trisomy were observed about 1.5 years later. The CD4+CD8- single positive effector memory T cells transformed into surface CD4+CD8+ double positive precursor T cells. The clonal TCR gene rearrangement patterns of these cells were identical throughout the clinical course, suggesting clonal blast transformation. The CD4+CD8+ cells demonstrated increased chromosome 8 trisomy combined with complex chromosome abnormalities with t(14;14)(q11.2;q32) containing a 14q32 chromosome after transformation. T cell leukemia 1a (TCL1a) (14q32.1) may be implicated in this case. The TCL1a oncoprotein is expressed in approximately 70% of T-PLL cases. The disease gradually developed resistance to chemotherapy, and the patient died of the disease. It is known that indolent T-PLL can become aggressive. Therefore, similar transformations may occur in other aggressive T-PLL cases, particularly those involving trisomy 8 and TCL1a.","['Ichikawa, Kunimoto', 'Noguchi, Masaaki', 'Imai, Hidenori', 'Sekiguchi, Yasunobu', 'Wakabayashi, Mutsumi', 'Sawada, Tomohiro', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Ichikawa K', 'Noguchi M', 'Imai H', 'Sekiguchi Y', 'Wakabayashi M', 'Sawada T', 'Komatsu N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, 2-1-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8421, Japan. kichika@juntendo.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Urayasu Hospital, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan. kichika@juntendo.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Urayasu Hospital, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Urayasu Hospital, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Urayasu Hospital, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Urayasu Hospital, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Laboratory, Urayasu Hospital, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, 2-1-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8421, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0826-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0826-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 May;93(5):667-672. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0826-7.

Roscovitine and related compounds, like seliciclib and olomoucine, are effective inducers of apoptosis in many proliferating cells in culture. These compounds are known to activate the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In order to better characterize this intrinsic pathway, a transcriptional analysis was performed using the reverse transcriptase-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification procedure (RT-MLPA). In five cell lines, we detected an early and marked reduction of most transcripts, which is consistent with the disruption of transcription that results from the inhibition of CDK7 and CDK9. However, the mRNA of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) gene escaped from this transcription inhibition in neuroblastoma cells with a functional p53 protein. The increase of PUMA mRNA was not found in roscovitine-treated cell lines defective in p53, which underwent apoptosis like their p53 proficient counterparts. In addition, in SH-SY5Y cells, sublethal and lethal concentrations of roscovitine produced equivalent increases of PUMA mRNA and protein. In conclusion, the increased expression of PUMA was not associated with apoptosis induction. On the contrary, mRNA and protein depletion of MCL-1 gene correlated the best with cell demise. Moreover, NOXA protein suffered a far minor decrease than MCL-1. Because of the selective neutralization of NOXA by MCL-1, we hypothesize that the disruption of this balance is a critical event in apoptosis induction by roscovitine and related compounds.","['Garrofe-Ochoa, Xenia', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Ribas, Judit', 'Gil, Joan', 'Boix, Jacint']","['Garrofe-Ochoa X', 'Cosialls AM', 'Ribas J', 'Gil J', 'Boix J']","['Molecular Pharmacology Group, Departament de Medicina Experimental, IRBLLEIDA-Universitat de Lleida, C/Montserrat Roig 2, 25008, Lleida, Catalunya, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0603-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2011 Jul;16(7):660-70. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0603-3.,10.1007/s10495-011-0603-3 [doi],,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Roscovitine', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, different from the single-gene disorders, high heterogeneity of many of the complex diseases prevents scientists from the exact understanding of the etiology. In this study, we used Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDSs), a heterogeneous family of clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells, as a general model to explore the network properties of the heterogeneity of complex diseases. First, static bioinformatics analysis suggests that despite the huge heterogeneity of MDSs, their clinical properties can be explained well by the local properties of MDS-related genes on the human interactome. Then we design a novel systems biological method to explore the pattern of genetic abnormality propagation of a real MDS cohort by integrating flowcytometry, genotyping, gene expression profiling, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) mapping and pathway inference. We constructed a MDS disease gene network which suggests the network basis of the heterogeneity of MDSs. The pipeline we proposed and the implication the results suggest may be helpful in the research of other complex diseases.","['Ren, Xianwen', 'Zhou, Xiaobo', 'Chang, Chung-Che']","['Ren X', 'Zhou X', 'Chang CC']","['State Key Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Genetic Engineering, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China, 100730. renxwise@ipbcams.ac.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Mol Biosyst,Molecular bioSystems,101251620,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/09/08 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c1mb05018d [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biosyst. 2011 Jun;7(6):2048-54. doi: 10.1039/c1mb05018d.

Research activities focusing on the mechanisms that underlie imatinib resistance have identified mutations in the BCR-ABL gene, clonal evolution, and amplification of the BCR-ABL gene as common causes. Cytogenetic and molecular techniques are currently used to monitor cml therapy for both response and relapse. With multiple and more potent therapeutic options now available, monitoring techniques can permit treatment to be tailored to the individual patient based on disease characteristics-for example, according to BCR-ABL mutation profile or to patient characteristics such as certain comorbid conditions.

Viral proteins Tax and HBZ, encoded by the sense and antisense strands of the pX region, respectively, play key roles in HTLV-1 persistence. Tax drives CD4(+)-T cell clonal expansion and is the immunodominant viral antigen recognized by the immune response. Valproate (2-n-propylpentanoic acid, VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was thought to trigger Tax expression, thereby exposing the latent HTLV-1 reservoir to immune destruction. We evaluated the impact of VPA on Tax, Gag, and HBZ expressions in cultured lymphocytes from HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers and HAM/TSP patients. Approximately one-fifth of provirus-positive CD4(+) T cells spontaneously became Tax-positive, but this fraction rose to two-thirds of Tax-positive-infected cells when cultured with VPA. Valproate enhanced Gag-p19 release. Tax- and Gag-mRNA levels peaked spontaneously, before declining concomitantly to HBZ-mRNA increase. VPA enhanced and prolonged Tax-mRNA expression, whereas it blocked HBZ expression.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether whole-genome sequencing can identify cryptic, actionable mutations in a clinically relevant time frame. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENT: We were referred a difficult diagnostic case of acute promyelocytic leukemia with no pathogenic X-RARA fusion identified by routine metaphase cytogenetics or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The case patient was enrolled in an institutional review board-approved protocol, with consent specifically tailored to the implications of whole-genome sequencing. The protocol uses a ""movable firewall"" that maintains patient anonymity within the entire research team but allows the research team to communicate medically relevant information to the treating physician. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical relevance of whole-genome sequencing and time to communicate validated results to the treating physician. RESULTS: Massively parallel paired-end sequencing allowed identification of a cytogenetically cryptic event: a 77-kilobase segment from chromosome 15 was inserted en bloc into the second intron of the RARA gene on chromosome 17, resulting in a classic bcr3 PML-RARA fusion gene. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction sequencing subsequently validated the expression of the fusion transcript. Novel FISH probes identified 2 additional cases of t(15;17)-negative acute promyelocytic leukemia that had cytogenetically invisible insertions. Whole-genome sequencing and validation were completed in 7 weeks and changed the treatment plan for the patient. CONCLUSION: Whole-genome sequencing can identify cytogenetically invisible oncogenes in a clinically relevant time frame.","['Welch, John S', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Ding, Li', 'Larson, David E', 'Klco, Jeffery M', 'Kulkarni, Shashikant', 'Wallis, John', 'Chen, Ken', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Veizer, Joelle', 'Schmidt, Heather', 'Vickery, Tammi L', 'Heath, Sharon', 'Watson, Mark A', 'Tomasson, Michael H', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Wilson, Richard K']","['Welch JS', 'Westervelt P', 'Ding L', 'Larson DE', 'Klco JM', 'Kulkarni S', 'Wallis J', 'Chen K', 'Payton JE', 'Fulton RS', 'Veizer J', 'Schmidt H', 'Vickery TL', 'Heath S', 'Watson MA', 'Tomasson MH', 'Link DC', 'Graubert TA', 'DiPersio JF', 'Mardis ER', 'Ley TJ', 'Wilson RK']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['305/15/1577 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2011.497 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2011 Apr 20;305(15):1577-84. doi: 10.1001/jama.2011.497.,10.1001/jama.2011.497 [doi],,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']","['P01 CA101937-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079-08/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 HL103975/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG003079/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3156695,,,"['JAMA. 2011 Apr 20;305(15):1596-7.

However, in many cases of suspected cancer susceptibility, the family history is unclear and genetic testing of common cancer susceptibility genes is unrevealing. OBJECTIVE: To apply whole-genome sequencing to a patient without any significant family history of cancer but with suspected increased cancer susceptibility because of multiple primary tumors to identify rare or novel germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANT: Skin (normal) and bone marrow (leukemia) DNA were obtained from a patient with early-onset breast and ovarian cancer (negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations) and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) and analyzed with the following: whole-genome sequencing using paired-end reads, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, RNA expression profiling, and spectral karyotyping. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Structural variants, copy number alterations, single-nucleotide variants, and small insertions and deletions (indels) were detected and validated using the described platforms. RESULTS; Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel, heterozygous 3-kilobase deletion removing exons 7-9 of TP53 in the patient's normal skin DNA, which was homozygous in the leukemia DNA as a result of uniparental disomy. In addition, a total of 28 validated somatic single-nucleotide variations or indels in coding genes, 8 somatic structural variants, and 12 somatic copy number alterations were detected in the patient's leukemia genome.

CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old white male with Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia was prescribed rituximab 375 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion. Rituximab 50 mg/h was initiated after premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and ondansetron 3 days into his hospital course. Five minutes after the infusion had begun, he experienced a significant decrease in blood pressure to 76/45 mm Hg, and the infusion was stopped. After 30 minutes, the blood pressure returned to normal. Rechallenge with rituximab 25 mg/h was attempted, but the blood pressure again declined and the patient experienced chills and rigors. The infusion was discontinued, and the symptoms resolved 1 hour later. DISCUSSION: Infusion-related adverse reactions associated with rituximab are reported at a higher rate than with other monoclonal antibodies. Hypotension with rituximab has been reported to occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after initiation of the infusion. In contrast, severe hypotension in our patient occurred within 5 minutes after the infusion was started in a patient with no previous exposure to the drug. While many studies hypothesize that cytokine release from lymphocytes and tumor cell agglutination might contribute to severe infusion-related reactions with rituximab, the mechanism of action is not yet known. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated that the hypotension was probably associated with rituximab administration. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the rapidity of this adverse effect in patients who have not received prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies is important during chemotherapy treatment.","['Vo, Kevin H', 'Waddell, James Aubrey', 'Suda, Katie J']","['Vo KH', 'Waddell JA', 'Suda KJ']","['College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Knoxville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1P733 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1P733 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2011 May;45(5):e29. doi: 10.1345/aph.1P733.

The BCR-ABL(T315I) mutant is highly resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, and is frequently detected in relapsed patients. This critical gap in resistance coverage drove development of DCC-2036, an ABL inhibitor that binds the switch control pocket involved in conformational regulation of the kinase domain. We evaluated the efficacy of DCC-2036 against BCR-ABL(T315I) and other mutants in cellular and biochemical assays and conducted cell-based mutagenesis screens. DCC-2036 inhibited autophosphorylation of ABL and ABL(T315I) enzymes, and this activity was consistent with selective efficacy against Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (IC(50): 19 nmol/L), BCR-ABL(T315I) (IC(50): 63 nmol/L), and most kinase domain mutants. Ex vivo exposure of CML cells from patients harboring BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL(T315I) to DCC-2036 revealed marked inhibition of colony formation and reduced phosphorylation of the direct BCR-ABL target CrkL. Cell-based mutagenesis screens identified a resistance profile for DCC-2036 centered around select P-loop mutations (G250E, Q252H, Y253H, E255K/V), although a concentration of 750 nmol/L DCC-2036 suppressed the emergence of all resistant clones. A decreased concentration of DCC-2036 (160 nmol/L) in dual combination with either nilotinib or dasatinib achieved the same zero outgrowth result. Further screens for resistance due to BCR-ABL compound mutations (two mutations in the same clone) identified BCR-ABL(E255V / T315I) as the most resistant mutant. Taken together, these findings support continued evaluation of DCC-2036 as an important new agent for treatment-refractory CML.","['Eide, Christopher A', 'Adrian, Lauren T', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Mac Partlin, Mary', 'Anderson, David J', 'Wise, Scott C', 'Smith, Bryan D', 'Petillo, Peter A', 'Flynn, Daniel L', 'Deininger, Michael W N', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Druker, Brian J']","['Eide CA', 'Adrian LT', 'Tyner JW', 'Mac Partlin M', 'Anderson DJ', 'Wise SC', 'Smith BD', 'Petillo PA', 'Flynn DL', 'Deininger MW', ""O'Hare T"", 'Druker BJ']","['Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-3224 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3224 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 May 1;71(9):3189-95. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3224.

Like most cancers, AML is a genetically and biologically heterogeneous disease, but it is unclear whether transformation results from common or overlapping genetic programs acting downstream of multiple mutations or by the engagement of unique genetic programs acting cooperatively downstream of individual mutations. This distinction is important, because the involvement of common programs would imply the existence of common molecular targets to treat AML, no matter which oncogenes are involved. Here we show that the ability to promote self-renewal is a generalized property of leukemia-associated oncogenes. Disparate oncogenes initiated overlapping transformation and self-renewal gene expression programs, the common elements of which were defined in established leukemic stem cells from an animal model as well as from a large cohort of patients with differing AML subtypes, where they strongly predicted pathobiological character. Notably, individual genes commonly activated in these programs could partially phenocopy the self-renewal function of leukemia-associated oncogenes in committed murine progenitors.

As these unbalanced rearrangements often combine two recurrent deletions, they could be an efficient mechanism for the loss of two tumor suppressor genes in a single step. We report here that dicentric chromosomes involving chromosome 20 with loss of the 20q12 putative tumor suppressor gene are often the result of more complex rearrangements, with the 20q12 region being lost by an interstitial deletion independent of the site of translocation. We found interstitial deletions of 20q in two thirds of the two-way translocations tested.

In this report, we investigate two apparently balanced translocations, t(6;17)(q23.3;p13.3) and t(2;13)(p21;q14.11), in patients with myeloid neoplasms and uncover concomitant microdeletions associated with the breakpoints. Breakpoint mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected deletions at or adjacent to all breakpoints. Subsequently, array comparative genomic hybridization on the 244 K Agilent platform refined the deletion boundaries, revealing a 1.7 Mb deletion directly adjacent to the 6q23.3 breakpoint, and a 562 kb deletion at 17p13.3 in the first case. The second case was found to harbor a 195 kb deletion at 2p21 and a 1.4 Mb deletion distal to the 13q breakpoint at 13q14.3. Additionally, a 133 kb deletion within the breakpoint region at 13q14.11 and a 265 kb deletion proximal to the breakpoint were discovered, neither of which was detected by FISH. Although a gene fusion resulting from either novel rearrangement cannot be determined from these data, formation of a fusion transcript cannot be excluded because the resolution of the techniques used does not allow definite delineation of the breakpoint locations. Although the incidence and clinical relevance of these focal imbalances remains to be evaluated, the cases presented here support high resolution evaluation of presumably balanced rearrangements in neoplasms. Such imbalances may portend important hitherto unrecognized prognostic and diagnostic categories.","['Poitras, Jennifer L', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Kluk, Michael J', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Lee, Charles', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Morton, Cynthia C']","['Poitras JL', 'Costa D', 'Kluk MJ', 'Amrein PC', 'Stone RM', 'Lee C', 'Dal Cin P', 'Morton CC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(10)00603-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2010.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2011 Feb;204(2):68-76. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2010.12.005.,10.1016/j.cancergen.2010.12.005 [doi],,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a key regulator of HBV that exerts pleiotropic activity on cellular functions. Recent studies showed that HBx alters mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby sensitizing cells to pro-apoptotic signals. However, it remains largely unknown whether susceptibility of hepatocytes could be disturbed by HBx under oxidative stress conditions. The purpose of this study is to determine the apoptotic susceptibility of HBx-expressing hepatocytes upon exposure to pro-oxidant stimuli in vitro and in vivo and explore its underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Although expression of HBx itself did not activate apoptotic signaling, it significantly enhanced oxidative stress-induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, this phenomenon was associated with a pronounced reduction of protein levels of Mcl-1, but not other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members. Importantly, enforced expression of Mcl-1 prevented HBx-triggered cell apoptosis; conversely, specific knockdown of Mcl-1 exacerbated HBx-induced apoptosis upon exposure to oxidative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-3 not only abrogated HBx-triggered apoptotic killing but also blocked HBx-induced Mcl-1 loss. Additionally, expression of HBx and Mcl-1 was found to be inversely correlated in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC) tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that HBx exerts pro-apoptotic effect upon exposure to oxidative stress probably through accelerating the loss of Mcl-1 protein via caspase-3 cascade, which may shed a new light on the molecular mechanism of HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.","['Hu, Liang', 'Chen, Lei', 'Yang, GuangZhen', 'Li, Liang', 'Sun, HanYong', 'Chang, Yanxin', 'Tu, QianQian', 'Wu, MengChao', 'Wang, HongYang']","['Hu L', 'Chen L', 'Yang G', 'Li L', 'Sun H', 'Chang Y', 'Tu Q', 'Wu M', 'Wang H']","['International Co-operation Laboratory on Signal Transduction, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Institute, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-43 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-43 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Apr 20;10:43. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-43.,10.1186/1476-4598-10-43 [doi],20110420,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (hepatitis B virus X protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver/blood supply', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'Warm Ischemia']",,PMC3096594,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the significant success of therapy in breast and ovarian carcinomas with anti-HER2 mAbs as well as in non-Hodkin B cell lymphomas with anti-CD20 mAbs, certain B cell malignancies such as B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) respond poorly to anti-CD20 mAb, due to the low surface expression of this molecule. Thus, new mAbs adapted to each types of tumour will help to develop personalised mAb treatment. To this aim, we analyse the biological and therapeutic properties of three mAbs directed against the CD5, CD71 or HLA-DR molecules highly expressed on B-CLL cells. RESULTS: The three mAbs, after purification and radiolabelling demonstrated high and specific binding capacity to various human leukaemia target cells. Further in vitro analysis showed that mAb anti-CD5 induced neither growth inhibition nor apoptosis, mAb anti-CD71 induced proliferation inhibition with no early sign of cell death and mAb anti-HLA-DR induced specific cell aggregation, but without evidence of apoptosis. All three mAbs induced various degrees of ADCC by NK cells, as well as phagocytosis by macrophages. Only the anti-HLA-DR mAb induced complement mediated lysis. Coincubation of different pairs of mAbs did not significantly modify the in vitro results. In contrast with these discrete and heterogeneous in vitro effects, in vivo the three mAbs demonstrated marked anti-tumour efficacy and prolongation of mice survival in two models of SCID mice, grafted either intraperitoneally or intravenously with the CD5 transfected JOK1-5.3 cells. This cell line was derived from a human hairy cell leukaemia, a type of malignancy known to have very similar biological properties as the B-CLL, whose cells constitutively express CD5. Interestingly, the combined injection of anti-CD5 with anti-HLA-DR or with anti-CD71 led to longer mouse survival, as compared to single mAb injection, up to complete inhibition of tumour growth in 100% mice treated with both anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD5. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether these data suggest that the combined use of two mAbs, such as anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD5, may significantly enhance their therapeutic potential.","['Loisel, Severine', 'Andre, Pierre-Alain', 'Golay, Josee', 'Buchegger, Franz', 'Kadouche, Jean', 'Cerutti, Martine', 'Bologna, Luca', 'Kosinski, Marek', 'Viertl, David', 'Delaloye, Angelika Bischof', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Mach, Jean-Pierre', 'Boumsell, Laurence']","['Loisel S', 'Andre PA', 'Golay J', 'Buchegger F', 'Kadouche J', 'Cerutti M', 'Bologna L', 'Kosinski M', 'Viertl D', 'Delaloye AB', 'Berthou C', 'Mach JP', 'Boumsell L']","['EA2216 and IFR148, University Medical School, Universite Europeenne de Bretagne, F-9238 Brest, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-42 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Apr 19;10:42. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-42.,10.1186/1476-4598-10-42 [doi],20110419,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,PMC3103468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many antibodies have been studied for their potential targeting for hematopoietic malignancies. A few have been proved to be very effective for patients with these diseases. However, more antibodies are needed for clinical use. CD45 and its isoforms may convey clinical potential in terms of targeting therapy. Zhejiang Children's Hospital (ZCH)-6-3A4 (3A4), a novel antibody that can recognize an isoform of CD45 has been found to react with restricted cell components in hematopoietic system, which may have the potential for targeting therapy. Herein, we conducted an in vitro study of our newly prepared antibody 3A4 using various cellular and immunocytological methods. The results showed that the antibody 3A4 (murine IgG1kappa) was a new clone of anti-CD45RA. It could block the binding to an epitope of CD45RA recognized by a standard anti-CD45RA antibody (Clone name L48). The reactivity of the 3A4 to both fresh leukemia cells from patients and well-defined leukemia cell lines was largely similar to those of L48, but the former recognized more leukemia cells than the latter. Cytometric analysis after papain treatment showed that the internalization rate of the 3A4 antibody to the target cells was as high as 71.3% after incubation at 37 degrees C for 4 h, which was significantly higher than that of L48 (20.4%). The norcantharidin (NCTD)-conjugated immunotoxin (NCTD-3A4) was generated using an active ester method. The targeting inhibition rate on KG1a was as high as 61.10% after 96 h incubation in a dose-dependent manner, which was significantly higher than that (3.56%, P < 0.01) with 3A4-negative Nalm-6 cells. In conclusion, our new anti-CD45RA antibody 3A4 is probably a new target molecule of leukemia cells and holds a targeting therapeutic potential for hematopoietic malignancies, which warrants further development of this agent.","['Li, Sisi', 'Tang, Yongmin', 'Zhang, Jingying', 'Guo, Xiaoping', 'Shen, Hongqiang']","['Li S', 'Tang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Guo X', 'Shen H']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, and Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Neonatal Disease, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, P.R.

In addition to cognitive defects, patients with DS also display hematologic disorders and increased incidence of infections and leukemia. Using the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS, the goal of this study was to examine hematopoietic stem and lymphoid progenitor cell function in DS. RESULTS: Analysis of hematopoietic progenitor populations showed that Ts65Dn mice possessed fewer functional hematopoietic stem cells and a significantly decreased percentage of bone marrow lymphoid progenitors. Increased reactive oxygen species and markers of oxidative stress were detected in hematopoietic stem cell populations and were associated with a loss of quiescence. Bone marrow progenitor populations expressed diminished levels of the IL-7Ralpha chain, which was associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Modulating oxidative stress in vitro suggested that oxidative stress selectively leads to decreased IL-7Ralpha expression, and inhibits the survival of IL-7Ralpha-expressing hematopoietic progenitors, potentially linking increased reactive oxygen species and immunopathology. INNOVATION: The study results identify a link between oxidative stress and diminished IL-7Ralpha expression and function. Further, the data suggest that this decrease in IL-7Ralpha is associated with defective hematopoietic development in Down Syndrome. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that hematopoietic stem and lymphoid progenitor cell defects underlie immune dysfunction in DS and that increased oxidative stress and reduced cytokine signaling may alter hematologic development in Ts65Dn mice.","['Lorenzo, Laureanne Pilar E', 'Chen, Haiyan', 'Shatynski, Kristen E', 'Clark, Sarah', 'Yuan, Rong', 'Harrison, David E', 'Yarowsky, Paul J', 'Williams, Mark S']","['Lorenzo LP', 'Chen H', 'Shatynski KE', 'Clark S', 'Yuan R', 'Harrison DE', 'Yarowsky PJ', 'Williams MS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 800 W.

Because of the overall poor prognosis, new treatment strategies for lung cancer patients are urgently needed, and targeting CXCR4 constitutes such a novel, attractive strategy. Tumor cell migration and metastasis share many similarities with leukocyte trafficking, which is critically regulated by chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules. Lung cancer cells express CXCR4 (CD184), a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor. Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment constitutively secrete stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), the ligand for CXCR4. Activation of CXCR4 induces lung cancer cell migration and adhesion to stromal cells, which in turn provides growth- and drug-resistance signals to the tumor cells. CXCR4 antagonists, such as Plerixafor (AMD3100) and T140 analogues (TN14003/BKT140), can disrupt CXCR4-mediated tumor cell adhesion to stromal cells and sensitize lung cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, targeting the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is a novel, attractive therapeutic approach in small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. In this article, we summarize data about the cellular and molecular microenvironment in small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer, as well as the role of CXCR4 in tumor-stroma crosstalk. In addition, we review the current status of the preclinical and clinical development of CXCR4 antagonists.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Stewart, David J', 'Wald, Ori', 'Peled, Amnon']","['Burger JA', 'Stewart DJ', 'Wald O', 'Peled A']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, PO Box 301402, Houston, TX 77230-1402, USA. jaburger@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/08/11 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/era.11.11 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2011 Apr;11(4):621-30. doi: 10.1586/era.11.11.,10.1586/era.11.11 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (TN14003)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzylamines', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Cyclams', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Peptides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoglobulin gene (IG) status is preserved in the neoplastic B cell clone and can provide an indicator of the maturation stage reached by the B cell prior to transformation. In hairy cell leukemia (HCL), several data from IG analysis provide clear hints regarding the cell of origin and the ongoing selective interactions of the tumor BCR with environmental stimuli: HCLs (i) have variable levels of IG somatic mutations, (ii) continue somatic mutations at low levels, (iii) have active processes of IG class switching after transformation, and (iv) have a relatively high frequency of selective events in the light chain of the BCR. It has recently emerged that an unmutated status of the HCL-derived IG can be associated with failure to respond to cladribine, genetic abnormalities indicative of poor outcome, and aggressive disease. These observations suggest that IG gene analysis may have biological and prognostic relevance in HCL and merits further characterization.","['Forconi, Francesco', 'Cencini, Emanuele', 'Sozzi, Elisa', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Raspadori, Donatella', 'Lauria, Francesco']","['Forconi F', 'Cencini E', 'Sozzi E', 'Sicuranza A', 'Raspadori D', 'Lauria F']","['Sezione di Ematologia e Trapianti, Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Scienze Immunologiche, Universita di Siena & AOUS, Siena, Italy. forconif@unisi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.569620 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52 Suppl 2:103-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.569620.

We reviewed retrospectively data from 18 patients who were retreated with either pentostatin (n = 12) or cladribine (n = 6) in combination with rituximab, after 1-6 (median 2) previous treatments with either purine analog as a single agent. All 18 patients responded to therapy, with a complete response (CR) rate of 89%. This compared favorably with CR rates of 68% after second-line therapy and 47% after third-line therapy in 88 patients retreated one or more times with a purine analog alone. Toxicity with the combination treatment was minimal. At a median follow-up of 36 months (range 5-83 months) all 16 complete responders remained in CR, while one partial responder developed recurrent disease at 10 months. The estimated recurrence rate at 3 years was 7%. This compares with 21% after second-line therapy and 42% after third-line therapy in the 88 patients retreated with a purine analog alone. Furthermore, it was a marked improvement on the 55% recurrence at 3 years previously seen in these same 18 patients after their own first-line treatment with single-agent pentostatin or cladribine (p = 0.006).

Moxetumomab pasudotox (previously called CAT-8015 or HA22) contains an anti-CD22 Fv fused to PE38, a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin, containing amino acids 253-364 and 381-613. One avenue to reducing immunogenicity is to identify B- and T-cell epitopes and remove them while retaining toxin activity. To determine B-cell epitopes on PE38, 60 monoclonal antibodies against PE38 were tested in a pairwise manner, and seven major epitope groups with 13 subgroups were identified. The locations of many of these epitopes were identified by mutating large surface-exposed residues to alanine. A mutant of moxetumomab pasudotox containing eight epitope-eliminating mutations (HA22-8X) was prepared, and greatly reduced immunogenicity in mice. In parallel, two large sections of PE38 containing lysosomal protease cleavage sites were removed, leaving only amino acids 274-284 and 394-613 of the toxin. The resulting molecule, HA22-LR, retained cytotoxicity toward CD22+ cell lines, killed primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells more potently than moxetumomab pasudotox, was much less toxic to mice, and had significantly improved antitumor activity toward murine xenografts. The immunogenicity and activity of recombinant immunotoxins may be optimized by combinations of these approaches.","['Pastan, Ira', 'Onda, Masanori', 'Weldon, John', 'Fitzgerald, David', 'Kreitman, Robert']","['Pastan I', 'Onda M', 'Weldon J', 'Fitzgerald D', 'Kreitman R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.573039 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52 Suppl 2:87-90. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.573039.

Subsequently cladribine has been administered intravenously, as a 2 h infusion for 5 consecutive days or weekly for 7 weeks, or subcutaneously.

Overall responses have been no different in the two arms, while a much lower infection rate was observed when cladribine was given at the lowest dose.

This article reviews the pharmacological properties, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of lenograstim, mainly focusing on its use in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, acceleration of neutrophil recovery following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization in patients with cancer and healthy donors. In randomized, multicentre trials in patients with solid tumours, lymphoma or multiple myeloma, the durations of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, hospitalization for infection and intravenous antibacterial therapy were significantly shorter in patients receiving lenograstim prophylaxis than in those receiving placebo. The time to neutrophil recovery was also significantly shorter in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who received lenograstim than in those who received placebo or no treatment, according to the results of randomized, multicentre trials. In addition, lenograstim prophylaxis facilitated the administration of dose-intense or dose-dense chemotherapy regimens, with improved clinical outcomes seen in some trials. In patients with cancer undergoing HSCT, lenograstim accelerated neutrophil recovery post-HSCT and shortened the duration of hospitalization, according to the results of randomized, multicentre trials. Lenograstim effectively mobilized PBSCs in patients with cancer, demonstrating generally similar efficacy to filgrastim or molgramostim in five randomized trials (although lower dosages of lenograstim than filgrastim were administered in four of the trials). Lenograstim also provided effective PBSC mobilization in healthy donors and was more effective than filgrastim when both drugs were administered at a dosage of 10 mug/kg/day. The efficacy and safety of lenograstim for PBSC mobilization in healthy donors was supported by the results of a prospective, longer-term study involving almost 4000 healthy donors. Lenograstim was generally well tolerated across a variety of treatment settings, including PBSC mobilization in healthy donors, with bone pain being one of the most commonly reported adverse events. In conclusion, lenograstim remains an important option for use in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, acceleration of neutrophil recovery following HSCT, and PBSC mobilization.","['Keating, Gillian M']",['Keating GM'],"['Adis, a Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,2011/04/21 06:00,2011/08/23 06:00,['2011/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['2 [pii]', '10.2165/11206870-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2011 Apr 16;71(6):679-707. doi: 10.2165/11206870-000000000-00000.,10.2165/11206870-000000000-00000 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasms/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic mutations in all four genes have recently been implicated in aberrant DNA methylation, a hallmark of neoplasia. We previously reported that IDH1 mutations were absent, whereas TET2 mutations were present in 6%, of pediatric AML patients; in the present study, we determined the prevalence of DNMT3A and IDH2 mutations in pediatric AML. METHODS: We screened for DNMT3A and IDH2 mutations by direct sequencing of diagnostic specimens from 180 children treated on the Children's Oncology Group clinical trial AAML03P1. Clinical characteristics, the presence of other leukemic mutations, and survival outcome was determined for mutation-positive patients. RESULTS: No disease-associated DNMT3A mutations were detected. IDH2 mutations were detected in 4/180 patients (2.2%), affecting codons R140 (n = 3) and R172 (n = 1). Two patients with IDH2 mutations harbored t(8;21), one patient harbored an MLL translocation, and one patient had a concomitant NPM1 mutation. FLT3, CEBPA, and WT1 mutations did not occur together with IDH2 mutations in our study. CONCLUSION: DNMT3A and IDH2 mutations are uncommon in pediatric AML. The low prevalence of methylation-associated mutations in our study highlights the differences in the pathogenesis of pediatric versus adult AML, at the genetic as well as potentially at the epigenetic level. The age-specific characteristics of AML underscore the importance of studying the molecular biology of both childhood and adult forms of this leukemia in parallel, as the development of novel therapeutics should account for these biologic differences.","['Ho, Phoenix A', 'Kutny, Matthew A', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Joaquin, Jason', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Ho PA', 'Kutny MA', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Joaquin J', 'Raimondi SC', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA. pho@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23179 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Aug;57(2):204-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23179.

For example, mitochondrial Ca(2+) (Ca(mit)(2+)) regulates apoptosis, whereas Ca(2+) in the nucleus regulates cell proliferation. Because apoptosis and cell growth can be related, we investigated whether Ca(mit)(2+) also affects liver regeneration. The Ca(2+)-buffering protein parvalbumin, which was targeted to the mitochondrial matrix and fused to green fluorescent protein, was expressed in the SKHep1 liver cell line; the vector was called parvalbumin-mitochondrial targeting sequence-green fluorescent protein (PV-MITO-GFP). This construct properly localized to and effectively buffered Ca(2+) signals in the mitochondrial matrix. Additionally, the expression of PV-MITO-GFP reduced apoptosis induced by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The reduction in cell death correlated with the increased expression of antiapoptotic genes [B cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia 1, and B cell lymphoma extra large] and with the decreased expression of proapoptotic genes [p53, B cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (bax), apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1, and caspase-6]. PV-MITO-GFP was also expressed in hepatocytes in vivo with an adenoviral delivery system. Ca(mit)(2+) buffering in hepatocytes accelerated liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, and this effect was associated with the increased expression of bcl-2 and the decreased expression of bax. CONCLUSION: Together, these results reveal an essential role for Ca(mit)(2+) in hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration, which may be mediated by the regulation of apoptosis.","['Guerra, Mateus T', 'Fonseca, Emerson A', 'Melo, Flavia M', 'Andrade, Viviane A', 'Aguiar, Carla J', 'Andrade, Lidia M', 'Pinheiro, Ana Cristina N', 'Casteluber, Marisa C F', 'Resende, Rodrigo R', 'Pinto, Mauro C X', 'Fernandes, Simone O A', 'Cardoso, Valbert N', 'Souza-Fagundes, Elaine M', 'Menezes, Gustavo B', 'de Paula, Ana M', 'Nathanson, Michael H', 'Leite, Maria de Fatima']","['Guerra MT', 'Fonseca EA', 'Melo FM', 'Andrade VA', 'Aguiar CJ', 'Andrade LM', 'Pinheiro AC', 'Casteluber MC', 'Resende RR', 'Pinto MC', 'Fernandes SO', 'Cardoso VN', 'Souza-Fagundes EM', 'Menezes GB', 'de Paula AM', 'Nathanson MH', 'Leite Mde F']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.24367 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2011 Jul;54(1):296-306. doi: 10.1002/hep.24367.,10.1002/hep.24367 [doi],,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Liver Regeneration/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*metabolism', 'Models, Animal', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']","['R01 DK045710-10/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK045710-06A2/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK057751-10/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK045710/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK057751-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK034989/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK034989-26/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK57751/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK34989/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'DK45710/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK034989-25S1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK057751/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3125477,['Copyright (c) 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],,,['NIHMS288228'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 3,873 patients with chronic liver disease who were seen consecutively in the Liver Disease Outpatient Clinic between January 2001 and July 2007 were assessed retrospectively. The frequency of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in these patients was investigated. Of the total, 1,999 patients had chronic hepatitis B infection (male/female: 1,226/773, mean age: 45.1 +/- 13.2 years), 978 had chronic hepatitis C infection (male/female: 437/541, mean age: 53.8 +/- 13.7 years), and the remaining 896 had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (male/female: 450/446, mean age: 50.8 +/- 11.2 years). A malignant lymphoproliferative disorder was identified in 13 patients (male/female: 9/4, mean age: 52.8 +/- 16.8 years) with chronic viral hepatitis, while no case of malignant lymphoproliferative disorder was identified in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (P = 0.048). Among the patients with malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, seven had chronic hepatitis B infection and six had chronic hepatitis C infection; 11 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and two had chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Seventy-four metastatic colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin/floropyrimidine-based first line therapy have been included in this retrospective study. PML expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. PML down-regulation was detected in 39 (52.7%) patients (14 complete and 25 partial PML loss). RR was significantly lower (25.6%) in patients with PML down-regulation than in patients with preserved PML expression (60%) (P = 0.006). Median TTP was 5.5 months when PML was down-regulated versus 11.9 months in case of preserved PML expression (P < 0.0001). A statistical significant difference was also detected in OS (15.6 and 24.5 months, respectively, P = 0.003).

The hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) is often found dysregulated in preleukemic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Physiological substrates of HePTP include the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2 and p38. Specific modulators of HePTP catalytic activity will be useful for elucidating mechanisms of MAPK regulation in hematopietic cells, and may also provide treatments for hematopoietic malignancies such as AML. Here we report the discovery of phenoxyacetic acids as inhibitors of HePTP. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis and in silico docking studies reveal the molecular basis of HePTP inhibition by these compounds.

Unfortunately, late presentation and delayed diagnosis of childhood cancers remains a problem in developing countries. OBJECTIVES: To describe the pre-diagnostic symptomatic intervals and the factors influencing these time intervals in childhood cancer at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: Information was obtained from the case notes of children seen between March 2006 and August 2008. Information included socio-demographic variables, stage of the cancer, duration of illness at diagnosis and other health seeking activities. RESULTS: Sixty-four children (40 males, 24 females) were studied. Median overall lag time was 13.1 weeks; median parent delay was 2 weeks and median health system delay was 8.8 weeks. Median lag times were shortest in acute leukaemia (8.1 weeks) and Wilms. tumour (8.7 weeks) and longest in Hodgkin lymphoma (101.7 weeks). CONCLUSION: Lag times were longer than those in developed countries. Factors contributing to delayed diagnosis included delayed referral by doctors, seeking health care from alternate sources and financial constraints. Education of parents and physicians on early presentation and early referral for early diagnosis is recommended.","['Brown, B J', 'Ajayi, S O', 'Ogun, O A', 'Oladokun, R E']","['Brown BJ', 'Ajayi SO', 'Ogun OA', 'Oladokun RE']","['Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan. bawojames@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Uganda,Afr Health Sci,African health sciences,101149451,2009/12/01 00:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Afr Health Sci. 2009 Dec;9(4):247-53.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Child, Preschool', '*Delayed Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis', 'Nigeria', 'Referral and Consultation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program/*statistics & numerical data', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors']",['D43 TW009112/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3074401,,,,,,,"['Afr Health Sci. 2010 Jun;10(2):137.

We studied APL patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2006 in the population-based Swedish Adult Acute Leukemia Registry.

The median age at the time of diagnosis was 54 years; 62% were female and 38% male. Among younger APL patients, female sex predominated (89% of patients <40 years). Of the 105 APL patients, 30 (29%) died within 30 days (that is, early death (ED)) (median 4 days) and 28 (26%) within 14 days from diagnosis. In all, 41% of the EDs were due to hemorrhage; 35% of ED patients never received all-trans-retinoic acid treatment. ED rates increased with age but more clearly with poor performance status. ED was also associated with high white blood cells, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, C-reactive protein and low platelet count. Of non-ED patients, 97% achieved complete remission of which 16% subsequently relapsed. In total, 62% are still alive at 6.4 years median follow-up.

We recently reported that overexpression of miR-21 and/or miR-155 leads to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway in malignant lymphomas expressing CD3(-)CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cell antigen. Through expression analysis, we show in this study that in both NK/T-cell lymphoma lines and samples of primary lymphoma, levels of miR-150 expression are significantly lower than in normal NK cells. To examine its role in lymphomagenesis, we transduced miR-150 into NK/T-cell lymphoma cells, which increased the incidence of apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, the miR-150 transductants appeared senescent and showed lower telomerase activity, resulting in shortened telomeric DNA. We also found that miR-150 directly downregulated expression of DKC1 and AKT2, reduced levels of phosphorylated AKT(ser473/4) and increased levels of tumor suppressors such as Bim and p53. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-150 functions as a tumor suppressor, and that its aberrant downregulation induces continuous activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, leading to telomerase activation and immortalization of cancer cells. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of malignant lymphoma.","['Watanabe, A', 'Tagawa, H', 'Yamashita, J', 'Teshima, K', 'Nara, M', 'Iwamoto, K', 'Kume, M', 'Kameoka, Y', 'Takahashi, N', 'Nakagawa, T', 'Shimizu, N', 'Sawada, K']","['Watanabe A', 'Tagawa H', 'Yamashita J', 'Teshima K', 'Nara M', 'Iwamoto K', 'Kume M', 'Kameoka Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Nakagawa T', 'Shimizu N', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201181 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.81 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1324-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.81.

We detected ERbeta expression in murine T- and human B-cell lymphoma cell lines and analyzed the effects of estradiol and selective ERbeta agonists on lymphoma growth in culture and in vivo. Treating the cells with estradiol had minor effects on cell growth, whereas the selective ERbeta agonists diarylpropionitrile (DPN) and KB9520 showed a strong antiproliferative effect. When grafting mice with murine T-cell lymphoma cells, male mice developed larger tumors compared with female mice, a difference that was abolished following ovariectomy, showing estrogen-dependent growth in vivo. To investigate whether lymphoma growth may be inhibited in vivo by ERbeta agonist treatment, mice grafted with murine lymphoma cells were treated with DPN or KB9520. Both ERbeta-selective agonists strongly inhibited lymphoma growth. The reduced tumor size seen following either DPN or KB9520 treatment was due to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Our results show an ERbeta ligand-dependent antiproliferative effect of lymphoma cells expressing endogenous ERbeta and that lymphoma cell growth in vivo can efficiently be inhibited by ERbeta agonists. This suggests that ERbeta agonists may be useful in the treatment of lymphomas.","['Yakimchuk, K', 'Iravani, M', 'Hasni, M S', 'Rhonnstad, P', 'Nilsson, S', 'Jondal, M', 'Okret, S']","['Yakimchuk K', 'Iravani M', 'Hasni MS', 'Rhonnstad P', 'Nilsson S', 'Jondal M', 'Okret S']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Novum, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201168 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jul;25(7):1103-10. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.68.

How this opposed methylation modification is accomplished and coordinated in mammalian cells is poorly understood. Here we report that the H3K9 trimethyl demethylase JMJD2B is an integral component of the H3K4-specific methyltransferase, the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) 2 complex. We show that the JMJD2B/MLL2 complex is copurified with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and is required for ERalpha-regulated transcription. We demonstrate that H3K9 demethylation and H3K4 methylation are coordinated in ERalpha-activated transcription such that H3K9 demethylation is a prerequisite for H3K4 methylation. Significantly, depletion of JMJD2B impairs the estrogen-induced G(1)/S transition of the cell cycle in vitro and inhibits breast tumorigenesis in vivo. Interestingly, JMJD2B itself is an ERalpha target gene, and forms a feed-forward regulatory loop in regulation of the hormone response. Our results provide a molecular basis for the coordinated H3K4 methylation/H3K9 demethylation in transcription activation, link the trimethyl demethylase JMJD2B to euchromatin functions, and provide a mechanism for JMJD2B in breast carcinogenesis.","['Shi, Lei', 'Sun, Luyang', 'Li, Qian', 'Liang, Jing', 'Yu, Wenhua', 'Yi, Xia', 'Yang, Xiaohan', 'Li, Yanyan', 'Han, Xiao', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Xuan, Chenghao', 'Yao, Zhi', 'Shang, Yongfeng']","['Shi L', 'Sun L', 'Li Q', 'Liang J', 'Yu W', 'Yi X', 'Yang X', 'Li Y', 'Han X', 'Zhang Y', 'Xuan C', 'Yao Z', 'Shang Y']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1017374108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1017374108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 May 3;108(18):7541-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1017374108.

These findings were compared with immunohistochemical findings for CD68 (KP-1), CD34, and CD163 and were also correlated with flow cytometric and enzyme cytochemical results. CD163 and CD14 are the most specific markers of monocytic differentiation, followed by KLF4. CD68, in contrast, is the most sensitive monocytic marker, and KLF4 is also significantly more sensitive than CD14 and CD163.

Moreover, the pure drug ((99m)Tc-Eto) did not cross the blood-brain barrier, whereas (99m)Tc-Eto-PLGA NP(105) showed relatively high concentrations of 0.58% of injected dose in brain in 1 h (8-fold higher), 0.6% in 4 h (20-fold higher) and 0.22% in 24 h (10-fold higher) than the concentration of (99m)Tc-Eto-PLGA NP(160). In bone, concentration of (99m)Tc-Eto-PLGA NP(105) was about 7.2 times higher than the concentration of (99m)Tc-Eto in 24 h. The study concludes that NPs of size approximately 100 nm can be used for long-term circulation without the need for surface modification. Such NPs could be exploited for use in leukemia therapy for providing sustained release of etoposide by long-term circulation. LAY ABSTRACT: Approaches used to avoid uptake of the injected particles by the reticuloendothelial system include modification of the particle properties such as surface charge and particle size. In the present study the effect of mean particle size of etoposide-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) of sizes 105 nm and 160 nm on biodistribution studies after intravenous administration in mice and blood clearance studies after intravenous administration in rats was studied. It was found that etoposide-loaded PLGA-NPs of size 105 nm were present in the blood at higher concentrations up to 24 h and were able to reduce their uptake by the reticuloendothelial system as compared to that of etoposide-loaded PLGA-NP of size 160 nm and pure drug. Moreover, the NPs of size 105 nm had greater uptake in bone and brain, in which concentration of free drug and NPs of size 160 nm was negligible. The study concludes that NPs of size approximately 100 nm can be used for long-term circulation without the need for surface modification.","['Yadav, Khushwant S', 'Chuttani, Krishna', 'Mishra, Anil K', 'Sawant, Krutika K']","['Yadav KS', 'Chuttani K', 'Mishra AK', 'Sawant KK']","['TIFAC-Centre of Relevance and Excellence in NDDS, Pharmacy Department, The M.

PML was first identified as the gene participating in the translocation responsible for the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The notion that PML is a tumor suppressor gene was soon extrapolated from leukemia to solid tumors. The last decade has radically changed the view of how this tumor suppressor is regulated, how it can be therapeutically targeted, and how it functions. Notably, one of the most recent and striking features uncovered is how PML regulates cellular homeostasis outside its original niche in the nucleus.

However, the mechanism of regulation of DR6 expression in cells of the immune system is not fully understood. In this communication we show that DR6 is not expressed in resting T cells from human peripheral blood or murine lymph nodes but that its expression is significantly upregulated in CD3 crosslinking- or PMA/ionomycin-activated T lymphocytes. DR6 expression is transiently increased in both activated human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and it is apparently dependent on the activation of NF-kappaB and NF-AT signaling pathways. In contrast to primary peripheral blood T cells, the widely used model lymphoblastic leukemia T-cell line Jurkat is DR6-positive and unexpectedly, TCR-mediated stimulation of Jurkat cells strongly downregulates DR6 expression via suppression of its transcription.","['Klima, Martin', 'Brouckova, Adela', 'Koc, Michal', 'Andera, Ladislav']","['Klima M', 'Brouckova A', 'Koc M', 'Andera L']","['Laboratory of Cell Signaling and Apoptosis, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/08/11 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(11)00115-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2011.03.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2011 Jul;48(12-13):1439-47. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2011.03.021.

The fluorinated beta-ketoamine ligands were prepared utilizing a multistep reaction sequence employing a silylenol protecting group. An additional tetrahedral cobalt compound bearing two bidentate beta-ketoaminato ligands was also prepared and characterized. Cytotoxic activity of the cobalt-containing complexes was evaluated using six human cell lines; including two different prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and VCaP), acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1), astrocytoma (U-373 MG), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. The cobalt compounds are more active than their corresponding ligands. The activity is cell type specific; the cobalt compounds exhibit strong activity against human prostate cancer and monocytic leukemia cells but weak or no activity against neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, and liver carcinoma cells. Activity generally increases with a greater number of -CF(3) substituents, and square planar complexes exhibit greater activity than the tetrahedral derivative. The mechanisms of activity against human PC-3 prostate cancer cells involve caspase-3 and two different mitogen-activated protein kinases. The addition of a thiol antioxidant reduced cytotoxicity, suggesting the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species.

Their expression deregulations were described in association with pathogenesis of some hematological malignancies. This study provides integrated microRNA expression profiling at different phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the aim to identify microRNAs associated with CML pathogenesis. The functions of in silico filtered targets are in this report annotated and discussed in relation to CML pathogenesis. RESULTS: Using microarrays we identified differential expression profiles of 49 miRNAs in CML patients at diagnosis, in hematological relapse, therapy failure, blast crisis and major molecular response. The expression deregulation of miR-150, miR-20a, miR-17, miR-19a, miR-103, miR-144, miR-155, miR-181a, miR-221 and miR-222 in CML was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. In silico analyses identified targeted genes of these miRNAs encoding proteins that are involved in cell cycle and growth regulation as well as several key signaling pathways such as of mitogen activated kinase-like protein (MAPK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ERBB), transforming growth factor beta (TGFB1) and tumor protein p53 that are all related to CML. Decreased levels of miR-150 were detected in patients at diagnosis, in blast crisis and 67% of hematological relapses and showed significant negative correlation with miR-150 proved target MYB and with BCR-ABL transcript level. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers microRNAs that are potentially involved in CML and the annotated functions of in silico filtered targets of selected miRNAs outline mechanisms whereby microRNAs may be involved in CML pathogenesis.","['Machova Polakova, Katerina', 'Lopotova, Tereza', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Burda, Pavel', 'Trneny, Marek', 'Stopka, Tomas', 'Moravcova, Jana']","['Machova Polakova K', 'Lopotova T', 'Klamova H', 'Burda P', 'Trneny M', 'Stopka T', 'Moravcova J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-41 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Apr 18;10:41. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-41.,10.1186/1476-4598-10-41 [doi],20110418,"['0 (MIRN150 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Cluster Analysis', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, myb/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,PMC3102634,,,,,,,,,['GEO/GSE26260'],,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the nucleus undergoes significant remodelling during viral usurpation or exploitation.

Considerable research effort has identified the signal transduction pathways in CLL cells that contribute to anti-apoptotic signalling. Some pathways are constitutively activated in CLL cells but upregulated in normal cells only when protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are activated by ligands. This review describes which PTKs are aberrantly activated in CLL cells and are potential targets for inhibition. Additional potential targets within pathways downstream of these PTKs include Mek/Erk, mTorc1, protein kinase C, PI-3 kinase/Akt, nuclear factor-kappaB and cyclin-dependent protein kinase. Numerous studies have identified chemical agents and antibodies that selectively kill CLL cells, irrespective of their genetic resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, and which can overcome cytoprotective microenvironmental signalling. These studies have resulted in identification of novel therapies, some of which are currently undergoing clinical trials. In vitro and animal model studies and clinical trials could determine which inhibitors of which targets are the likely to be most effective and least toxic either singly or in combination.","['Wickremasinghe, R Gitendra', 'Prentice, Archibald G', 'Steele, Andrew J']","['Wickremasinghe RG', 'Prentice AG', 'Steele AJ']","['Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, University College Hospital Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08676.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jun;153(5):545-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08676.x.

Treatment of elderly patients with intensive chemotherapy is associated with high treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, less toxic approaches involving low-dose decitabine-based regimens are being explored in this patient population. AREAS COVERED: This drug evaluation article discusses the rationale for targeting aberrant DNA methylation in hematologic malignancies, in particular the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML. The authors review the pharmacokinetic data gained from low-dose decitabine, as well as the clinical progress of decitabine in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Published manuscripts in English were selected from PubMed using a combination of the following search terms: acute myeloid leukemia, pharmacokinetics, decitabine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, DNA methylation, DNA methyltransferase, myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. EXPERT OPINION: Decitabine has established efficacy in MDS and shown promising activity in AML at low doses. Given decitabine's favorable toxicity profile and emerging clinical efficacy, decitabine may be a low intensity therapeutic option for elderly patients with AML who are considered unfit for aggressive chemotherapy.","['Bryan, Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Bryan J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour E']","['The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,2011/04/20 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2011/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17425255.2011.575062 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2011 May;7(5):661-72. doi: 10.1517/17425255.2011.575062.,10.1517/17425255.2011.575062 [doi],,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/physiopathology']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Recombinant HSV-I plasmids (HSV-UL38P-GALV.fus, HSV-CMVP-GALV.fus, HSV-CMVP-EGFP) was introduced into green monkey kidney cells (Vero) by liposome to amplify the virus, which were propagated in Vero cells and purified by cesium chloride density purification, titrated by TCID50 method. The three recombinant viruses were named as Synco-2, Synco-1 and Baco-1 respectively, and were transfected into lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 cell and human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts which were established in nude mice subcutaneously to observe the expression and transfection of recombinant plasmids; mice model was divided to A (Control) group, B (Baco-1) group, C (Synco-1) group, D (Synco-2) group and E (Synco-2) group. The antitumor and cytotoxic effects of the virus in vitro or in vivo were investigated simultaneously. RESULTS: Recombinated HSV-I virus were packed successfully, the titre of Baco-1, Synco-1 and Synco-2 were 3 x 10(10) pfu/mL, 1X 10(11) pfu/mL and 4 x 10(10) pfu/mL respectively. The virus produced clear antitumor effects in vitro, the oncolytic activity of Synco-2 and Synco-1 was superior to that of Baco-1 (P < 0.01). The striking antitumor effect was seen when the virus was given subcutaneously in established xenografts in the animals. Tumor volume in Group C and D decreased significantly compared those in Group A and B (P < 0.01). The same result was observed in tumour weight (P < 0.01), and we also find that there was statistical significance between Group C and D in tumour quality at last two weeks (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The three recombinant HSV-I were packaged, amplificated and purified successfully. Recombinant GALV. fus gene system controlled by special promoter and mediated by available carrier has potent activity against lung cancer both in vitro or in vivo, and maybe a new promising candidate for investigative gene therapy of this malignancy.","['Zhu, Mice', 'Yang, Jian-ru', 'Jiang, Yue-quan', 'Chen, Shi-feng', 'Fu, Xin-ping', 'Tian, Ze-dan']","['Zhu M', 'Yang JR', 'Jiang YQ', 'Chen SF', 'Fu XP', 'Tian ZD']","['Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

The spectrum of cancer susceptibility in this group of disorders has not been studied in detail. We identified more than 1900 cases of NS, CS, CFCS, or NSML reported in the literature between 1937 and 2010; 88 cancers were reported. The most common cancers reported in 1051 NS subjects were neuroblastoma (n = 8), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 8), low grade glioma (n = 6), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 6). These associations are biologically plausible, given that somatic RAS pathway mutations are known to occur in these specific cancers. In addition, 40 childhood cases of myeloproliferative disease were described in individuals with NS, several of whom experienced a benign course of this hematologic condition. We confirmed the previously described association between CS and cancer in 268 reported individuals: 19 had rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 had bladder cancer, and 5 had neuroblastoma. By age 20, the cumulative incidence of cancer was approximately 4% for NS and 15% for CS; both syndromes had a cancer incidence peak in childhood. The cancers described in CFCS and NSML overlapped with those reported in NS and CS.

The molecular basis for this difference in prognosis is not known. We examined the 13q14 and 11q22-23 minimally deleted regions (MDRs) for differentially expressed genes by analyzing 154 microarray CLL gene expression data sets. We were able to generate a detailed gene expression map of the MDRs demonstrating a gene dosage effect. Surprisingly, ARHGAP20 encoding the RHO GTPase activating protein 20, which is located in the 11q22-23 MDR, showed-counterintuitively-a significantly higher expression in cases with 11q22-23 deletions compared with cases with no detectable genetic lesion or trisomy 12. Interestingly, cases with 13q14 deletions also had higher ARHGAP20 expression. These expression level changes were confirmed by quantitative PCR in 110 additional CLL samples. The ARHGAP20 gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein. In the zebra fish (Danio rerio) genome the syntenic regions of human chromosomal bands 13q14 and 11q22-23 are juxtaposed.

Ceramide is a bioactive sphingolipid that regulates many signaling pathways, including cell growth and proliferation, senescence and quiescence, apoptosis, and cell cycle. Ceramides are generated by longevity assurance genes (LASS). Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) and sphingosine kinase-1 (SK-1) enzymes can convert ceramides to antiapoptotic molecules, glucosylceramide, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, respectively. C8:ceramide, an important cell-permeable analogue of natural ceramides, increases intracellular ceramide levels significantly, while 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and SK-1 inhibitor increase accumulation of ceramides by inhibiting GCS and SK-1, respectively. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematological disorder resulting from generation of BCR/ABL oncogene. In this study, we examined the roles of ceramide metabolizing genes in resveratrol-induced apoptosis in K562 CML cells. There were synergistic cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of resveratrol with coadministration of C8:ceramide, PDMP, and SK-1 inhibitor. Interestingly, there were also significant increases in expression levels of LASS genes and decreases in expression levels of GCS and SK-1 in K562 cells in response to resveratrol.

Ionizing radiation damages normal brain parenchyma through a variety of poorly understood mechanisms and results in cognitive dysfunction and significant life-long disability. The goal of our study was to establish and characterize a mouse model of radiation-induced damage to the developing nervous system. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a total dose of 20 Gy of fractionated cranial irradiation at 1 month of age to assess the early and late effects of clinically relevant irradiation doses on the young mouse brain. Compared to age-matched controls, an acute and prolonged decrease in proliferation and the number of immature neurons in the stem cell niche of the hippocampal subgranular zone within the dentate gyrus at 72 h and 1 month following cranial irradiation was noted. Behavioral characterization at 1 and 5 months post-radiation demonstrated significant, persistent and progressive hippocampus-dependent learning deficits. Our study characterizes a clinically relevant mouse model of radiation-induced damage that serves as a platform for future evaluation of therapeutic interventions that may mitigate such cognitive damage. Our research also emphasizes the need for targeted treatment strategies that protect regions of neurogenesis while maximizing therapeutic effects in pediatric cancer patients.","['Rao, Amulya A Nageswara', 'Ye, Hong', 'Decker, Paul A', 'Howe, Charles L', 'Wetmore, Cynthia']","['Rao AA', 'Ye H', 'Decker PA', 'Howe CL', 'Wetmore C']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,2011/04/19 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-011-0582-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2011 Nov;105(2):191-8. doi: 10.1007/s11060-011-0582-9.

Here, we have studied the mechanism of this defective expression of PVR. We demonstrated that the characterization of NK-insensitive cell lines was of low expression of PVR in both mRNA and surface levels, and that PVR of RAJI cells able to resist NK cells has hypermethylated promoter-associated CpG islands. After treating with 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) (ie, hypomethylation agent) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (ie, histone deacetylase inhibitor), respectively or simultaneously, the abnormal epigenetic status became partly reversed, and the mRNA and surface expression of PVR restored. The expression restoration of the gene enhanced susceptibility of RAJI cells to NK cells but, when the RAJI cells were incubated with the specific blocking antibody for PVR's receptor, the enhanced susceptibility would diminish. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia expressed higher PVR than patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in both mRNA and surface levels. Epigenetic modulation of hypermethylation and histone deacetylase is involved in repressing PVR expression in malignant lymphocytes resistant to NK cells.","['Wang, Wei', 'Gao, Li', 'Wang, Xinrong', 'Kang, Huiyuan', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Wang, Lili', 'Yu, Li']","['Wang W', 'Gao L', 'Wang X', 'Kang H', 'Li Y', 'Wang L', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3182188017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2011 May;34(4):353-61. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3182188017.,10.1097/CJI.0b013e3182188017 [doi],,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (poliovirus receptor)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/immunology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An immunotherapeutic approach that enhances the graft versus leukemia effect may improve their survival. We postulate that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated from total RNA loaded cord blood CD34+-derived dendritic cells can control the kinetics of leukemic growth in a nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mouse model of human ALL. CD34+-derived dendritic cells electroporated with total RNA from an ALL xenograft generate antileukemic CTL with specificity for the ALL xenograft while sparing autologous cord blood mononuclear cells. The CD3+ T-cell compartment of the CTL was dominated by CD4+ T cells, although CD8+ T cells accounted for an average of 30% of the CD3+ T cells present. Expansion of both CD4+ and CD8+ memory and terminal effector memory subsets from predominantly naive cells was evident. Natural killer (NK) cells accounted for an average of 13% of the final antitumor lymphoid cells produced. Blocking experiments confirmed that the CD8+ T-cell compartment was responsible for the antileukemic activity of the polyclonal CTL pool. Administration of antileukemic CTL to NOD-SCID mice bearing ALL xenograft cells was able to delay, but not prevent the growth of ALL in vivo. Coadministration of antigen-loaded antigen-presenting cells did not further improve upon the delay in ALL engraftment kinetics observed with CTL alone. The efficacy of adoptively transferred polyclonal CTL can be improved with coadministration of recombinant human interleukin-2. However, in NOD-SCID mice, the efficacy of these adoptively transferred cells is masked by interleukin-2 stimulation of murine NK cells, which facilitate killing of ALL cells. Our data highlights the role for NK cells in antileukemic responses posttransplant. Collectively, our results support the notion that ALL-specific adoptive immunotherapy could be used clinically and provide an alternative strategy for preventing and treating disease relapse posttransplant and that the success of this therapy is likely to be maximized if given in the setting of minimal residual disease.","['Cullup, Hannah', 'Hsu, Andy K W', 'Kassianos, Andrew J', 'McDonald, Kylie', 'Radford, Kristen J', 'Rice, Alison M']","['Cullup H', 'Hsu AK', 'Kassianos AJ', 'McDonald K', 'Radford KJ', 'Rice AM']","['Immunotherapy Program, Mater Medical Research Institute, Aubigny Place, Raymond Terrace, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e31821b7230 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2011 May;34(4):362-71. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e31821b7230.,10.1097/CJI.0b013e31821b7230 [doi],,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of specific inhibitors against FcepsilonRI-associated proximal signaling molecules in mast cells may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for allergic diseases. We examined whether a novel synthetic compound, 3-butyl-1-chloro-8-(2-methoxycarbonyl)phenyl-5H-imidazo[1,5-b]isoquinolin-10-one (U63A05), could suppress antigen-stimulated degranulation and cytokine secretion in mast cells and IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mice. U63A05 reversibly and dose-dependently inhibited degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) stimulated by antigen (IC(50) values for RBL-2H3 and BMMCs were 4.1 and 4.8 microM, respectively). The secretion of inflammatory cytokines was also suppressed in antigen-stimulated mast cells. However, degranulation by thapsigargin, a typical calcium inducer, was not inhibited by U63A05. U63A05 exerts its inhibitory effect, to the same extent as in degranulation, on the activating phosphorylation of Syk and downstream signaling molecules, including LAT and SLP-76. Further downstream, the activating phosphorylations of Akt, Erk1/2, p38, and JNK were also inhibited. Finally, antigen-stimulated PCA was dose-dependently suppressed in mice (ED(50), 26.3 mg/kg). Taken together, the results suggest that U63A05 suppresses the activation of mast cells and the mast cell-mediated allergic response through the inhibition of Syk activation in mast cells.","['Kim, Do Kyun', 'Lee, Jun Ho', 'Kim, Jie Wan', 'Kim, Hyuk Soon', 'Kim, A-Ram', 'Kim, Bo Kyung', 'Yi, Kyu Yang', 'Park, Hye-Jin', 'Park, Dong Ki', 'Choi, Wahn Soo']","['Kim DK', 'Lee JH', 'Kim JW', 'Kim HS', 'Kim AR', 'Kim BK', 'Yi KY', 'Park HJ', 'Park DK', 'Choi WS']","['Institutes of Functional Genomics and College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Pharmacol Sci,Journal of pharmacological sciences,101167001,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/09/01 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jphs/10300FP [pii]', '10.1254/jphs.10300fp [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Sci. 2011;115(4):500-8. doi: 10.1254/jphs.10300fp.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (U63A05)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Interactions', 'Imidazoles/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Isoquinolines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/drug effects/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thapsigargin/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they show only limited effectiveness. We thought that the efficacy of GSIs might be improved by their combination with Hedgehog inhibitors and Wnt inhibitors because these signaling pathways are also important for the growth of leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of the combination of GSI-XXI plus the Hedgehog inhibitor, cyclopamine (Cy), or the Wnt inhibitor, quercetin (Qu), on the in vitro cell growth, colony formation and Notch1 protein expression of three T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines with NOTCH1 mutations and three acute myeloid leukemia cell lines were examined. RESULTS: The addition of Cy or Qu to GSI suppressed the growth of DND-41 T-ALL cells additively or synergistically, respectively. Interestingly, Cy treatment and Qu treatment reduced Notch1 protein and its active fragment in DND-41 cells, which suggests a relationship between Notch signaling and Hedgehog or Wnt signaling.

However, the effects of Hh stimulation on leukemia cells are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of recombinant sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein on the in vitro growth of one B-lymphoma and four myeloid leukemia cell lines were examined. RESULTS: Shh stimulation had no significant effect on the short-term growth of whole cell populations in any of the five cell lines. However, Shh promoted clonogenic cell recovery after suspension culture, suggesting promotion of leukemia stem or progenitor cell amplification in three cell lines. The lack of Hh receptors in one cell line and endogenous Shh expression in another were possible reasons for the lack of effects of Shh in these cases. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Shh stimulation promotes the self-renewal capacity of leukemia stem cells in some cell lines. Inhibition of Hh signaling could represent a novel therapeutic approach in leukemia.","['Kawaguchi-Ihara, Noriko', 'Okuhashi, Yuki', 'Itoh, Mai', 'Murohashi, Ikuo', 'Nara, Nobuo', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Kawaguchi-Ihara N', 'Okuhashi Y', 'Itoh M', 'Murohashi I', 'Nara N', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['31/3/781 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2011 Mar;31(3):781-4.,,,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Shh protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms that connect mutations in LMNA with different human diseases are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of a Muscle-enriched A-type Lamin-interacting Protein, MLIP (C6orf142 and 2310046A06rik), a unique single copy gene that is an innovation of amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals). MLIP encodes alternatively spliced variants (23-57 kDa) and possesses several novel structural motifs not found in other proteins. MLIP is expressed ubiquitously and most abundantly in heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle. MLIP interacts directly and co-localizes with lamin A and C in the nuclear envelope. MLIP also co-localizes with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies within the nucleus. PML, like MLIP, is only found in amniotes, suggesting that a functional link between the nuclear envelope and PML bodies may exist through MLIP. Down-regulation of lamin A/C expression by shRNA results in the up-regulation and mislocalization of MLIP. Given that MLIP is expressed most highly in striated and smooth muscle, it is likely to contribute to the mesenchymal phenotypes of laminopathies.","['Ahmady, Elmira', 'Deeke, Shelley A', 'Rabaa, Seham', 'Kouri, Lara', 'Kenney, Laura', 'Stewart, Alexandre F R', 'Burgon, Patrick G']","['Ahmady E', 'Deeke SA', 'Rabaa S', 'Kouri L', 'Kenney L', 'Stewart AF', 'Burgon PG']","['University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51048-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.165548 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 3;286(22):19702-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.165548.

PURPOSE: To compare whole-body DWI with FDG-PET/CT in the staging of lymphoma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients, eight with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 23 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (18 aggressive and five indolent) underwent both whole-body DWI, whole-body MRI (T1W and T2W-STIR) and FDG-PET/CT. Lesions on whole-body DWI were only considered positive if they correlated with lesions on T1W and T2W-STIR images. The staging given by each technique was compared, according to the Ann Arbor staging system. Differences in staging were solved using biopsy results, and clinical and CT follow-ups as standard of reference. RESULTS: The staging was the same for DWI and FDG-PET/CT in 28 (90.3%) patients and different in three (9.7%). Of the 28 patients with the same staging, 11 had stage IV in both techniques and 17 had stages 0-III. No HL or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients had different staging. Three indolent small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL) lymphoma had higher staging with DWI when compared with FDG-PET/CT. One small subcutaneous breast lymphoma was not seen but all other extranodal sites were detected by both techniques.

In this Personal View, we review evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies that supports a consistently lower than expected occurrence of cancer in patients with Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and anorexia nervosa.

To induce antileukemic effects, glucocorticoids have to bind their intracellular receptors. Little is known about probable mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance in ALL. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between 3 prominent glucocorticoid receptor gene polymorphisms-BclI, N363S, and ER22/23EK-and the risk of relapse in children with ALL. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study on 100 children with ALL, aged 0 to 15 years, including 50 nonrelapsed (control) and 50 relapsed (case) subjects. Required patient information such as demographic characteristics; relevant clinical and paraclinical findings at diagnosis; chemotherapy protocols used at diagnosis; and relapse properties, including time interval from date of initial diagnosis to relapse and number, type, and site of relapse, were gathered from patients' medical files. Genotyping of BclI, N363S, and ER22/23EK polymorphisms was carried out by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Statistical analysis was performed. The distribution of BclI, N363S, and ER22/23EK polymorphism genotypes in our population and in populations examined in similar studies was compared using the chi(2) test or Fischer exact test. RESULTS: One hundred children with ALL, consisting of 65 males and 35 females, were recruited into this study. Their mean (SD) age was 5.39 (3.02) years. No relapsed or nonrelapsed individuals were homozygous for N363S and ER22/23EK polymorphisms. The allelic frequencies of mutant alleles of BclI, N363S, and ER22/23EK polymorphisms in all patients were 0.195, 0.02, and 0.005, respectively. No statistically significant association between BclI, N363S, and ER22/23EK polymorphisms and risk of relapse in children with ALL was observed (P = 0.104 [BclI], not calculated for the last 2 polymorphisms [N363S and ER22/23EK]). The incidence of BclI polymorphism in our population (35/100) differed significantly from that in a Canadian population with European descent (135/219) and a Dutch population (29/53) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that there did not appear to be any prognostic value of BclI, ER22/23EK, and N363S polymorphisms for predicting relapse in this population of 100 Iranian children with ALL.","['Namazi, Soha', 'Zareifar, Soheila', 'Monabati, Ahmad', 'Ansari, Shahla', 'Karimzadeh, Iman']","['Namazi S', 'Zareifar S', 'Monabati A', 'Ansari S', 'Karimzadeh I']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(11)00144-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2011 Mar;33(3):280-90. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.03.004.

In the early 1970s, Chinese physicians from Harbin revived the medicinal use of arsenicals as anticancer agents. Notable success was observed in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with arsenic trioxide (ATO). The FDA approved ATO injection in the year 2000 for the treatment of APL. In contrast, the clinical use of the other arsenical, realgar (As(4)S(4)), is currently much less established, though it has also long been used in medical history. According to ancient medical records and recent findings in clinical trials, realgar was found as effective as ATO, but with relatively good oral safety profiles even on chronic administration. These give realgar an advantage over ATO in maintenance treatment. Though there is increasing understanding on the mechanisms of action and metabolic profiles of ATO, similar aspects of realgar are unclear to date. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We outline the use of realgar in traditional medicines, especially in traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) from ancient times to present. The clinical and experimental observations on realgar as a therapeutic agent are described with an emphasis on those findings that may imply the rationale and future directions of realgar as a potential anticancer drug candidate. RESULTS: There is an increasing understanding in the mechanisms of action of realgar as an antileukemic agent. However, there is still sparse information on its metabolism and toxicity profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Realgar is poorly soluble in water. Recently, several types of realgar nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed. Some of these realgar NPs also possess the unique optical properties of quantum dots. The activities and bioavailability of realgar NPs are much influenced by their sizes, making realgar an interesting biomedical and pharmaceutical research candidate.","['Wu, Jinzhu', 'Shao, Yanbin', 'Liu, Jialiang', 'Chen, Gang', 'Ho, Paul C']","['Wu J', 'Shao Y', 'Liu J', 'Chen G', 'Ho PC']","[""Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, No. 92 West DaZhi Street, Harbin 150001, People's Republic of China. wujinzhu@hit.edu.cn""]",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2010/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(11)00238-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2011.03.071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2011 Jun 1;135(3):595-602. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2011.03.071.

Deregulation of cellular transcription is thought to be an important step for T-cell transformation caused by viral infection. HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) is one of the viral proteins believed to be involved in this process, as it deregulates the expression of numerous cellular genes. In the context of the provirus, HBZ represses HTLV-1 transcription, in part, by binding to the homologous cellular coactivators p300 and CBP. These coactivators play a central role in transcriptional regulation. In this study, we determined that HBZ binds with high affinity to the KIX domain of p300/CBP. This domain contains two binding surfaces that are differentially targeted by multiple cellular factors. We show that two phiXXphiphi motifs in the activation domain of HBZ mediate binding to a single surface of the KIX domain, the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) binding surface. Formation of this interaction inhibits binding of MLL to the KIX domain while enhancing the binding of the transcription factor c-Myb to the opposite surface of KIX. Consequently, HBZ inhibits transcriptional activation mediated by MLL and enhances activation mediated by c-Myb. CREB, which binds the same surface of KIX as c-Myb, also exhibited an increase in activity through HBZ. These results indicate that HBZ is able to alter gene expression by competing with transcription factors for the occupancy of one surface of KIX while enhancing the binding of factors to the other surface.","['Cook, Pamela R', 'Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Lemasson, Isabelle']","['Cook PR', 'Polakowski N', 'Lemasson I']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 278374, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(11)00382-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2011 Jun 10;409(3):384-98. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.003.

METHODS: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were estimated for each cohort as a whole and in subgroups defined by race and sex, using the US general population mortality rates for comparison. Study subjects were followed up from January 1950 to December 2006, during which time over 60% of them died. RESULTS: An excess of deaths from cancers of the base of the tongue, esophagus, lung, skin, bone and bladder, lymphoid leukemia, and benign tumors of the thyroid and other endocrine glands, and possibly Hodgkin's disease, was observed in abattoir and meat processing workers. Significantly lower SMRs were recorded for cancer of the thymus, mediastinum, pleura, etc., breast cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the excess occurrence of cancer in workers in abattoirs and meat processing plants, butchers, and meatcutters, previously reported in this cohort and other similar cohorts worldwide. Large nested case-control studies are now needed to examine which specific occupational and non-occupational exposures are responsible for the excess. There is now sufficient evidence for steps to be taken to protect workers from carcinogenic exposures at the workplace. There are also serious implications for the general population which may also be exposed to some of these viruses.","['Johnson, E S']",['Johnson ES'],"['UNT Health Sciences Center, Department of Epidemiology, Fort Worth, Texas, USA.

Disturbed sleep in pediatric cancer is a common clinical observation, but research on this subject is sparse. In general, sleep problems can lead to significant morbidity and are associated with impaired QoL. Information on sleep is essential to develop interventions to improve QoL. METHODS: Children (2-18 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were eligible for this multi-center study. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Acute Cancer Version (PedsQL) were used to assess sleep and QoL halfway through maintenance therapy. Sleep and QoL were measured during and after dexamethasone treatment (on-dex and off-dex). RESULTS: Seventeen children participated (age 6.7 +/- 3.3 years, 44% boys). Children with ALL had more sleep problems and a lower QoL compared to the norm. There were no differences on-dex and off-dex. Pain (r = -0.6; p = 0.029) and worry (r = -0.5; p = 0.034) showed a moderate negative association with sleep. Reduced overall QoL was moderately associated with impaired overall sleep (r = -0.6; p = 0.014) and more problems with sleep anxiety (r = -0.8; p = 0.003), sleep onset delay (r = -0.5; p = 0.037), daytime sleepiness (r = -0.5; p = 0.044) and night wakenings (r = -0.6; p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: QoL is impaired in children during cancer treatment. The results of this study suggest that impaired sleep may be a contributing determinant. Consequently, enhanced counseling and treatment of sleep problems might improve QoL. It is important to conduct more extensive studies to confirm these findings and provide more detailed information on the relationship between sleep and QoL, and on factors affecting sleep in pediatric ALL and in children with cancer in general.","['van Litsenburg, Raphaele R L', 'Huisman, Jaap', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Egeler, R Maarten', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Gemke, Reinoud J B J']","['van Litsenburg RR', 'Huisman J', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Egeler RM', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Gemke RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. litsenburg@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7525-9-25 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7525-9-25 [doi]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2011 Apr 18;9:25. doi: 10.1186/1477-7525-9-25.,10.1186/1477-7525-9-25 [doi],20110418,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,PMC3095992,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However no such information in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) was available. We investigated the activity and expression of this protease in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 47 adult CML patients. Thirty adults suffering from systemic diseases and 50 healthy volunteers served as controls. The mRNA levels of CTSL, its specific endogenous inhibitor cystatin C and transcriptional up-regulator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were quantitated by real-time qPCR. CTSL protease activity and its mRNA expression were significantly higher in CML chronic phase (CP) patients compared to CML accelerated phase/blast crisis (AP/BC) patients and controls (P</= 0.001). VEGF whose expression was most pronounced in CP and declined (P</= 0.001) in the advanced phases of the malignancy exhibited a strong positive correlation with CTSL expression (r= 0.97; P</= 0.001). Cystatin C expression was significantly lower (P</= 0.001) in CML and displayed inverse correlation with CTSL (r=-0.713; P</= 0.001) activity. CTSL promoter was significantly hypomethylated in CML CP compared to CML AP/BC patients as well as controls. K562, a BC CML cell line displayed CTSL activity, expression and methylation status of CTSL promoter that was comparable to CML AP/BC patients. Treatment of these cells or PBMCs isolated from CML AP/BC patients with 5'-aza-cytidine resulted in a dramatic increase in CSTL activity and/or expression thereby demonstrating the role of promoter methylation in the stage specific expression of CTSL in CML. Differential expression of CTSL in CML at various stages of malignancy may prove useful in identification of the high-risk patients thereby facilitating better management of disease.","['Samaiya, Misti', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Shukla, Abhay A', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Chauhan, Shyam S']","['Samaiya M', 'Bakhshi S', 'Shukla AA', 'Kumar L', 'Chauhan SS']","['Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,2011/04/19 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01203.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2011 Oct;15(10):2189-99. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01203.x.,10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01203.x [doi],,"['0 (Cystatin C)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Cathepsin L)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cathepsin L/*genetics', 'Cystatin C/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",,PMC4394228,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of Tol on apoptosis and its mechanism were examined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoli um assay, Sub-G(1) population, Western blot analysis, 4'-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining and small interfering RNA transfection. RESULTS: Tol inhibited cell growth of YD-15 cells but Amp did not. Tol induces apoptosis in YD-15 cells as evidenced by nuclear fragmentation, accumulation of the sub-G1 phase and the activation of caspase 3. Tol inhibited myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) at the protein and mRNA levels. The treatment of MCL-1 siRNA to YD-15 cells resulted in the activation of caspase 3 and the inhibition of cell growth. Moreover, MCL-1 was regulated by specificity protein 1, but not by mitogen-activated protein kinases. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Tol could be a potent anti-cancer drug for YD-15 MEC cells that acts by regulating the MCL-1 protein.","['Choi, K-H', 'Shim, J-H', 'Huong, L D', 'Cho, N-P', 'Cho, S-D']","['Choi KH', 'Shim JH', 'Huong LD', 'Cho NP', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeon-ju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Oral Dis,Oral diseases,9508565,2011/04/19 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1601-0825.2010.01774.x [doi]'],ppublish,Oral Dis. 2011 Jul;17(5):469-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2010.01774.x.

Various mechanisms of resistance have been described in the past, some of them mediating absolute resistance and others, relative resistance, to imatinib. The latter can be overcome by dose intensification of imatinib. However, the availability of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors means these patients can be switched to these novel agents. Thus, which strategy is most appropriate for the individual patient with insufficient response to standard-dose imatinib remains elusive.

Despite efforts made to develop canine embryonic stem cells, success has been elusive. Here, we report the generation of canine induced pluripotent stem cells (ciPSCs) from canine adult fibroblasts, which we accomplished by introducing human OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4. The ciPSCs expressed critical pluripotency markers and showed evidence of silencing the viral vectors and normal karyotypes. Microsatellite analysis indicated that the ciPSCs showed the same profile as the donor fibroblasts but differed from cells taken from other dogs.

Mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of arsthinol at 0.2 mmol/kg of body weight. The amount of total arsenic in tissues and body fluids was determined by a colorimetric method and urine metabolites were analyzed on a C18 Acclaim PepMap 100 A column by LC-MS. Our results showed that only three arsenic species (acetarsol, acetarsol oxide and arsthinol) were detected in the first 24-h urine. Overall, this study confirms that the hydrolysis of dithiarsolanes to arsenoxides (i.e. acetarsol oxide) can be followed by an oxidation in arsonic acids (i.e. acetarsol).

PROCEDURES: In a meta-analysis of 21 publications with 4,706 cases and 7,414 controls, we used more stringent inclusion method and summarized data on associations between MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and childhood ALL risk. RESULTS: We found an overall association between 677T variant genotypes and reduced childhood ALL risk. Specifically, in the dominant genetic model, an association was found in a fixed-effect (TT + CT vs. CC: OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.85-0.99) but not random-effect model, whereas such an association was observed in both homozygote genetic model (TT vs. CC: OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.70-0.93 by fixed effects and OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.65-0.93 by random effects) and recessive genetic model (TT vs. CC + CT: OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.72-0.95 by fixed effects and OR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.73-0.97 by random effects). These associations were also observed in subgroups by ethnicity: for Asians in all models except for the dominant genetic model by random effect and for Caucasians in all models except for the recessive genetic model. However, the A1298C polymorphism did not appear to have an effect on childhood ALL risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the MTHFR C677T, but not A1298C, polymorphism is a potential biomarker for childhood ALL risk.","['Yan, Jingrong', 'Yin, Ming', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Kamdar, Kala', 'Wei, Qingyi', 'Okcu, M Fatih']","['Yan J', 'Yin M', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Scheurer ME', 'Kamdar K', 'Wei Q', 'Okcu MF']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2011/04/16 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23137 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Apr;58(4):513-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23137.

Although a mechanism for XMRV carcinogenesis is yet to be established, this virus belongs to the family of gammaretroviruses well known for their ability to induce cancer in the infected hosts. Since its original identification XMRV has been detected in several independent investigations; however, at this time significant controversy remains regarding reports of XMRV detection/prevalence in other cohorts and cell type/tissue distribution. The potential risk of human infection, coupled with the lack of knowledge about the basic biology of XMRV, warrants further research, including investigation of adaptive immune responses. To study immunogenicity in vivo, we vaccinated mice with a combination of recombinant vectors expressing codon-optimized sequences of XMRV gag and env genes and virus-like particles (VLP) that had the size and morphology of live infectious XMRV. RESULTS: Immunization elicited Env-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against XMRV in mice. The peak titers for ELISA-binding antibodies and NAb were 1:1024 and 1:464, respectively; however, high ELISA-binding and NAb titers were not sustained and persisted for less than three weeks after immunizations. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine-induced XMRV Env antibody titers were transiently high, but their duration was short. The relatively rapid diminution in antibody levels may in part explain the differing prevalences reported for XMRV in various prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome cohorts. The low level of immunogenicity observed in the present study may be characteristic of a natural XMRV infection in humans.","['Makarova, Natalia', 'Zhao, Chunxia', 'Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'Bhosle, Sushma', 'Suppiah, Suganthi', 'Rhea, Jeanne M', 'Kozyr, Natalia', 'Arnold, Rebecca S', 'Ly, Hinh', 'Molinaro, Ross J', 'Parslow, Tristram G', 'Hunter, Eric', 'Liotta, Dennis', 'Petros, John', 'Blackwell, Jerry L']","['Makarova N', 'Zhao C', 'Zhang Y', 'Bhosle S', 'Suppiah S', 'Rhea JM', 'Kozyr N', 'Arnold RS', 'Ly H', 'Molinaro RJ', 'Parslow TG', 'Hunter E', 'Liotta D', 'Petros J', 'Blackwell JL']","['Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/04/16 06:00,2011/08/17 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0018272 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Apr 6;6(4):e18272. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018272.,10.1371/journal.pone.0018272 [doi],20110406,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immunization', 'Mice', '*Models, Animal', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure']","['P30 AI050409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI069987/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-AI050409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 RR000165/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI076096/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 AI076096/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1AI076096-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00165/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI076080/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-AI076080/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI069987/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3071813,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2011;6(5). doi:10.1371/annotation/913fdc1e-877e-4c70-ac20-761d2d72400d'],,,,,,,,,,

CpG oligonucleotide and cytokine stimulation have been shown to improve metaphase analysis of CLL cytogenetic abnormalities, but is limited by variability in the cytokine receptor levels, stability and biological activity of the cytokine in culture conditions and high costs associated with these reagents. We report here use of a novel, stable CpG, GNKG168 along with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for conventional cytogenetic assessment in CLL. We demonstrate that the combined use of GNKG168+PWM/PMA increased the sensitivity of detection of chromosomal abnormalities compared to PWM/PMA (n=207, odds ratio=2.2, p=0.0002) and GNKG168 (n=219, odds ratio=1.5, p=0.0452). Further, a significant increase in sensitivity to detect complexity >/=3 with GNKG168+PWM/PMA compared to GNKG168 alone (odds ratio 8.0, p=0.0022) or PWM/PMA alone (odds ratio 9.6, p=0.0007) was observed. The trend toward detection of higher complexity was significantly greater with GNKG168+PWM/PMA compared to GNKG168 alone (p=0.0412). The increased sensitivity was mainly attributed to the addition of PWM/PMA with GNKG168 because GNKG168 alone showed no difference in sensitivity for detection of complex abnormalities (p=0.17).

By means of arterial-phase and low-dose delayed-phase scanning, multidetector-row computed tomography clearly identified the mural thrombus and the infarcted and noninfarcted myocardium-which surpassed the performance of echocardiography in tissue characterization.

Dysregulated signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is often the result of genetic alterations in critical components in this pathway as well as mutations at upstream growth factor receptors. Unrestricted leukemia proliferation and decreased sensitivity to apoptotic-inducing agents and chemoresistance are typically associated with activation of pro-survival pathways. Mutations in this pathway and upstream signaling molecules can alter sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors targeting components of this cascade as well as to inhibitors targeting other key pathways (for example, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)) activated in leukemia. Similarly, PI3K mutations can result in resistance to inhibitors targeting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, indicating important interaction points between the pathways (cross-talk). Furthermore, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can be activated by chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in leukemia therapy. This review discusses the mechanisms by which abnormal expression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can contribute to drug resistance as well as resistance to targeted leukemia therapy.

Its widespread clinical use has to some extent been hampered by differences in data analysis and presentation that complicate multicenter clinical trials. To address these issues, we designed a highly flexible MRD-reporting software program, in which data from various qPCR platforms can be imported, processed, and presented in a uniform manner to generate intuitively understandable reports. The software was tested in a two-step quality control (QC) study; the first step involved eight centers, whose previous experience with the software ranged from none to extensive. The participants received cDNA from consecutive samples from a BCR-ABL+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient and an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with both CBFbeta-MYH11 and WT1 target genes, they conducted qPCR on their respective hardware platforms and generated a series of reports with pre-defined features.

As GSI-I (Z-LLNle-CHO) is also a derivative of a widely used proteosome inhibitor MG-132, we hypothesized that this compound might be active in precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and patient samples. We found that GSI-I treatment of precursor-B ALL blasts induced apoptotic cell death within 18-24 h. With confirmation using RNA and protein analyses, GSI-I blocked nuclear accumulation of cleaved Notch1 and Notch2, and inhibited Notch targets Hey2 and Myc. Microarray analyses of 207 children with high-risk precursor-B ALL demonstrate that Notch pathway expression is a common feature of these neoplasms. However, microarray studies also implicated additional transcriptional targets in GSI-I-dependent cell death, including genes in the unfolded protein response, nuclear factor-kappaB and p53 pathways. Z-LLNle-CHO blocks both gamma-secretase and proteosome activity, inducing more robust cell death in precursor-B ALL cells than either proteosome-selective or gamma-secretase-selective inhibitors alone. Using Z-LLNle-CHO in a nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) precursor-B ALL xenograft model, we found that GSI-I alone delayed or prevented engraftment of B-lymphoblasts in 50% of the animals comprising the experimental group, suggesting that this compound is worthy of additional testing.","['Meng, X', 'Matlawska-Wasowska, K', 'Girodon, F', 'Mazel, T', 'Willman, C L', 'Atlas, S', 'Chen, I-M', 'Harvey, R C', 'Hunger, S P', 'Ness, S A', 'Winter, S S', 'Wilson, B S']","['Meng X', 'Matlawska-Wasowska K', 'Girodon F', 'Mazel T', 'Willman CL', 'Atlas S', 'Chen IM', 'Harvey RC', 'Hunger SP', 'Ness SA', 'Winter SS', 'Wilson BS']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/16 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201150 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jul;25(7):1135-46. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.50.

We report that AMD3100 increased the homeostatic release of the chemokine stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to the circulation in mice and non-human primates. Neutralizing antibodies against CXCR4 or SDF-1 inhibited both steady state and AMD3100-induced SDF-1 release and reduced egress of murine progenitor cells over mature leukocytes. Intra-bone injection of biotinylated SDF-1 also enhanced release of this chemokine and murine progenitor cell mobilization. AMD3100 directly induced SDF-1 release from CXCR4(+) human bone marrow osteoblasts and endothelial cells and activated uPA in a CXCR4/JNK-dependent manner. Additionally, ROS inhibition reduced AMD3100-induced SDF-1 release, activation of circulating uPA and mobilization of progenitor cells. Norepinephrine treatment, mimicking acute stress, rapidly increased SDF-1 release and progenitor cell mobilization, whereas beta2-adrenergic antagonist inhibited both steady state and AMD3100-induced SDF-1 release and progenitor cell mobilization in mice. In conclusion, this study reveals that SDF-1 release from bone marrow stromal cells to the circulation emerges as a pivotal mechanism essential for steady-state egress and rapid mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells, but not mature leukocytes.","['Dar, Ayelet', 'Schajnovitz, Amir', 'Lapid, Kfir', 'Kalinkovich, Alexander', 'Itkin, Tomer', 'Ludin, Aya', 'Kao, Wei-Ming', 'Battista, Michela', 'Tesio, Melania', 'Kollet, Orit', 'Cohen, Neta Netzer', 'Margalit, Raanan', 'Buss, Eike C', 'Baleux, Francoise', 'Oishi, Shinya', 'Fujii, Nobutaka', 'Larochelle, Andre', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Frenette, Paul S', 'Lapidot, Tsvee']","['Dar A', 'Schajnovitz A', 'Lapid K', 'Kalinkovich A', 'Itkin T', 'Ludin A', 'Kao WM', 'Battista M', 'Tesio M', 'Kollet O', 'Cohen NN', 'Margalit R', 'Buss EC', 'Baleux F', 'Oishi S', 'Fujii N', 'Larochelle A', 'Dunbar CE', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Frenette PS', 'Lapidot T']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Medicine, Immunology Institute, and Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Immunology Institute, and Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Institute Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Hematopoiesis Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Molecular Hematopoiesis Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indianapolis, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Immunology Institute, and Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/16 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2011.62 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1286-1296. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.62.

A crucial part of restoring homeostasis following irradiation is the ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to home to and engraft specialized niches within the BM through a remodeling BM vascular system.

Ultra-high-field MRI can achieve high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images (28 x 28 x 60 mum(3)) of the BM in live mice, sufficient to resolve anatomical changes in BM microstructures attributed to radiation damage. Following intra-arterial infusion with dsRed-expressing BM cells, labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxides, both FLM and MRI could be used to follow initial homing and engraftment of donor HSC to a limited number of preferred sites within a few cell diameters of the calcified bone-the endosteal niche.

METHODS: To elucidate the relevance of the SNF5 gene on 22q11.2, karyotypes were reviewed in 283 hematological neoplasms. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 22q was analyzed in 21 plasma cell myelomas without chromosome 22 abnormalities. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) on the SNF5 gene was analyzed in 8 hematological neoplasms with 22q- or -22, and 8 chronic myelogenous leukemias (CMLs) in blast crisis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in 1 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) case with -22,del(22)(q11.2 q13). RESULTS: 22q- or -22 was observed in 36 patients. LOH on 22q was detected in 1 of the 21 myelomas. Mobility shifts were found by PCR-SSCP analysis in 2 CMLs, whereas sequence analysis showed polymorphisms. FISH analysis revealed the SNF5 gene was not deleted in the MDS case.

Especially challenging is selecting an optimal subset of features from high-dimensional data, which typically have many more variables than observations and contain significant noise, missing components, or outliers. Existing methods either cannot handle high-dimensional data efficiently or scalably, or can only obtain local optimum instead of global optimum. Toward the selection of the globally optimal subset of features efficiently, we introduce a new selector--which we call the Fisher-Markov selector--to identify those features that are the most useful in describing essential differences among the possible groups. In particular, in this paper we present a way to represent essential discriminating characteristics together with the sparsity as an optimization objective. With properly identified measures for the sparseness and discriminativeness in possibly high-dimensional settings, we take a systematic approach for optimizing the measures to choose the best feature subset. We use Markov random field optimization techniques to solve the formulated objective functions for simultaneous feature selection. Our results are noncombinatorial, and they can achieve the exact global optimum of the objective function for some special kernels. The method is fast; in particular, it can be linear in the number of features and quadratic in the number of observations. We apply our procedure to a variety of real-world data, including mid--dimensional optical handwritten digit data set and high-dimensional microarray gene expression data sets. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by experimental results. In pattern recognition and from a model selection viewpoint, our procedure says that it is possible to select the most discriminating subset of variables by solving a very simple unconstrained objective function which in fact can be obtained with an explicit expression.","['Cheng, Qiang', 'Zhou, Hongbo', 'Cheng, Jie']","['Cheng Q', 'Zhou H', 'Cheng J']","['Department of Computer Science, Faner Hall, Mailcode 4511, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, 1000 Faner Drive, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA. qcheng@cs.siu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,9885960,2011/04/16 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/TPAMI.2010.195 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell. 2011 Jun;33(6):1217-33. doi: 10.1109/TPAMI.2010.195.,10.1109/TPAMI.2010.195 [doi],,,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/classification', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Software']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains unclear whether these deficits are explained by genetic or environmental factors. To better understand environmental contributions, we examined incidence patterns of lymphoid malignancies among populations characterized by ethnicity, birthplace, and residential neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnic enclave status. METHODS: We obtained data about all Asian patients diagnosed with lymphoid malignancies between 1988 and 2004 from the California Cancer Registry and neighborhood characteristics from U.S. Census data. RESULTS: Although incidence rates of most lymphoid malignancies were lower among Asian than white populations, only follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), and nodular sclerosis (NS) HL rates were statistically significantly lower among foreign-born than U.S.-born Asians with incidence rate ratios ranging from 0.34 to 0.87.

Moreover, a higher incidence for therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia with 11q23 translocations after treatment with topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors has been observed in Hispanic children with ALL. We sought to determine the potential role of genetic variants within the topoisomerase IIalpha gene (TOP2A), within the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) and two of its translocation partners, cyclin AMP response element-binding protein gene (CREBBP) and E1A binding protein gene (EP300) in the increased sensitivity of Hispanic children with ALL to topo II inhibitors. METHODS: Fifty-two tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) covering the four genes were genotyped in 241 samples (66 children with ALL and 175 age matched controls) of self-identified Hispanic origin. RESULTS: Two SNPs within MLL (rs525549 and rs6589664) and three SNPs within EP300 (rs5758222, rs7286979, and rs20551) were significantly associated with ALL (P = 0.001-0.04). A significant gene-dosage effect for increasing numbers of potential high-risk genotypes (OR = 16.66; P = 2 x 10(-5)) and a major haplotype significantly associated with ALL (OR = 5.68; P = 2 x 10(-6)) were found. Replication in a sample of 137 affected White children and 239 controls showed that only rs6589664 (MLL) was significantly associated in this ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the association between ALL and common genetic variants within MLL and EP300 is population specific. IMPACT: Replication of our findings in independent Hispanic populations is warranted to elucidate the role of these variants in ALL susceptibility and define their importance in the ethnic specific differences in ALL risk.","['Piwkham, Duangjai', 'Gelfond, Jonathan A L', 'Rerkamnuaychoke, Budsaba', 'Pakakasama, Samart', 'Rebel, Vivienne I', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Collier, Anderson B 3rd', 'Tomlinson, Gail E', 'Beuten, Joke']","['Piwkham D', 'Gelfond JA', 'Rerkamnuaychoke B', 'Pakakasama S', 'Rebel VI', 'Pollock BH', 'Winick NJ', 'Collier AB 3rd', 'Tomlinson GE', 'Beuten J']","[""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 78229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,2011/04/16 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-11-0059 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0059 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2011 Jun;20(6):1204-12. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0059.

However, while PDK1 has been investigated intensively as an oncology target, selective inhibitors suitable for in vivo studies have remained elusive. In this study we present the results of in vivo PDK1 inhibition through a universally applicable RNAi approach for functional drug target validation in oncogenic pathway contexts. This approach, which relies on doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression from the Rosa26 locus, is ideal for functional studies of genes like PDK1 where constitutive mouse models lead to strong developmental phenotypes or embryonic lethality. We achieved more than 90% PDK1 knockdown in vivo, a level sufficient to impact physiological functions resulting in hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. This phenotype was reversible on PDK1 reexpression. Unexpectedly, long-term PDK1 knockdown revealed a lack of potent antitumor efficacy in 3 different mouse models of PTEN-deficient cancer. Thus, despite efficient PDK1 knockdown, inhibition of the PI3K pathway was marginal suggesting that PDK1 was not a rate limiting factor. Ex vivo analysis of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that AKT and mTOR inhibitors undergoing clinical development are more effective than PDK1 inhibitors at blocking activated PI3K pathway signaling. Taken together our findings weaken the widely held expectation that PDK1 represents an appealing oncology target.","['Ellwood-Yen, Katharine', 'Keilhack, Heike', 'Kunii, Kaiko', 'Dolinski, Brian', 'Connor, Yamicia', 'Hu, Kun', 'Nagashima, Kumiko', ""O'Hare, Erin"", 'Erkul, Yusuf', 'Di Bacco, Alessandra', 'Gargano, Diana', 'Shomer, Nirah H', 'Angagaw, Minilik', 'Leccese, Erica', 'Andrade, Paula', 'Hurd, Melissa', 'Shin, Myung K', 'Vogt, Thomas F', 'Northrup, Alan', 'Bobkova, Ekaterina V', 'Kasibhatla, Shailaja', 'Bronson, Roderick T', 'Scott, Martin L', 'Draetta, Giulio', 'Richon, Victoria', 'Kohl, Nancy', 'Blume-Jensen, Peter', 'Andersen, Jannik N', 'Kraus, Manfred']","['Ellwood-Yen K', 'Keilhack H', 'Kunii K', 'Dolinski B', 'Connor Y', 'Hu K', 'Nagashima K', ""O'Hare E"", 'Erkul Y', 'Di Bacco A', 'Gargano D', 'Shomer NH', 'Angagaw M', 'Leccese E', 'Andrade P', 'Hurd M', 'Shin MK', 'Vogt TF', 'Northrup A', 'Bobkova EV', 'Kasibhatla S', 'Bronson RT', 'Scott ML', 'Draetta G', 'Richon V', 'Kohl N', 'Blume-Jensen P', 'Andersen JN', 'Kraus M']","['Merck Research Laboratories, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2011/04/16 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['71/8/3052 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2282 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 15;71(8):3052-65. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2282.,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2282 [doi],,"['0 (Pdk1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*enzymology/genetics', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*deficiency/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase', 'RNA Interference']",,,['(c)2011 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the immunomodulator (MDP-Ab) was constructed by coupling anti-CD10 monoclonal antibody (MAb) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) using heterobifunctional reagent SPDP and the activity of MDP-Ab through dendritic cells (DCs)-based immunotherapy was identified in targeted therapy for leukemia. Results showed that the molecular ratio of purified MDP-Ab immunomodulator was about 2:1 according to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The immunoreactivity and specificity of the new immunomodulator on CD10 antigen was identical to that of unconjugated native anti-CD10 MAb. The immunomodulatory effect of MDP-Ab immunoconjugate on peripheral blood dendritic cells (PBDCs) from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exhibited upregulated expression of HLA-DR, co-stimulatory marker (CD80 and CD86) and maturity marker (CD83), increased cytokine secretion (interleukin-12, IL-12) and enhanced autostimulatory activity.

We previously identified the fusion of the ETV6 gene to the LYN gene (ETV6-LYN) in idiopathic myelofibrosis with ins(12;8)(p13;q11q21). The introduction of ETV6-LYN into HSCs resulted in fatal MPN with massive myelofibrosis in mice, implicating the rearranged LYN kinase in the pathogenesis of MPN with myelofibrosis. However, the signalling molecules directly downstream from and activated by ETV6-LYN remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the direct activation of STAT5 by ETV6-LYN is crucial for the development of MPN. ETV6-LYN was constitutively active as a kinase through autophosphorylation. ETV6-LYN, but not its kinase-dead mutant, supported cytokine-free proliferation of haematopoietic cells. STAT5 was activated in a JAK2-independent manner in ETV6-LYN-expressing cells. ETV6-LYN interacted with STAT5 and directly activated STAT5 both in vitro and in vivo. Of note, ETV6-LYN did not support the formation of colonies by Stat5-deficient HSCs under cytokine-free conditions and the capacity of ETV6-LYN to induce MPN with myelofibrosis was profoundly attenuated in a Stat5-null background. These findings define STAT5 as a direct target of ETV6-LYN and unveil the LYN-STAT5 axis as a novel pathway to augment proliferative signals in MPN and leukaemia.","['Takeda, Yusuke', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Tanaka, Hiroaki', 'Takeuchi, Masahiro', 'Yui, Makiko', 'Saraya, Atsunori', 'Miyagi, Satoru', 'Wang, Changshan', 'Tanaka, Satomi', 'Ohwada, Chikako', 'Sakaida, Emiko', 'Yamaguchi, Naoto', 'Yokote, Koutaro', 'Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Takeda Y', 'Nakaseko C', 'Tanaka H', 'Takeuchi M', 'Yui M', 'Saraya A', 'Miyagi S', 'Wang C', 'Tanaka S', 'Ohwada C', 'Sakaida E', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Yokote K', 'Hennighausen L', 'Iwama A']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Clinical Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2011/04/16 06:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2011/04/16 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08663.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jun;153(5):589-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08663.x.

At the first examination a macular branch retinal vein occlusion and Roth spots were found in the right eye by indirect ophthalmoscopy. The immediate diagnostic procedure identified aute amyeloid leukemia (AML) as the cause of the vascular pathology. The AML can be manifested in different ways and the retina is involved in approximately 50% of cases. Due to a secondary hyperviscosity syndrome, which is found in approx. 20% of acute leukaemias, symptomatic central vein occlusion or macular branch vein occlusion can occur. Ophthalmic symptoms can be the first and only signs to be detected. Therefore, ophthalmologists should also consider a systemic disease and initiate a clarification.

We show that overexpression of SUMO-1 in human 293T cells, but not in mouse MDTF cells, profoundly blocks N-MLV infection. This block is dependent on the tropism of the incoming virus, as neither B-, NB-, nor the mutant R110E of N-MLV CA (a B-tropic switch) are affected by SUMO-1 overexpression. The block occurred prior to reverse transcription and could be abrogated by large amounts of restricted virus. Knockdown of TRIM5alpha in 293T SUMO-1-overexpressing cells resulted in ablation of the SUMO-1 antiviral effects, and this loss of restriction could be restored by expression of a human TRIM5alpha shRNA-resistant plasmid. Amino acid sequence analysis of human TRIM5alpha revealed a consensus SUMO conjugation site at the N-terminus and three putative SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) in the B30.2 domain. Mutations of the TRIM5alpha consensus SUMO conjugation site did not affect the antiviral activity of TRIM5alpha in any of the cell types tested. Mutation of the SIM consensus sequences, however, abolished TRIM5alpha antiviral activity against N-MLV. Mutation of lysines at a potential site of SUMOylation in the CA region of the Gag gene reduced the SUMO-1 block and the TRIM5alpha restriction of N-MLV. Our data suggest a novel aspect of TRIM5alpha-mediated restriction, in which the presence of intact SIMs in TRIM5alpha, and also the SUMO conjugation of CA, are required for restriction. We propose that at least a portion of the antiviral activity of TRIM5alpha is mediated through the binding of its SIMs to SUMO-conjugated CA.","['Arriagada, Gloria', 'Muntean, Lucia N', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Arriagada G', 'Muntean LN', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,2011/04/15 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2011/04/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002019 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Apr;7(4):e1002019. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002019.

Previous reports have shown that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with diverse brain disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety (1). Deciphering the process of normal and aberrant adult-born neuron integration may shed light on the etiology of these diseases and inform the development of new therapies. SGZ adult neurogenesis mirrors embryonic and post-natal neuronal development, including stages of fate specification, migration, synaptic integration, and maturation. However, full integration occurs over a prolonged, 6-week period. Initial synaptic input to adult-born SGZ dentate granule cells (DGCs) is GABAergic, followed by glutamatergic input at 14 days (2). The specific factors which regulate circuit formation of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus are currently unknown. Our laboratory uses a replication-deficient retroviral vector based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus to deliver fluorescent proteins and hypothesized regulatory genes to these proliferating cells. This viral technique provides high specificity and resolution for analysis of cell birth date, lineage, morphology, and synaptogenesis. A typical experiment often employs two or three viruses containing unique label, transgene, and promoter elements for single-cell analysis of a desired developmental process in vivo. The following protocol describes a method for analyzing functional newborn neuron integration using a single green (GFP) or red (dTomato) fluorescent protein retrovirus and patch-clamp electrophysiology.","['Gu, Yan', 'Janoschka, Stephen', 'Ge, Shaoyu']","['Gu Y', 'Janoschka S', 'Ge S']","['Department of Neurobiology & Behavior, State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,2011/04/15 06:00,2011/06/16 06:00,['2011/04/15 06:00'],"['2011/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['2548 [pii]', '10.3791/2548 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2011 Mar 25;(49). pii: 2548. doi: 10.3791/2548.,10.3791/2548 [doi] 2548 [pii],20110325,,IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neural Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Neurogenesis/physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology']",['R01 NS065915/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3197309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PP2A is a phosphatase and tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A) is a recently described inhibitor of PP2A in breast and gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CIP2A played a role in CML and whether PP2A or its inhibitor proteins CIP2A or SET could predict clinical outcome. At the time of diagnosis of CML, patients who will later progress to blast crisis have significantly higher levels of CIP2A protein (P < .0001) than patients who do not progress, suggesting that PP2A is functionally inactive. We show that the potential mechanism for disease progression is via altered phosphorylation of the oncogene c-Myc. Knockdown of CIP2A results in increased PP2A activity, decreased c-Myc levels, and a decrease in BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase activity. We demonstrate that CIP2A levels at diagnosis can consistently predict patients who will progress to blast crisis. The data show that CIP2A is biologically and clinically important in CML and may be a novel therapeutic target.","['Lucas, Claire M', 'Harris, Robert J', 'Giannoudis, Athina', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Clark, Richard E']","['Lucas CM', 'Harris RJ', 'Giannoudis A', 'Copland M', 'Slupsky JR', 'Clark RE']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/15 06:00,2011/09/03 06:00,['2011/04/15 06:00'],"['2011/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44928-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-304477 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 16;117(24):6660-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-304477.

Thus, cats present an insight into the evolution of the host-retrovirus relationship and the development of intrinsic/innate immune mechanisms. Tetherin (BST-2) is an interferon-inducible transmembrane protein that inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from infected cells. Here, we characterize the feline homologue of tetherin and assess its effects on the replication of FIV. Tetherin was expressed in many feline cell lines, and expression was induced by interferons, including alpha interferon (IFN-alpha), IFN-omega, and IFN-gamma. Like human tetherin, feline tetherin displayed potent inhibition of FIV and HIV-1 particle release; however, this activity resisted antagonism by either HIV-1 Vpu or the FIV Env and ""OrfA"" proteins. Further, as overexpression of complete FIV genomes in trans could not overcome feline tetherin, these data suggest that FIV lacks a functional tetherin antagonist. However, when expressed stably in feline cell lines, tetherin did not abrogate the replication of FIV; indeed, syncytium formation was significantly enhanced in tetherin-expressing cells infected with cell culture-adapted (CD134-independent) strains of FIV (FIV Fca-F14 and FIV Pco-CoLV). Thus, while tetherin may prevent the release of nascent viral particles, cell-to-cell spread remains efficient in the presence of abundant viral receptors and tetherin upregulation may enhance syncytium formation. Accordingly, tetherin expression in vivo may promote the selective expansion of viral variants capable of more efficient cell-to-cell spread.","['Dietrich, Isabelle', 'McMonagle, Elizabeth L', 'Petit, Sarah J', 'Vijayakrishnan, Swetha', 'Logan, Nicola', 'Chan, Chi N', 'Towers, Greg J', 'Hosie, Margaret J', 'Willett, Brian J']","['Dietrich I', 'McMonagle EL', 'Petit SJ', 'Vijayakrishnan S', 'Logan N', 'Chan CN', 'Towers GJ', 'Hosie MJ', 'Willett BJ']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2011/04/15 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2011/04/15 06:00'],"['2011/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00071-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00071-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Jun;85(12):5840-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00071-11.

Expression of UL35 in transfected cells results in the formation of UL35 nuclear bodies that associate with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. PML forms the basis for PML nuclear bodies that are important for suppressing viral lytic gene expression. Given the important relationship between PML and viral infection, we have further investigated the association of UL35 with PML bodies. We demonstrate that UL35 bodies form independently of PML and subsequently recruit PML, Sp100 and Daxx. In contrast, UL35a did not form bodies; however, it could bind UL35 and inhibit the formation of UL35 bodies. The HCMV tegument protein pp71 promoted the formation of UL35 bodies and the cytoplasmic localization of UL35a. Similarly, UL35a shifted pp71 to the cytoplasm.

Nevertheless, the causes of MDS remain poorly defined and it is not clear how the disease progresses from an early stage to advanced MDS and AML. Although there are clear indications for a role of the immune system, the exact mechanism by which the immune response contributes to the progression is not yet clear.

We previously identified the LAT2 gene, encoding the adaptor molecule LAT2 (NTAL, LAB), which is phosphorylated by KIT and has a role in mast cell and B-cell activation, as a target of the repressor activity of RUNX1/RUNX1T1. These results were confirmed and extended by demonstrating downregulation of the LAT2 protein in response to conditional RUNX1/RUNX1T1 expression, and its absence in primary AML with the t(8;21). In contrast, in a cohort of 43 AML patients, higher levels of LAT2 were associated with myelomonocytic features. Differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells towards granulocytes by all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) resulted in downregulation of LAT2; conversely, it was upregulated during phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Forced expression of LAT2 in Kasumi-1 cells resulted in a striking block of ATRA- and phorbol ester-induced differentiation, implicating disturbances of the graded expression of this adaptor molecule in the maturation block of myeloid leukaemia cells.","['Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Solari, Leticia', 'Essig, Aitomi', 'Berg, Tobias', 'Pahl, Heike L', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Duque-Afonso J', 'Solari L', 'Essig A', 'Berg T', 'Pahl HL', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2011/04/15 06:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2011/04/15 06:00'],"['2011/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08586.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jun;153(5):612-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08586.x.

The only treatment capable of providing long-term remission (in about 1 in 2 patients on average) is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but this burdensome treatment can only be used in a minority of cases. Azacitidine (Vidaza, Celgene), an agent that blocks DNA synthesis, is the first drug to receive EU marketing authorisation in these settings. Its clinical evaluation is based on an unblinded trial that included 358 patients comparable to those discussed in the marketing authorisation. In addition to individually tailored symptomatic care, they were randomised to receive either azacitidine or conventional care regimens chosen by their physician (no treatment, low-dose cytarabine, or an anthracycline plus cytarabine). The median overall survival time was significantly longer with azacitidine (24.5 versus 15 months), and transfusion requirements were also reduced. Another comparative trial versus symptomatic treatment alone in 191 patients with various prognoses also showed an increase in survival time with azacitidine, but this study suffered from methodological flaws. The main adverse effects of azacitidine are potentially severe toxicity for various blood cells, gastrointestinal disorders, and reactions at the injection site.

PROCEDURE: In a cohort of 78 ALL survivors (52 chemotherapy-treated and 26 HCT-treated), we determined the prevalence of, and host, treatment and environmental risk factors for 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency and deficiency. RESULTS: There were no differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between ALL survivors treated with conventional chemotherapy and those treated with HCT (median 26.0 vs 25.5 ng/ml). Fifty-three percent of pediatric ALL survivors were 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficient (15-29 ng/dl), and 12% were deficient (<15 ng/dl). Younger age, higher reported dietary vitamin D intake, use of vitamin D supplementation, and increased ambient ultraviolet light were associated with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. There was not enough evidence to suggest treatment type, gender, race, years since diagnosis or BMI were associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Only 27% of conventional chemotherapy-treated ALL survivors and 8% of HCT-treated ALL survivors met RDA for dietary vitamin D intake. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in ALL survivors is similar to that of the general pediatric population in the United States, and there is no difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status between chemotherapy-treated and HCT-treated ALL survivors. ALL survivors rarely meet the RDA requirements for vitamin D. Further studies are needed to determine whether dietary and behavioral interventions can improve the vitamin D status of ALL survivors.","['Simmons, Jill H', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Koehler, Elizabeth', 'Esbenshade, Adam', 'Smith, Lesley-Ann', 'Sanders, Jean', 'Friedman, Debra']","['Simmons JH', 'Chow EJ', 'Koehler E', 'Esbenshade A', 'Smith LA', 'Sanders J', 'Friedman D']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. jill.h.simmons@vanderbilt.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22949 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Jul 1;56(7):1114-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22949.

We tried to assess the in vitro effect of humic acids from a selected source in Slovakia when used at recommended prophylactic dosage. We investigated antioxidant properties, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defence system in liver mitochondria and cultured cancer cell lines in vitro. We observed a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity after humic acids treatment irrespective of dissolving in dimethyl sulphoxide or direct addition to mitochondria suspension in a respiration medium. Activities of other antioxidant enzymes measured, such as glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, showed no significant differences from the control as well as the reduced glutathione content. Percentage of inhibition by humic acids of superoxide radical indicated lower efficacy compared with that of hydroxyl radical. Survival of six different cancer cells lines indicated that only the acute T lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line was sensitive to the tested humic acids. Despite relatively low solubility in aqueous solutions, humic acids from the selected source participated in redox regulation. By recapturing the radicals, humic acids reloaded the antioxidant defensive mechanism. Results from in vitro study conducted with humic acids from the natural source showed potential of these substances as promising immunity enhancing agents.","['Vaskova, Janka', 'Velika, Beata', 'Pilatova, Martina', 'Kron, Ivan', 'Vasko, Ladislav']","['Vaskova J', 'Velika B', 'Pilatova M', 'Kron I', 'Vasko L']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, Tr.

We present two cases of 5q- syndrome with a similar and unusual course of transformation to lymphoblastic leukemia while on Lenalidomide. These two patients achieved an initial response; however, later acquired a second cytogenetic abnormality, became refractory to treatment and evolved into acute leukemia. At the time of transformation, both patients had recurrence of the 5q- abnormality. Review of the literature and the mechanisms of transformation of the 5q-syndrome into an acute leukemia are discussed. Although the relationship between the events in our cases remains unclear, the intriguing similarity between the two cases raises a question whether immune modulators can alter the natural course of MDS. To our knowledge, no similar cases were previously reported in the literature.","['Agostino, Nicole M', 'Ahmed, Basil', 'Popescu, Dan', 'Gheith, Shereen']","['Agostino NM', 'Ahmed B', 'Popescu D', 'Gheith S']","['Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Allentown, PA 18105, USA.

B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a form of leukemia characterized by the slow and progressive accumulation of monoclonal CD5+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and other organs. A T-helper 1 cytokine-mediated pathway is involved in these disorders in which tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role. TNF-alpha is involved in physiological phenomena, such as host defense, inflammation and cell differentiation, and in many pathological conditions, such as fever and some malignant neoplasms. TNF-alpha involvement in psoriasis has been well validated by the clinical success of anti-TNF-alpha therapy. TNF-alpha has been well studied in the pathogenesis of B-CLL, suggesting it as a target in B-CLL therapy. We present the case of a patient suffering from plaque psoriasis and B-CLL. Since TNF-alpha is reported as a common link between psoriasis and B-CLL, the patient was treated with etanercept followed by infliximab, two anti-TNF-alpha drugs. During 3 years of therapy, the patient did not show significant modifications of lymphocyte levels, indicating no progression of B-CLL. We report this case to highlight the possibility to administer anti-TNF-alpha treatment in psoriatic patients affected by concomitant B-CLL.","['Balato, Anna', 'Lembo, Serena', 'Cirillo, Teresa', 'Megna, Matteo', 'Raimondo, Annunziata', 'Di Costanzo, Luisa']","['Balato A', 'Lembo S', 'Cirillo T', 'Megna M', 'Raimondo A', 'Di Costanzo L']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Case Rep Dermatol,Case reports in dermatology,101517685,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/04/14 06:01,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000324344 [doi]', '000324344 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Dermatol. 2011 Mar 7;3(1):60-3. doi: 10.1159/000324344.,10.1159/000324344 [doi],20110307,,,,,PMC3073755,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-TNF-alpha drugs', 'B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Psoriasis', 'Tumor necrosis factor-alpha']",,,,,,,,,,,

The term severe maternal morbidity has been proposed to refer to life-threatening complications that occur during pregnancy, delivery or postpartum. Objective Characterize severe maternal morbidity in obstetric patients admitted to the ICU of the Enrique Cabrera General Teaching Hospital in Havana from 1998 to 2004. Methods From 1998 to 2004, we conducted a prospective, descriptive, and observational study of 312 patients admitted to the ICU of the Enrique Cabrera General Teaching Hospital in Havana, Cuba. Patients were included whose length of stay was >24 hours, and whose family members provided written informed consent. A data collection form was developed to record general characteristics, personal and family medical history, cause of ICU admission, diagnosis, obstetric condition at the onset of illness and at admission, pregnancy outcome, surgeries performed and patient's ICU discharge status (survivor or non-survivor), the latter a dependent variable. An Excel database was compiled and processed using SPSS 13.0. Percentages were used to summarize qualitative variables. A Chi-square test was used for univariate analysis between these qualitative variables and patient discharge status; t-test was used for quantitative analyses. Results Overall mortality in the cohort was 7.4% (23 patients), greater among women aged <20 years, those with a history of previous illnesses, and those subjected to several surgical interventions. Obstetric hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, and postpartum sepsis were the most commonly diagnosed obstetric disorders. Non-obstetric disorders diagnosed included severe asthma, pneumonia and peritonitis. Amniotic fluid embolism, postpartum sepsis, early postpartum hemorrhage and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia were associated with the highest hospital case fatality rates in women with obstetric disorders; while acute chest syndrome, promyelocytic leukemia and pulmonary embolism were associated with the highest hospital case fatality rates among women with non-obstetric disorders. Conclusions Our results concur with most of those published on severe maternal morbidity in ICUs, including a high incidence of hemorrhagic disorders, pre-eclampsia and postpartum sepsis. The number of patients with hematological disorders accounts for the difference between the results of our study and others concerning morbidity and mortality among this patient group. A significant correlation was observed between history of previous illnesses and patient discharge status. Prognosis was worse for patients subjected to several surgical interventions, which can be attributed to the higher risk of complications and the severity of the underlying illness.","['Perez, Albadio', 'Bacallao, Jorge', 'Alcina, Serafin', 'Gomez, Yamilka']","['Perez A', 'Bacallao J', 'Alcina S', 'Gomez Y']","['Higher Institute of Medical Sciences of Havana, Cuba. albadio.perez@infomed.sld.cu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,MEDICC Rev,MEDICC review,100964771,2008/07/01 00:00,2008/07/01 00:01,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.37757/MR2008.V10.N3.7 [doi]'],ppublish,MEDICC Rev. 2008 Jul;10(3):17-23. doi: 10.37757/MR2008.V10.N3.7.,10.37757/MR2008.V10.N3.7 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated a treatment strategy combining sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with limited single-agent activity in AML, and cytarabine, a key component of AML chemotherapy. METHODS: Using 10 human AML cell lines, we determined the effects of sorafenib (10 muM) on antileukemic activity by measuring cell viability, proliferation, ERK1/2 signaling, and apoptosis. We also investigated the effects of sorafenib treatment on the accumulation of cytarabine and phosphorylated metabolites in vitro. A human equivalent dose of sorafenib in nontumor-bearing NOD-SCID-IL2Rgamma(null) mice was determined by pharmacokinetic studies using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection, and steady-state concentrations were estimated by the fit of a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model to concentration-time data. The antitumor activity of sorafenib alone (60 mg/kg) twice daily, cytarabine alone (6.25 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally), or sorafenib once or twice daily plus cytarabine was evaluated in NOD-SCID-IL2Rgamma(null) mice bearing AML xenografts. RESULTS: Sorafenib at 10 muM inhibited cell viability, proliferation and ERK1/2 signaling, and induced apoptosis in all cell lines studied. Sorafenib also increased the cellular accumulation of cytarabine and metabolites resulting in additive to synergistic antileukemic activity. A dose of 60 mg/kg in mice produced a human equivalent sorafenib steady-state plasma exposure of 10 muM. The more dose-intensive twice-daily sorafenib plus cytarabine (n = 15) statistically significantly prolonged median survival in an AML xenograft model compared with sorafenib once daily plus cytarabine (n = 12), cytarabine alone (n = 26), or controls (n = 27) (sorafenib twice daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 46 days; sorafenib once daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 40 days; cytarabine alone, median survival = 36 days; control, median survival = 19 days; P < .001 for combination twice daily vs all other treatments listed). CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib in combination with cytarabine resulted in strong anti-AML activity in vitro and in vivo. These results warrant clinical evaluation of sorafenib with cytarabine-based regimens in molecularly heterogeneous AML.","['Hu, Shuiying', 'Niu, Hongmei', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Rose, Charles', 'Panetta, John C', 'Yang, Shengping', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Calabrese, Christopher', 'Rehg, Jerold E', 'Campana, Dario', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Hu S', 'Niu H', 'Inaba H', 'Orwick S', 'Rose C', 'Panetta JC', 'Yang S', 'Pounds S', 'Fan Y', 'Calabrese C', 'Rehg JE', 'Campana D', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Baker SD']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['djr107 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djr107 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2011 Jun 8;103(11):893-905. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djr107.

Thus, quantitative analysis of CML and its progression to blast crisis may help elucidate general mechanisms of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Hitherto, it has been widely postulated that CML blast crisis originates mainly via cell-autonomous mechanisms such as secondary mutations or genomic instability. However, recent results suggest that carcinogenic transformation may be an inherently multicellular event, in departure from the classic unicellular paradigm. We investigate this possibility in the case of blast crisis origination in CML. A quantitative, mechanistic cell population dynamics model was employed. This model used recent data on imatinib-treated CML; it also used earlier clinical data, not previously incorporated into current mathematical CML/imatinib models. With the pre-imatinib data, which include results on many more blast crises, we obtained evidence that the driving mechanism for blast crisis origination is a cooperation between specific cell types. Assuming leukemic-normal interactions resulted in a statistically significant improvement over assuming either cell-autonomous mechanisms or interactions between leukemic cells. This conclusion was robust with regard to changes in the model's adjustable parameters. Application of the results to patients treated with imatinib suggests that imatinib may act not only on malignant blast precursors, but also, to a limited degree, on the malignant blasts themselves.","['Sachs, Rainer K', 'Johnsson, Kerstin', 'Hahnfeldt, Philip', 'Luo, Janet', 'Chen, Allen', 'Hlatky, Lynn']","['Sachs RK', 'Johnsson K', 'Hahnfeldt P', 'Luo J', 'Chen A', 'Hlatky L']","['Department of Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. sachs@math.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-4600 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4600 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 15;71(8):2838-47. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4600.

IRF8-deficient mice exhibit uncontrolled clonal expansion of undifferentiated myeloid cells that can progress to a fatal blast crisis, thereby resembling human chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML). Therefore, IRF8 is a myeloid leukemia suppressor. Whereas the understanding of IRF8 function in CML has recently improved, the molecular mechanisms underlying IRF8 function in CML are still largely unknown. In this study, we identified acid ceramidase (A-CDase) as a general transcription target of IRF8. We demonstrated that IRF8 expression is regulated by IRF8 promoter DNA methylation in myeloid leukemia cells. Restoration of IRF8 expression repressed A-CDase expression, resulting in C16 ceramide accumulation and increased sensitivity of CML cells to FasL-induced apoptosis. In myeloid cells derived from IRF8-deficient mice, A-CDase protein level was dramatically increased. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IRF8 directly binds to the A-CDase promoter. At the functional level, inhibition of A-CDase activity, silencing A-CDase expression, or application of exogenous C16 ceramide sensitized CML cells to FasL-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of A-CDase decreased CML cells' sensitivity to FasL-induced apoptosis. Consequently, restoration of IRF8 expression suppressed CML development in vivo at least partially through a Fas-dependent mechanism. In summary, our findings determine the mechanism of IRF8 downregulation in CML cells and they determine a primary pathway of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis and disease progression.","['Hu, Xiaolin', 'Yang, Dafeng', 'Zimmerman, Mary', 'Liu, Feiyan', 'Yang, Jine', 'Kannan, Swati', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Szulc, Zdzislaw', 'Bielawska, Alicja', 'Ozato, Keiko', 'Bhalla, Kapil', 'Liu, Kebin']","['Hu X', 'Yang D', 'Zimmerman M', 'Liu F', 'Yang J', 'Kannan S', 'Burchert A', 'Szulc Z', 'Bielawska A', 'Ozato K', 'Bhalla K', 'Liu K']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Cancer Center, Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, Georgia 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-2493 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2493 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 15;71(8):2882-91. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2493.

Accurate diagnosis is important for appropriate risk stratification for treatment. It could be improved by understanding the initiating mechanism. iAMP21 is characterized by amplification of a 5.1-24 Mb region of chromosome 21, which includes the RUNX1 gene. It is thought to arise through a breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) mechanism. Breakpoints initiating BFB cycles were determined from recent array data from 18 patients. Three occurred within the PDE9A gene. Other patients with breakpoints in PDE9A were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular copy number counting. Sequencing defined a 1.7 Kb breakpoint cluster region, positioned 400 bp distal to an extensive region enriched for CA repeats with the potential to form Z-DNA. None of the rearranged sequences showed the inverted repeat structure characteristic of BFB; instead PDE9A was fused to intergenic regions of chromosome 21 or to genes on other chromosomes. These observations indicated that previously unrecognized complex events, involving microhomology-mediated end joining, preceded or accompanied initiation of the BFB cycle. A chi-like heptomer, CCTCAGC, contained four of the breakpoints, two within PDE9A and two within partner Alu-repeat sequences. This heptomer was closely homologous to a breakpoint hotspot within the TCF3 gene, suggesting involvement of a common novel recombinogenic mechanism that might also contribute to the recombinogenic potential of Alu repeats. These findings provide insight into potential mechanisms involved in the formation of iAMP21.","['Sinclair, Paul B', 'Parker, Helen', 'An, Qian', 'Rand, Vikki', 'Ensor, Hannah', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Strefford, Jonathan C']","['Sinclair PB', 'Parker H', 'An Q', 'Rand V', 'Ensor H', 'Harrison CJ', 'Strefford JC']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['ddr159 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddr159 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2011 Jul 1;20(13):2591-602. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr159.

Thus, quantitative monitoring of the emergence and expansion of T315I-positive subclones may be clinically useful. The goals of this study were to retrospectively review the authors' experience with Sanger sequencing-based BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation testing, paying particular attention to the T315I mutation, and to develop an alternative test for relative quantification of T315I using pyrosequencing. METHODS: The performance of a new T315I pyrosequencing assay was evaluated. Total RNA was isolated from whole blood and reverse-transcribed. The resulting cDNA was subjected to an initial round of PCR across the BCR-ABL1 breakpoint followed by a second round to amplify the sequence flanking ABL1 codon 315. The final PCR product was pyrosequenced to detect and quantify the T315I point mutation. Additional experiments were carried out to determine the effects of background untranslocated ABL1 on assay sensitivity in samples with low tumour burden. RESULTS: The results show that T315I was the most commonly detected kinase domain mutation and was persistent in follow-up testing. All 26 specimens that tested positive by Sanger sequencing for the T315I mutation were also positive using the pyrosequencing test. Relative quantification data derived from pyrosequencing matched the approximate wild-type/mutant ratios found by Sanger sequencing. Serial dilution experiments show sensitivity to 5% mutant allele. The authors also quantitatively assessed the influence of untranslocated ABL1 in the sample background on the assay and found that it occurred at levels not likely to influence performance. CONCLUSION: The described test is useful for detection and relative quantification of the T315I point mutation in chronic myelogenous leukaemia in a sensitive, specific and reproducible manner.","['Schumacher, Jonathan A', 'Szankasi, Philippe', 'Bahler, David W', 'Ho, Albert K', 'Kelley, Todd W']","['Schumacher JA', 'Szankasi P', 'Bahler DW', 'Ho AK', 'Kelley TW']","['ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/11/05 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jcp.2011.089193 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2011.089193 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2011 Jul;64(7):618-25. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2011.089193.

Cellular interactions and factors provided by the microenvironment appear essential to cell survival and may protect leukemic cells from the cytotoxicity of conventional therapies. Understanding the cross-talk between leukemic cells and stroma is of interest for identifying signals supporting disease progression and for developing novel therapeutic strategies. DESIGN AND METHODS: Different cell types, sharing a common mesenchymal origin and representative of various bone marrow components, were used to challenge the viability of leukemic cells in co-cultures and in contact-free culture systems. Using a bioinformatic approach we searched for genes shared by lineages prolonging leukemic cell survival and further analyzed their biological role in signal transduction experiments. RESULTS: Human bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts, trabecular bone-derived cells and an osteoblast-like cell line strongly enhanced survival of leukemic cells, while endothelial cells and chondrocytes did not. Gene expression profile analysis indicated two soluble factors, hepatocyte growth factor and CXCL12, as potentially involved. We demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor and CXCL12 are produced only by mesenchymal lineages that sustain the survival of leukemic cells. Indeed chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells express a functional hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET) and hepatocyte growth factor enhanced the viability of these cells through STAT3 phosphorylation, which was blocked by a c-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The role of hepatocyte growth factor was confirmed by its short interfering RNA-mediated knock-down in mesenchymal cells. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that hepatocyte growth factor prolongs the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells is novel and we suggest that the interaction between hepatocyte growth factor-producing mesenchymal and neoplastic cells contributes to maintenance of the leukemic clone.","['Giannoni, Paolo', 'Scaglione, Silvia', 'Quarto, Rodolfo', 'Narcisi, Roberto', 'Parodi, Manuela', 'Balleari, Enrico', 'Barbieri, Federica', 'Pattarozzi, Alessandra', 'Florio, Tullio', 'Ferrini, Silvano', 'Corte, Giorgio', 'de Totero, Daniela']","['Giannoni P', 'Scaglione S', 'Quarto R', 'Narcisi R', 'Parodi M', 'Balleari E', 'Barbieri F', 'Pattarozzi A', 'Florio T', 'Ferrini S', 'Corte G', 'de Totero D']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Advanced Biotechnology Center, 16132 Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/10/27 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.029736 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.029736 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Jul;96(7):1015-23. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.029736.

Our objective was to identify T-cell subsets with reduced in vitro reactivity to allogeneic HLA antigens. DESIGN AND METHODS: We sorted CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets from peripheral blood by flow cytometry according to their expression of naive and memory markers CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, and CCR7. Subsets were defined by a single marker to facilitate future establishment of a clinical-grade procedure for reducing alloreactive T-cell precursors and graft-versus-host disease. T cells were stimulated in mixed lymphocyte reactions against HLA-deficient K562 cells transfected with single HLA-A/-B/-C/-DR/-DQ mismatch alleles. Alloreactivity was measured by interferon-gamma spot production and cell proliferation. RESULTS: We observed that allogeneic HLA-reactivity was preferentially derived from subsets enriched for naive T cells rather than memory T cells in healthy donors, irrespective of the HLA mismatch allele. This separation was most efficient if CD45RA (versus other markers) was used for sorting. The numbers of allogeneic HLA-reactive effector cells were in median 7.2-fold and 16.6-fold lower in CD45RA(neg) memory CD8 and CD4 T cells than in entire CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively. In contrast, proliferation of memory T cells in response to allogeneic HLA was more variably reduced (CD8) or equivalent (CD4) when compared to that of naive T cells. We also demonstrated in HLA-matched donor-patient pairs that leukemia-reactive CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes were mainly derived from subsets enriched for naive T cells compared to memory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Memory T-cell subsets of most healthy individuals showed decreased allogeneic HLA-reactivity, but lacked significant anti-leukemia responses in vitro. The clinical use of memory or naive-depleted T cells might be beneficial for HLA-mismatched patients at high risk of graft-versus-host disease and low risk of leukemia relapse.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of bisulphite-treated DNA is a processing step that is common to many currently used methods of quantitative methylation analysis. Preferential amplification of unmethylated alleles-known as PCR-bias-may significantly affect the accuracy of quantification. To date, no universal experimental approach has been reported to overcome the problem. This study presents an effective method of correcting biased methylation data. The procedure includes a calibration performed in parallel to the analysis of the samples under investigation. DNA samples with defined degrees of methylation are analysed. The observed deviation of the experimental results from the expected values is used for calculating a regression curve. The equation of the best-fitting curve is then used for correction of the data obtained from the samples of interest. The process can be applied irrespective of the locus interrogated and the number of sites analysed, avoiding an optimization of the amplification conditions for each individual locus.","['Moskalev, Evgeny A', 'Zavgorodnij, Mikhail G', 'Majorova, Svetlana P', 'Vorobjev, Ivan A', 'Jandaghi, Pouria', 'Bure, Irina V', 'Hoheisel, Jorg D']","['Moskalev EA', 'Zavgorodnij MG', 'Majorova SP', 'Vorobjev IA', 'Jandaghi P', 'Bure IV', 'Hoheisel JD']","['Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. e.moskalev@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['gkr213 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkr213 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jun;39(11):e77. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr213.

Backbone of management are prophylaxis, early diagnosis and early initiation of antifungals for reduction of invasive aspergillosis related mortality. Randomized trials have been undertaken for the prophylaxis as well as treatment of invasive aspergillosis in the last two decades. Posaconazole is recommended for prophylaxis against aspergillosis in patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or patients with graft versus host disease after allogeneic transplantation. Efficacy has been shown for first-line therapy of invasive aspergillosis with voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B. Gastrointestinal resorption for the azoles posaconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole differ considerably. While oral voriconazole resportion is reduced when taken with food, posaconazole has to be taken with fatty food for optimal intestinal resorption. Beside all advances in the management of invasive aspergillosis important questions remain unresolved.

METHODS: Tanreqing injection was diluted to a series of concentrations (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128, 1:256 and 1:512) by volume and then independently applied to treat chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells and T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia Molt4 cells at the proliferative stage. Cell growth was observed at different time intervals under a microscope. Cell proliferation was determined by cell counting kit-8 assay and the survival curve was delineated. The inhibitory rate and the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) were calculated. Molt4 cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and PI/Annexin V and then the cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by using flow cytometry. In addition, a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was subjected to detect the expressions of apoptosis-related genes (bcl-2 and caspase-3) after Tanreqing treatment. RESULTS: Tanreqing injection had inhibitory effects on the proliferation of K562 cells and Molt4 cells. The most toxic concentrations were observed between 1:2 and 1:16 where cells were almost necrotic. The inhibitory effect manifested in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The IC50 of K562 and Molt4 was 1:333 and 1:142, respectively. After 1:32 Tanreqing injection treatment for 72 h, the number of Molt4 cells in the S phase significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the apoptosis rate markedly increased (P<0.05). In addition, increased caspase-3 expression and decreased bcl-2 expression were also observed (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Tanreqing injection can both inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of leukemia cells in vitro, whereby the potential mechanism seems to be mediated in part by decreasing S phase ratio, down-regulating bcl-2 expression and up-regulating caspase-3 expression.","['Yang, Bo', 'Lu, Xue-chun', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhu, Hong-li']","['Yang B', 'Lu XC', 'Zhang F', 'Liu Y', 'Zhu HL']","['Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao,Zhong xi yi jie he xue bao = Journal of Chinese integrative medicine,101199657,2011/04/14 06:00,2012/03/08 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jcim20110411 [pii]', '10.3736/jcim20110411 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao. 2011 Apr;9(4):414-22. doi: 10.3736/jcim20110411.,,,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (tanreqing)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 protein was the first member to be discovered and associated with drug resistance in human lymphomas. Since then a host of other proteins such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2A1 and Mcl-1 with similar anti-apoptotic functions have been identified. In contrast, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins contain prototypic effector proteins such as Bax and Bak, and the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology)-only proteins comprising Bak, Bid, Bim, Puma and Noxa. A complex interplay between the association of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins with each other determines the sensitivity of cancer cells to drug-induced apoptosis. The canonical functional of Bcl-2 in terms of apoptosis inhibition is its ability to prevent mitochondrial permeabilization via inhibiting the translocation and oligomerization of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax; however, more recent evidence points to a novel mechanism of the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2. Overexpression of Bcl-2 increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption and in doing so generates a slight pro-oxidant intracellular milieu, which promotes genomic instability and blocks death signalling. However, in the wake of overt oxidative stress, Bcl-2 regulates cellular redox status thereby preventing excessive build-up of ROS (reactive oxygen species), which is detrimental to cells and tissues. Taken together, the canonical and non-canonical activities of Bcl-2 imply a critical involvement of this protein in the processes of tumour initiation and progression. In the present paper we review these functionally distinct outcomes of Bcl-2 expression with implications for the chemotherapeutic management of cancers.","['Krishna, Shefali', 'Low, Ivan Cherh Chiet', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Krishna S', 'Low IC', 'Pervaiz S']","['Apoptosis, ROS and Cancer Biology Program, Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20101996 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20101996 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2011 May 1;435(3):545-51. doi: 10.1042/BJ20101996.,10.1042/BJ20101996 [doi],,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conducting controlled randomized trials to assess the effective therapeutic strategies has therefore been a significant challenge to date. AREAS COVERED: This review explores the natural history and diagnostic evaluation of ATL, followed by a focused review of existing studies on the most potent individual pharmaceutical agents and combinations used in the therapy of this malignancy. Readers will acquire considerable insights about the clinical subsets, diagnosis and the most effective therapies used in various ATL types. EXPERT OPINION: International, multicenter, randomized clinical trials are essential to design optimal therapeutic strategies for various ATL subsets. It appears that patients with acute ATL type benefit considerably from the first-line combined antiviral therapy with zidovudine and interferon alpha, whereas patients with ATL of the lymphoma type may experience a better outcome with intensive chemotherapy. The role of therapy in smoldering and chronic disease types remains to be clarified. In addition, the results of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in ATL appear promising, as up to 40% of patients who achieve remission and have suitable donors can now become long-term survivors. Prospective evaluation of novel effective agents and their incorporation into various therapeutic algorithms is stringently needed.","['Dasanu, Constantin A']",['Dasanu CA'],"['St Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hartford, CT, USA. c_dasanu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2011.571207 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2011 Aug;12(11):1709-17. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2011.571207.

However, compared to the PBMC assay it will not reveal any effect on the T-cell interaction.","['Schroecksnadel, Sebastian', 'Jenny, Marcel', 'Fuchs, Dietmar']","['Schroecksnadel S', 'Jenny M', 'Fuchs D']","['Division of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,101230869,2011/04/14 06:00,2011/06/02 06:00,['2011/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jbn.2011.1272 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Nanotechnol. 2011 Feb;7(1):209-10. doi: 10.1166/jbn.2011.1272.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*administration & dosage', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: First a serial of assays were performed using MTT, transmission electron microscopy, Annexin V FITC/PI double-stain, flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy to qualitatively and quantitatively observe the in vitro apoptosis inducing effect of realgar on RA-resistant cells. Then the comparative proteomic profile before and after NB4-R1 apoptosis was established using high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis system. RESULTS: The inhibition effect of realgar on NB4-R1 cell growth was dose and time dependent. The 24-h 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) was 24.06 +/- 0.19 micromol/L, and the 48-h IC50 9.50 +/- 0.13 micromol/L, and 72-h IC50 6.55 +/- 0.03 micromol/L, respectively. 24 h and 48 h were the early and late phase of major NB4-R1 apoptotic cell populations induced by 25 micromol/L realgar respectively. Differential proteomic profiles before and after realgar induced NB4-R1 apoptosis were successfully established.

The mutations and succeeding genetic events are thought to cause LFS-associated cancer, whose genetic alterations have rarely been investigated. Here, we study two LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFLS) patients whose cancers showed aggressive phenotypes. Patient 1 with LFS and TP53(R273H) developed a rhabdomyosarcoma twice at the ages of 18 months and 21 years. A single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based analysis revealed two amplicons in the second tumor; one at 5q11.2 containing MAP3K1 and the other at 11q22.2 containing BIRC2/3 and YAP1. Increase of kinase signaling of MAP3K1 along with anti-apoptosis function of BIRC2/3 may have facilitated progression of this tumor. Patient 2 with LFLS and wild-typeTP53 suffered from acute myeloid leukemia. The leukemic cells had TP53(I195T) and two amplicons; one at 8q24.1 containing DEPDC6 and the other at 8q24.2 containing TRIB1, MYC, and PVT1. Quantitative PCR confirmed amplification of the genes and FISH revealed co-amplification of DEPDC6 and PVT1 in the same double minutes. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed increased expression levels of TRIB1, but no or little expression of DEPDC6, MYC, and PVT1. The results indicate that TRIB1 may be the target gene in the amplicon in the leukemia cells. Mutant TP53 can be engaged in pathways triggering gene amplification through impairment of DNA double-stranded break repair. The amplified candidate oncogenes identified in this study may have played a part in cancer development and lead to the poor outcome of LFS or LFLS-associated tumors.","['Sugawara, Waka', 'Arai, Yasuhito', 'Kasai, Fumio', 'Fujiwara, Yuiko', 'Haruta, Masayuki', 'Hosaka, Rie', 'Nishida, Kazunori', 'Kurosumi, Masashi', 'Kobayashi, Yasuhito', 'Akagi, Kiwamu', 'Kaneko, Yasuhiko']","['Sugawara W', 'Arai Y', 'Kasai F', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Haruta M', 'Hosaka R', 'Nishida K', 'Kurosumi M', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Akagi K', 'Kaneko Y']","['Department of Cancer Diagnosis, Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Ina, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20878 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Jul;50(7):535-45. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20878.

One innovative strategy is to inhibit the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) responsible for the regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In our study, we investigated the detailed cellular mechanism of a novel small-molecule CDK inhibitor (CDKI-71) in cancer cell lines, primary leukemia cells, normal B - & T- cells, and embryonic lung fibroblasts and compared the cellular and molecular responses to the clinical CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol. Like flavopiridol, CDKI-71 displayed potent cytotoxicity and caspase-dependent apoptosis induction that were closely associated with the inhibition of RNAPII phosphorylation at serine-2. This was caused by effective targeting of cyclinT-CDK9 and resulted in the downstream inhibition of Mcl-1. No correlation between apoptosis and inhibition of cell-cycle CDKs 1 and 2 was observed. CDKI-71 showed a 10-fold increase in potency in tumor cell lines when compared to MRC-5 human fibroblast cells. Significantly, CDKI-71 also demonstrated potent anti-chronic lymphocytic leukemia activity with minimal toxicity in normal B- and T-cells. In contrast, flavopiridol showed little selectivity between cancer and normal cells. Here, we provide the first cell-based evidence that flavopiridol induces DNA double-strand breaks: a fact which may explain why flavopiridol has such a narrow therapeutic window in preclinical and clinical settings. Taken together, our data provide a rationale for the development of selective CDK inhibitors as therapeutic agents and CDKI-71 represents a promising lead in this context.","['Liu, Xiangrui', 'Shi, Shenhua', 'Lam, Frankie', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Fischer, Peter M', 'Wang, Shudong']","['Liu X', 'Shi S', 'Lam F', 'Pepper C', 'Fischer PM', 'Wang S']","['School of Pharmacy and Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,2011/04/13 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26127 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Mar 1;130(5):1216-26. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26127.

We retrospectively analyzed outcomes in 142 patients who failed to achieve CR with standard anthracycline-plus-cytarabine induction chemotherapy (IND1) and who received the same regimen as a reduction therapy (IND2). The CR rate after reinduction was 54%. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of peripheral blood (PB) blasts on the day of commencement of IND2 and >/=20% blasts in an interim BM sample taken during IND1 (C1-INT-BM) were independent risk factors for failure of remission. Our scoring system for prediction of CR after reinduction (CRAR score) included a favorable chromosome risk group, absence of PB blasts on the day of commencement of IND2, and </=21% blasts in the C1-INT-BM. This scoring system predicted that the rates of CR in the four subgroups would be 92.1%, 68.9%, 29.5%, and 7.3%, respectively, in good agreement with observed CR rates. The CRAR scoring model might be associated with the possibility of achieving CR after reinduction, and may be helpful in choosing alternative strategy for AML patients refractory to standard induction chemotherapy, although further prospective validation is required.","['Kim, Dae-Young', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Sym, Sun Jin', 'Yun, Sung-Cheol', 'Lee, Jung-Hee', 'Kim, Sung-Doo', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Lee, Young-Shin', 'Kang, Young-Ah', 'Jeon, Mijin', 'Seol, Miee', 'Lee, Kyung-Hwa', 'Lee, Yeon-Joo', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung']","['Kim DY', 'Lee JH', 'Sym SJ', 'Yun SC', 'Lee JH', 'Kim SD', 'Choi Y', 'Lee YS', 'Kang YA', 'Jeon M', 'Seol M', 'Lee KH', 'Lee YJ', 'Lee KH']","['Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asanbyeongwon-gil 86, Songpa-gu, Seoul 138-736, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1228-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Nov;90(11):1283-91. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1228-x.

Here, we studied a neem extract's anti-inflammatory potential via the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway, linked to cancer, inflammation, and apoptosis. Cultured human leukemia cells were treated with a methanolic neem leaf extract with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulation. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity was demonstrated by luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Inhibition of viability by neem extracts was assessed by luminescent assays. Western blot analysis allowed assessing the inhibitory effect of the neem extract on TNF-alpha-induced degradation of inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) and nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer. Inhibition of IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity was shown as well as the effect of neem extract on the induction of apoptotic cell death mechanisms by nuclear fragmentation analysis and flow cytometry analysis. In conclusion, our data provide evidence for a strong effect of the neem extract on pro-inflammatory cell signaling and apoptotic cell death mechanisms, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms triggered by Azadirachta indica.","['Schumacher, Marc', 'Cerella, Claudia', 'Reuter, Simone', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Schumacher M', 'Cerella C', 'Reuter S', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Genes Nutr,Genes & nutrition,101280108,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/04/13 06:01,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12263-010-0194-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Nutr. 2011 May;6(2):149-60. doi: 10.1007/s12263-010-0194-6.

A transgenic mouse that expresses HTLV-1 Tax also develops T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and an inflammatory arthropathy that resembles rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to identify the primary T-cell subsets involved in the development of arthropathy in Tax transgenic mice. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By 24 months of age, Tax transgenic mice developed severe arthropathy with a cumulative incidence of 22.8%. The pathological findings of arthropathy in Tax transgenic mice were similar to those seen in human rheumatoid arthritis or mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, with synovial proliferation and a positive rheumatoid factor. Before the onset of spontaneous arthropathy, young and old Tax transgenic mice were not sensitive to collagen and did not develop arthritis after immunization with type II collagen. The arthropathic Tax transgenic mice showed a significantly decreased proportion of splenic CD4(+) T cells, whereas the proportion of splenic CD8(+) T cells was increased. Regulatory T cells (CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)) were significantly decreased and CD8(+) T cells that expressed the chemokine receptor CCR4 (CD8(+)CCR4(+)) were significantly increased in arthropathic Tax transgenic mice. The expression of tax mRNA was strong in the spleen and joints of arthropathic mice, with a 40-fold increase compared with healthy transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that Tax transgenic mice develop rheumatoid-like arthritis with proliferating synovial cells in the joints; however, the proportion of different splenic T-cell subsets in these mice was completely different from other commonly used animal models of rheumatoid arthritis. The crucial T-cell subsets in arthropathic Tax transgenic mice appear to resemble those in HAM/TSP patients rather than those in rheumatoid arthritis patients.","['Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Kumasaka, Toshio']","['Ohsugi T', 'Kumasaka T']","['Division of Microbiology and Genetics, Center for Animal Resources and Development, Institute of Resource Development and Analysis, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. ohsugi@gpo.kumamoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/07/21 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0018518 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Apr 1;6(4):e18518. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018518.,10.1371/journal.pone.0018518 [doi],20110401,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Collagen Type II)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/chemically induced/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Collagen Type II/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, CCR4/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology/metabolism']",,PMC3069963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is clear that these factors target retrovirus capsid proteins (CA), recognition remains poorly defined in the absence of structural information. To better understand the binding interaction between TRIM5alpha and CA, we selected a panel of novel N-tropic murine leukaemia virus (N-MLV) escape mutants by a serial passage of replication competent N-MLV in rhesus macaque TRIM5alpha (rhTRIM5alpha)-positive cells using a small percentage of unrestricted cells to allow multiple rounds of virus replication. The newly identified mutations, many of which involve changes in charge, are distributed over the outer 'top' surface of N-MLV CA, including the N-terminal beta-hairpin, and map up to 29 A(o) apart. Biological characterisation with a number of restriction factors revealed that only one of the new mutations affects restriction by human TRIM5alpha, indicating significant differences in the binding interaction between N-MLV and the two TRIM5alphas, whereas three of the mutations result in dual sensitivity to Fv1(n) and Fv1(b). Structural studies of two mutants show that no major changes in the overall CA conformation are associated with escape from restriction. We conclude that interactions involving much, if not all, of the surface of CA are vital for TRIM5alpha binding.","['Ohkura, Sadayuki', 'Goldstone, David C', 'Yap, Melvyn W', 'Holden-Dye, Kate', 'Taylor, Ian A', 'Stoye, Jonathan P']","['Ohkura S', 'Goldstone DC', 'Yap MW', 'Holden-Dye K', 'Taylor IA', 'Stoye JP']","['Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002011 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Mar;7(3):e1002011. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002011.

Clozapine provides effective treatments for schizophrenia but its usage is limited because of life-threatening agranulocytosis. A recent high impact study showed the necessity of moving clozapine to a first line drug, thus identifying the biomarkers for drug-induced agranulocytosis has become important. Here we report a methodology termed as antithesis chemical-protein interactome (CPI), which utilizes the docking method to mimic the differences in the drug-protein interactions across a panel of human proteins. Using this method, we identified HSPA1A, a known susceptibility gene for CIA, to be the off-target of clozapine. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of HSPA1A-related genes (off-target associated systems) was also found to be differentially expressed in clozapine treated leukemia cell line. Apart from identifying the CIA causal genes we identified several novel candidate genes which could be responsible for agranulocytosis. Proteins related to reactive oxygen clearance system, such as oxidoreductases and glutathione metabolite enzymes, were significantly enriched in the antithesis CPI. This methodology conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of drugs' perturbation to the biological system, investigating both the off-targets and the associated off-systems to explore the molecular basis of an adverse event or the new uses for old drugs.","['Yang, Lun', 'Wang, Kejian', 'Chen, Jian', 'Jegga, Anil G', 'Luo, Heng', 'Shi, Leming', 'Wan, Chunling', 'Guo, Xizhi', 'Qin, Shengying', 'He, Guang', 'Feng, Guoyin', 'He, Lin']","['Yang L', 'Wang K', 'Chen J', 'Jegga AG', 'Luo H', 'Shi L', 'Wan C', 'Guo X', 'Qin S', 'He G', 'Feng G', 'He L']","['Bio-X Center, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. lun.yang@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/07/23 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002016 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2011 Mar;7(3):e1002016. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002016.

Together, these findings suggest that the addition of a MEK inhibitor improves the ability of BMS-214662 to selectively target CML stem/progenitor cells, notoriously insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and presumed to be responsible for the persistence and relapse of the disease.","['Pellicano, F', 'Simara, P', 'Sinclair, A', 'Helgason, G V', 'Copland, M', 'Grant, S', 'Holyoake, T L']","['Pellicano F', 'Simara P', 'Sinclair A', 'Helgason GV', 'Copland M', 'Grant S', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201167 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.67 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jul;25(7):1159-67. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.67.

To speed up isolation of these cells, we employed anti-CD133-conjugated paramagnetic beads followed by staining with Aldefluor to detect aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity; we subsequently sorted CD45(-)/GlyA(-)/CD133(+)/ALDH(high) and CD45(-)/GlyA(-)/CD133(+)/ALDH(low) cells, which are enriched for VSELs, and CD45(+)/GlyA /CD133(+)/ALDH(high) and CD45(+)/GlyA(-)/CD133(+)/ALDH(low) cells, which are enriched for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Although freshly isolated CD45(-) VSELs did not grow hematopoietic colonies, the same cells, when activated/expanded over OP9 stromal support, acquired hematopoietic potential and grew colonies composed of CD45(+) hematopoietic cells in methylcellulose cultures. We also observed that CD45(-)/GlyA(-)/CD133(+)/ALDH(high) VSELs grew colonies earlier than CD45(-)/GlyA(-)/CD133(+)/ALDH(low) VSELs, which suggests that the latter cells need more time to acquire hematopoietic commitment. In support of this possibility, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that, whereas freshly isolated CD45(-)/GlyA(-)/CD133(+)/ALDH(high) VSELs express more hematopoietic transcripts (for example, c-myb), CD45(-)/GlyA(-)/CD133(+)/ALDH(low) VSELs exhibit higher levels of pluripotent stem cell markers (for example, Oct-4). More importantly, hematopoietic cells derived from VSELs that were co-cultured over OP9 support were able to establish human lympho-hematopoietic chimerism in lethally irradiated non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice 4-6 weeks after transplantation. Overall, our data suggest that UCB-VSELs correspond to the most primitive population of HSPCs in UCB.","['Ratajczak, J', 'Zuba-Surma, E', 'Klich, I', 'Liu, R', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Greco, N', 'Kucia, M', 'Laughlin, M J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Ratajczak J', 'Zuba-Surma E', 'Klich I', 'Liu R', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Greco N', 'Kucia M', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201173 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.73 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1278-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.73.

The stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 axis is a major determinant in the crosstalk between leukemic cells and BM stroma. In this study, we investigated the use of AMD11070, an orally available, small-molecule antagonist of CXCR4, as an ALL-sensitizing agent. This compound effectively blocked stromal-induced migration of human ALL cells in culture and disrupted pre-established adhesion to stroma. To examine how to optimally use this compound in vivo, several combinations with cytotoxic drugs were tested in a stromal co-culture system. The best treatment regimen was then tested in vivo. Mice transplanted with murine Bcr/Abl ALL cells survived significantly longer when treated with a combination of nilotinib and AMD11070. Similarly, immunocompromised mice transplanted with human ALL cells and treated with vincristine and AMD11070 had few circulating leukemic cells, normal spleens and reduced human CD19+ cells in the BM at the termination of the experiment. These results show that combined treatment with AMD11070 may be of significant benefit in eradicating residual leukemia cells at locations where they would otherwise be protected by stroma.","['Parameswaran, R', 'Yu, M', 'Lim, M', 'Groffen, J', 'Heisterkamp, N']","['Parameswaran R', 'Yu M', 'Lim M', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology and The Saban Research Institute of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201176 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.76 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1314-23. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.76.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred thirty-three patients (median age, 70 years; range, 60 to 90 years) were enrolled; 53% had poor-risk cytogenetics, and the median MDS duration at random assignment was 3 months. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Decitabine (15 mg/m(2)) was given intravenously over 4 hours three times a day for 3 days in 6-week cycles. RESULTS: OS prolongation with decitabine versus BSC was not statistically significant (median OS, 10.1 v 8.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.17; two-sided, log-rank P = .38). Progression-free survival (PFS), but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML) -free survival (AMLFS), was significantly prolonged with decitabine versus BSC (median PFS, 6.6 v 3.0 months, respectively; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.88; P = .004; median AMLFS, 8.8 v 6.1 months, respectively; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.12; P = .24). AML transformation was significantly (P = .036) reduced at 1 year (from 33% with BSC to 22% with decitabine). Multivariate analyses indicated that patients with short MDS duration had worse outcomes. Best responses with decitabine versus BSC, respectively, were as follows: complete response (13% v 0%), partial response (6% v 0%), hematologic improvement (15% v 2%), stable disease (14% v 22%), progressive disease (29% v 68%), hypoplasia (14% v 0%), and inevaluable (8% v 8%). Grade 3 to 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 25% of patients on decitabine versus 7% of patients on BSC; grade 3 to 4 infections occurred in 57% and 52% of patients on decitabine and BSC, respectively. Decitabine treatment was associated with improvements in patient-reported quality-of-life (QOL) parameters. CONCLUSION: Decitabine administered in 6-week cycles is active in older patients with higher-risk MDS, resulting in improvements of OS and AMLFS (nonsignificant), of PFS and AML transformation (significant), and of QOL. Short MDS duration was an independent adverse prognosticator.","['Lubbert, Michael', 'Suciu, Stefan', 'Baila, Liliana', 'Ruter, Bjorn Hans', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Selleslag, Dominik', 'Labar, Boris', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Beeldens, Filip', 'Muus, Petra', 'Pfluger, Karl-Heinz', 'Coens, Corneel', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Eckart Schaefer, Hans', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Aul, Carlo', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Wijermans, Pierre W']","['Lubbert M', 'Suciu S', 'Baila L', 'Ruter BH', 'Platzbecker U', 'Giagounidis A', 'Selleslag D', 'Labar B', 'Germing U', 'Salih HR', 'Beeldens F', 'Muus P', 'Pfluger KH', 'Coens C', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Eckart Schaefer H', 'Ganser A', 'Aul C', 'de Witte T', 'Wijermans PW']","['Albert Ludwigs University, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.30.9245 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.30.9245 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 May 20;29(15):1987-96. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.30.9245.

We aimed to address the frequency and prognostic value of TP53 abnormalities in patients with CLL in the context of a prospective randomized trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 529 CLL samples from the LRF CLL4 (Leukaemia Research Foundation Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 4) trial (chlorambucil v fludarabine with or without cyclophosphamide) at the time of random assignment for mutations in the TP53 gene. TP53 mutation status was correlated with response and survival data. RESULTS: Mutations of TP53 were found in 40 patients (7.6%), including 25 (76%) of 33 with 17p deletion and 13 (3%) of 487 without that deletion. There was no significant correlation between TP53 mutations and age, stage, IGHV gene mutations, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, or any other chromosomal abnormality other than 17p deletion, in which concordance was high (96%). TP53 mutations were significantly associated with poorer overall response rates (27% v 83%; P < .001) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 5-year PFS: 5% v 17%; 5-year OS: 20% v 59%; P < .001 for both). Multivariate analysis that included baseline clinical variables, treatment, and known adverse genetic factors confirmed that TP53 mutations have added prognostic value. CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are associated with impaired response and shorter survival in patients with CLL. Analysis of TP53 mutations should be performed in patients with CLL who have progressive disease before starting first-line treatment, and those with mutations should be selected for novel experimental therapies.","['Gonzalez, David', 'Martinez, Pilar', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Hockley, Sarah', 'Oscier, David', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Dearden, Claire E', 'Richards, Sue M', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Morgan, Gareth J']","['Gonzalez D', 'Martinez P', 'Wade R', 'Hockley S', 'Oscier D', 'Matutes E', 'Dearden CE', 'Richards SM', 'Catovsky D', 'Morgan GJ']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom. davidg@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/07/29 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.0838 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.0838 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 1;29(16):2223-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.0838.

It comprises several domains, including a regulatory C terminus that is responsible for the interaction with numerous proteins such as p53, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), and Hsp27. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of two novel variants of Daxx termed Daxx-beta and Daxx-gamma, which are generated by alternative splicing. Alternative splicing results in a truncated regulatory C terminus in both proteins. As a consequence, Daxx-beta and Daxx-gamma show a markedly decreased affinity to PML, which in turn is associated with a different subnuclear localization of these proteins compared with Daxx. Although Daxx is localized mainly in PML-oncogenic domains (PODs) Daxx-beta and Daxx-gamma display a distinct distribution pattern. Furthermore, Daxx-beta and Daxx-gamma show a decreased affinity to p53 also due to the truncated C terminus. We provide evidence that the p53 recruitment into PODs is Daxx isoform-dependent. The decreased affinity of Daxx-beta/-gamma to p53 and PML results in a diffuse localization of p53 throughout the nucleus. In contrast to Daxx, Daxx-beta and Daxx-gamma are unable to repress p53-mediated transcription. Therefore, alternative splicing of Daxx might indicate an additional level in the cellular apoptosis network.","['Wethkamp, Nils', 'Hanenberg, Helmut', 'Funke, Sarah', 'Suschek, Christoph V', 'Wetzel, Wiebke', 'Heikaus, Sebastian', 'Grinstein, Edgar', 'Ramp, Uwe', 'Engers, Rainer', 'Gabbert, Helmut E', 'Mahotka, Csaba']","['Wethkamp N', 'Hanenberg H', 'Funke S', 'Suschek CV', 'Wetzel W', 'Heikaus S', 'Grinstein E', 'Ramp U', 'Engers R', 'Gabbert HE', 'Mahotka C']","['Institute of Pathology, Heinrich Heine University, University Hospital, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51036-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.196311 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 3;286(22):19576-88. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.196311.

We have investigated the clonal origins of relapse by comparing the profiles of genomewide copy number alterations at presentation in 21 patients with those in matched relapse (12-119 months). We identified, in total, 159 copy number alterations at presentation and 231 at relapse (excluding Ig/TCR). Deletions of CDKN2A/B or CCNC (6q16.2-3) or both increased from 38% at presentation to 76% in relapse, suggesting that cell-cycle deregulation contributed to emergence of relapse. A novel observation was recurrent gain of chromosome 16 (2 patients at presentation, 4 at relapse) and deletion of plasmocytoma variant translocation 1 in 3 patients. The data indicate that, irrespective of time to relapse, the relapse clone was derived from either a major or minor clone at presentation. Backtracking analysis by FISH identified a minor subclone at diagnosis whose genotype matched that observed in relapse approximately 10 years later. These data indicate subclonal diversity at diagnosis, providing a variable basis for intraclonal origins of relapse and extended periods (years) of dormancy, possibly by quiescence, for stem cells in ETV6-RUNX1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['van Delft, Frederik W', 'Horsley, Sharon', 'Colman, Sue', 'Anderson, Kristina', 'Bateman, Caroline', 'Kempski, Helena', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Kearney, Lyndal', 'Ford, Anthony', 'Greaves, Mel']","['van Delft FW', 'Horsley S', 'Colman S', 'Anderson K', 'Bateman C', 'Kempski H', 'Zuna J', 'Eckert C', 'Saha V', 'Kearney L', 'Ford A', 'Greaves M']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44967-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-10-314674 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 9;117(23):6247-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-10-314674.

Ponatinib also has in vitro inhibitory activity against a discrete set of kinases implicated in the pathogenesis of other hematologic malignancies, including FLT3, KIT, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha). Here, using leukemic cell lines containing activated forms of each of these receptors, we show that ponatinib potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation and cellular proliferation with IC50 values comparable to those required for inhibition of BCR-ABL (0.3 to 20 nmol/L). The activity of ponatinib against the FLT3-ITD mutant, found in up to 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, was particularly notable. In MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD(+/+)) but not RS4;11 (FLT3-ITD(-/-)) AML cells, ponatinib inhibited FLT3 signaling and induced apoptosis at concentrations of less than 10 nmol/L. In an MV4-11 mouse xenograft model, once daily oral dosing of ponatinib led to a dose-dependent inhibition of signaling and tumor regression. Ponatinib inhibited viability of primary leukemic blasts from a FLT3-ITD positive AML patient (IC50 4 nmol/L) but not those isolated from 3 patients with AML expressing native FLT3. Overall, these results support the investigation of ponatinib in patients with FLT3-ITD-driven AML and other hematologic malignancies driven by KIT, FGFR1, or PDGFRalpha.","['Gozgit, Joseph M', 'Wong, Matthew J', 'Wardwell, Scott', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Mohemmad, Qurish K', 'Narasimhan, Narayana I', 'Shakespeare, William C', 'Wang, Frank', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Clackson, Tim', 'Rivera, Victor M']","['Gozgit JM', 'Wong MJ', 'Wardwell S', 'Tyner JW', 'Loriaux MM', 'Mohemmad QK', 'Narasimhan NI', 'Shakespeare WC', 'Wang F', 'Druker BJ', 'Clackson T', 'Rivera VM']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 26 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-1044 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-1044 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Jun;10(6):1028-35. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-1044.

It also induces vascular hyperpermeability and protein leakage into the extracellular space. Leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)), one of the cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), is known to be one of the key molecules of allergic inflammation. The interaction between LTD(4) and VEGF production in human monocytes/macrophages is not well characterized. METHODS: We examined VEGF production by THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, and human peripheral blood CD14+monocytes/macrophages stimulated with LTD(4) and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We also determined the inhibitory effects of pranlukast, a CysLT(1) receptor antagonist, on VEGF production by LTD(4) stimulation. RESULTS: LTD(4) significantly induced VEGF production and enhanced TNF-alpha-induced VEGF release in THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood CD14+monocytes/macrophages. VEGF mRNA expression was also induced by stimulation of THP-1 cells with LTD(4) and TNF-alpha. In addition, 10(-7)-10(-10)M pranlukast completely inhibited VEGF production enhanced by LTD(4). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for VEGF production in THP-1 cells was 10(-10)-10(-11)M.

METHODS: The cDNAs encoding for the variable regions of heavy chain (V(H);) and light chain (V(L);) of AD5-10 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the human IgG heavy and light chain containing expression vector RpCI-neo, respectively. The recombinant plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 and/or CHO cells. The production of anti-DR5 human-mouse chimeric antibody (hmAD5-10) and the antibody affinity for DR5 were identified by ELISA and Western blot assay. The tumoricidal activity of hmAD5-10 was demonstrated by MTS assay. The stable expression cells were selected and cultured in serum-free medium. RESULTS: Two stable CHO cells CHO-A5 and CHO-B11 with the chimeric antibody hmAD5-10 expression were established, in which the production of hmAD5-10 were reached at (0.36+/-0.11) mg/L and (0.16+/-0.01) mg/L, respectively.

The first statistical tools developed were focused on the identification of significant differentially expressed genes. Later, researchers moved toward the systematic integration of gene expression profiles with additional biological information, such as chromosomal location, ontological annotations or sequence features. The analysis of gene expression linked to physical location of genes on chromosomes allows the identification of transcriptionally imbalanced regions, while, Gene Set Analysis focuses on the detection of coordinated changes in transcriptional levels among sets of biologically related genes. In this field, meta-analysis offers the possibility to compare different studies, addressing the same biological question to fully exploit public gene expression datasets. RESULTS: We describe STEPath, a method that starts from gene expression profiles and integrates the analysis of imbalanced region as an a priori step before performing gene set analysis. The application of STEPath in individual studies produced gene set scores weighted by chromosomal activation. As a final step, we propose a way to compare these scores across different studies (meta-analysis) on related biological issues. One complication with meta-analysis is batch effects, which occur because molecular measurements are affected by laboratory conditions, reagent lots and personnel differences. Major problems occur when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. We evaluated the power of combining chromosome mapping and gene set enrichment analysis, performing the analysis on a dataset of leukaemia (example of individual study) and on a dataset of skeletal muscle diseases (meta-analysis approach). In leukaemia, we identified the Hox gene set, a gene set closely related to the pathology that other algorithms of gene set analysis do not identify, while the meta-analysis approach on muscular disease discriminates between related pathologies and correlates similar ones from different studies. CONCLUSIONS: STEPath is a new method that integrates gene expression profiles, genomic co-expressed regions and the information about the biological function of genes. The usage of the STEPath-computed gene set scores overcomes batch effects in the meta-analysis approaches allowing the direct comparison of different pathologies and different studies on a gene set activation level.","['Martini, Paolo', 'Risso, Davide', 'Sales, Gabriele', 'Romualdi, Chiara', 'Lanfranchi, Gerolamo', 'Cagnin, Stefano']","['Martini P', 'Risso D', 'Sales G', 'Romualdi C', 'Lanfranchi G', 'Cagnin S']","['CRIBI Biotechnology Centre, Department of Biology, University of Padova, via U, Bassi 58/B, 35121 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-12-92 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-12-92 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2011 Apr 11;12:92. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-12-92.,10.1186/1471-2105-12-92 [doi],20110411,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genome', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Muscular Diseases/genetics', 'Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,PMC3094239,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ror1 is highly upregulated in B cells of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Molecularly, Ror1 acts as the Wnt receptor in the non-canonical Wnt pathway. METHODS: The level of Ror1 glycosylation in HEK293 cells and in primary human CLL cells was analysed by treatment of inhibitors interfering with different steps of glycosylation process and by direct treatment of cell lysates with N-glycosidase. Ror1 ubiquitination was determined by ubiquitination assay. Functional consequences of post-translational modifications were analysed by immunohistochemistry and by analysis of cell surface proteins. Differences in Ror1 glycosylation were confirmed by analysis of 14 samples of B cells from CLL patients. RESULTS: We demonstrate that Ror1 is extensively modified by N-linked glycosylation. Glycosylation produces several variants of Ror1 with electrophoretic migration of approx. 100, 115 and 130 kDa. Inhibition of glycosylation interferes with cell surface localization of the 130-kDa variant of Ror1 and prevents Ror1-induced formation of filopodia. Moreover, we show that 130-kDa Ror1 is mono-ubiquitinated. Furthermore, individual CLL patients show striking differences in the electrophoretic migration of Ror1, which correspond to the level of glycosylation. CONCLUSION: Our data show that Ror1 undergoes complex post-translational modifications by glycosylation and mono-ubiquitination. These modifications regulate Ror1 localization and signalling, and are highly variable among individual CLL patients. These may suggest that Ror1 signals only in a subset of CLL patients despite Ror1 levels are ubiquitously high in all CLL patients.","['Kaucka, M', 'Krejci, P', 'Plevova, K', 'Pavlova, S', 'Prochazkova, J', 'Janovska, P', 'Valnohova, J', 'Kozubik, A', 'Pospisilova, S', 'Bryja, V']","['Kaucka M', 'Krejci P', 'Plevova K', 'Pavlova S', 'Prochazkova J', 'Janovska P', 'Valnohova J', 'Kozubik A', 'Pospisilova S', 'Bryja V']","['Faculty of Science, Institute of Experimental Biology, Masaryk University, Kotlarska, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Physiol (Oxf),"Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",101262545,2011/04/13 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02306.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Physiol (Oxf). 2011 Nov;203(3):351-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02306.x.

A more specific method of contraception is needed. Contraceptive vaccines can provide most, if not all, the desired characteristics of an ideal contraceptive. This article reviews several factors involved in the establishment of pregnancy, focusing on those that are essential for successful implantation. Factors that are both essential and pregnancy-specific can provide potential targets for contraception. Using database search, 76 factors (cytokines/chemokines/growth factors/others) were identified that are involved in various steps of the establishment of pregnancy. Among these factors, three, namely chorionic gonadotropin (CG), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and pre-implantation factor (PIF), are found to be unique and exciting molecules. Human CG is a well-known pregnancy-specific protein that has undergone phase I and phase II clinical trials, in women, as a contraceptive vaccine with encouraging results. LIF and PIF are pregnancy-specific and essential for successful implantation. These molecules are intriguing and may provide viable targets for immunocontraception. A multiepitope vaccine combining factors/antigens involved in various steps of the fertilization cascade and pregnancy establishment may provide a highly immunogenic and efficacious modality for contraception in humans.","['Lemons, Angela R', 'Naz, Rajesh K']","['Lemons AR', 'Naz RK']","['Reproductive Immunology and Molecular Biology Laboratories, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, 1 Medical Center Drive, Morgantown, WV 26506-9186, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,2011/04/13 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01001.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2011 Jul;66(1):13-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01001.x.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blasts like K562 cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by DOX due to several reasons, the primary being the sequestration of drug into cytoplasmic vesicles and induction of multidrug resistance (MDR) gene expression with DOX treatment resulting in intracellular resistance to this drug. Moreover, expression of antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 and the hybrid gene bcr/abl in K562 cells contributes resistance to DOX. Studies have shown that curcumin (CUR) has a pleiotropic therapeutic effect in cancer treatment, as it is an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) as well as a potent downregulator of MDR transporters. In this study, we investigated the potential benefit of using DOX and CUR in a single nanoparticle (NP) formulation to inhibit the development of drug resistance for the enhancement of antiproliferative activity of DOX in K562 cells. Results illustrate that the dual (DOX+CUR) drug loaded NPs were effectively delivered into K562 cells. CUR not only facilitates the retention of DOX in nucleus for a longer period of time but also inhibits the gradual expression of MDR1 and BCL-2 at the mRNA level in K562 cells. Moreover, Western blot results confirm that in combination both of the drugs were capable of inducing apoptosis even if in a lower concentration compared to either single drug in both solution or in formulation.

There are numerous studies that diets containing an abundance of fruits and vegetables have protection against cancers, and the main agents thought to provide such protective effect are flavonoids. In this study we used apigetrin as a possible cell differentiation inducer and chronic leukemia cells K562 for their pluripotent differentiating potency. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prolonged treatment with 75 muM apigetrin induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells with specific marker glycophorin A expression and fetal hemoglobin synthesis in treated cells, which was accompanied with G(2) /M arrest. Proteomics data revealed the downregulation of several proteins expression involved in cell cycle regulation, protein synthesis and nuclear import and export of signaling molecules. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence that natural compound apigetrin may induce cancer cell differentiation thus could be one of the possible explanations of its antitumor effects.","['Tsolmon, Soninkhishig', 'Nakazaki, Eri', 'Han, Junkyu', 'Isoda, Hiroko']","['Tsolmon S', 'Nakazaki E', 'Han J', 'Isoda H']","['Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Mol Nutr Food Res,Molecular nutrition & food research,101231818,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2010/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mnfr.201000650 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Nutr Food Res. 2011 May;55 Suppl 1:S93-S102. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.201000650.

Medicinal and aromatic plants constitute a major source of natural organic compounds. In this study, essential oils of Artemisia absinthium L. and Echinops kebericho Mesfin were investigated by GC and GC/MS analyses. Isolated oils were screened for antileishmanial activity against two Leishmania strains (L. aethiopica and L. donovani), and toxicity on the human monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell line and red blood cells in vitro. GC/MS Analysis revealed 65 compounds (93.74%) for Artemisia absinthium and 43 compounds (92.85%) for Echinops kebericho oil. The oils contained the oxygenated monoterpene camphor (27.40%) and the sesquiterpene lactone dehydrocostus lactone (41.83%) as major constituents, respectively. Both oils showed activity against promastigote (MIC 0.0097-0.1565 mul/ml) and axenic amastigote forms (EC(50) 0.24-42.00 nl/ml) of both leishmania species. Weak hemolytic effect was observed for both oils, showing a slightly decreased selectivity index (SI 0.8-19.2) against the THP-1 cell line. Among the two oils tested, E. kebericho exerted strong antileishmanial activity that was even higher than that of amphotericin B with significant cytotoxicity. This study, therefore, demonstrated the potential use of both oils as source of novel agents for the treatment of leishmaniasis.","['Tariku, Yinebeb', 'Hymete, Ariaya', 'Hailu, Asrat', 'Rohloff, Jens']","['Tariku Y', 'Hymete A', 'Hailu A', 'Rohloff J']","['Department of Chemistry, College of Natural Science, Jimma University, P.O.

As results of study AML-BFM87 revealed an increased risk for relapse when CNS-RT was not performed, studies AML-BFM98 and -2004 randomized CNS-RT of 18 or 12 Gy in order to evaluate the efficacy of the lower dose and to reduce late effects. PROCEDURES: To achieve a power of 80% for non-inferiority (range 11%) 240 patients per group were required. Out of 722 eligible patients, 486 patients <18 years were randomized to receive 12 Gy (n = 249) or 18 Gy (n = 237). Since this was a non-inferiority study, the analysis was performed for patients as treated (12 Gy: n = 252 and 18 Gy: n = 219). RESULTS: Five-year survival, event-free survival and cumulative incidence of relapse were similar in patients who received 12 or 18 Gy, respectively (82 +/- 3% vs. 79 +/- 3%, 68 +/- 3% vs. 63 +/- 3%, and 30 +/- 3% vs. 34 +/- 3%). The lower limit of the one-sided confidence interval for the -5% difference in 5-years pEFS was 2%. There were six relapses with CNS involvement (one in the 12 Gy, and five in the 18 Gy group).

Allosteric activation of SFKs occurs through well-defined post-translational mechanisms, however the SFK member Fyn is over-expressed in multiple human cancers (prostate, melanoma, pancreatic, glioma, chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the mechanism of increased Fyn expression is unclear. Since activation of Ras oncogenes is a common oncogenic event leading to the activation of multiple effector pathways, we explored if Ras could induce Fyn expression. Retroviral transduction of the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT with oncogenic H-Ras dramatically up-regulated Fyn mRNA (>100-fold, P < 0.001), protein, and kinase activity without affecting Src levels or activity. Activation of Akt, but not MAPK or EGFR, was necessary and sufficient for induction of Fyn by H-Ras. Expression of active Fyn was sufficient to increase HaCaT cell migration and invasion, and the enhanced migration and invasion induced by H-Ras could be significantly blocked (70% reduction, P < 0.01) by knockdown of Fyn with a specific siRNA or inhibition of SFKs with PP2. In addition, expression of Fyn in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was dependent on PI3K activity and was involved in their invasive phenotype. Thus, the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway can account for Fyn over-expression in cancers, and Fyn is a critical mediator of the Ras-stimulated invasive cell phenotype. These results support the development of therapeutic strategies targeting Akt/Fyn pathway to block migration and invasion of tumor cells.","['Yadav, Vipin', 'Denning, Mitchell F']","['Yadav V', 'Denning MF']","['Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.20716 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2011 May;50(5):346-52. doi: 10.1002/mc.20716.

We identified by a genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library screen the genes zinc finger, MYM-type 2 (ZNF198) and suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (Drosophila) (SUZ12) whose protein depletion rescues pX-expressing cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis. ZNF198 and SUZ12 are components of chromatin remodeling complexes and associate with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Knockdown of ZNF198 and SUZ12 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced p53 stability and DNA repair, rescued pX-expressing hepatocytes from DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and increased pX-induced polyploidy and oncogenic transformation, suggesting ZNF198 and SUZ12 have a role in pX-mediated transformation. Interestingly, during pX-mediated transformation the protein but not messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12 progressively decreased, whereas Plk1 levels increased. Inhibition of Plk1 activity restored protein levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12. In addition, transfected Polo-box-domain (PBD) of Plk1 coimmunoprecipitated with ZNF198 and SUZ12, suggesting that these proteins are Plk1 substrates. Elevated Plk1 and reduced protein levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12 were also observed in human liver cancer cell lines derived from HBV-related tumors and in the presence of HBV replication. Importantly, knockdown by siRNA of ZNF198 and SUZ12 enhanced HBV replication. CONCLUSION: Reduced protein levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12 and elevated Plk1 occur during pX-mediated hepatocyte transformation in human liver cancer cell lines, as well as during HBV replication, underscoring the significance of these genes both in HBV-mediated HCC pathogenesis and HBV replication. We propose Plk1 activity down-regulates ZNF198 and SUZ12, thereby enhancing both HBV replication and pX-mediated oncogenic transformation.","['Wang, Wen-Horng', 'Studach, Leo L', 'Andrisani, Ourania M']","['Wang WH', 'Studach LL', 'Andrisani OM']","['Department of Basic Medical Sciences and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, West Lafayette, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.24163 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2011 Apr;53(4):1137-47. doi: 10.1002/hep.24163.,10.1002/hep.24163 [doi],,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (ZMYM2 protein, human)', '0 (hepatitis B virus X protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hepatitis B virus/*physiology', 'Hepatocytes/*virology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'Virus Replication']","['DK044533/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK044533-10/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK044533/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA135192-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK044533-12/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA135192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA135192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK044533-13/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA135192-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK044533-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3079326,['2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],,,['NIHMS262941'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk stratification is pivotal for ALL prognosis and individualized therapy. The current factors for risk stratification include clinical and laboratory features, cytogenetic characteristics of the blast, early response to chemotherapy, and genetic factors. Analyses of gene expression are becoming increasingly important in ALL risk stratification. beta-Arrestin1, a multifunctional scaffold protein mediating many intracellular signaling networks, has been shown to be involved in many tumors. However, little is known of beta-arrestin1 in leukemia. In this study, we found that beta-arrestin1 was significantly elevated in 155 newly diagnosed ALL patients, compared with 51 controls. Further analysis showed that beta-arrestin1 expression was positively related with risk classification and white blood cell count in ALL. Moreover, expression of Notch1, an essential gene for developing hematological cells and T-ALL, was found to be negatively correlated with beta-arrestin1 in ALL. In conclusion, beta-arrestin1 may be a useful predictor of risk stratification and prognosis of ALL, and thus of potential use in the design of individualized therapy strategies.","['Liu, Hui', 'Long, Juan', 'Zhang, Peng-Hui', 'Li, Kang', 'Tan, Jun-Jie', 'Sun, Bin', 'Yu, Jie', 'Tu, Zhi-Guang', 'Zou, Lin']","['Liu H', 'Long J', 'Zhang PH', 'Li K', 'Tan JJ', 'Sun B', 'Yu J', 'Tu ZG', 'Zou L']","[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Key Laboratory of Developmental Disease in the Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Key Laboratory of Developmental Disease in the Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China."", 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics in the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Key Laboratory of Developmental Disease in the Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Key Laboratory of Developmental Disease in the Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Key Laboratory of Developmental Disease in the Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics in the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Key Laboratory of Developmental Disease in the Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China. zoulin_74@yahoo.com.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/08/17 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0824-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0824-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Apr;93(4):494-501. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0824-9.

METHOD: External photon radiation has been measured through individual dosimeters. Potential exposure to internal contamination or to neutrons has been assessed by experts on the basis of quantitative measurements or of worksite and type of activity. The mortality observed in each population was compared with that expected from national mortality statistics, by computing standardized mortality ratios. Dose-effect relationships were analyzed through trend tests and log-linear Poisson regressions. RESULTS: 14,796 workers were exposed only to external photon radiation; 14,408 workers were also potentially exposed to internal radiation or to neutrons. Between 1968 and 1994, the number of deaths is respectively, 645 and 1,197. The mean external photon dose was respectively, 3.7 and 12.9 mSv. Similar Healthy Worker Effects were observed in the two populations (SMR = 0.59). SMR of 2.41 90% CI [1.39-3.90] was observed for malignant melanoma among workers of the second population. Significant dose-effect relationships were observed: among workers exposed only to external photon radiation for leukemia except CLL and in the other population, for cancers and other diseases related to tobacco or alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Results differed between the two populations. The increase in leukemia risk with dose in the first population will have to be confirmed with extended follow-up. In the other population, results may have been confounded by alpha-emitters inhalation, tobacco, or alcohol consumption.","['Samson, Eric', 'Telle-Lamberton, Maylis', 'Caer-Lorho, Sylvaine', 'Bard, Denis', 'Giraud, Jean-Michel', 'Metz-Flamant, Camille', 'Neron, Marie-Odile', 'Quesne, Benoit', 'Acker, Alain', 'Tirmarche, Margot', 'Hill, Catherine']","['Samson E', 'Telle-Lamberton M', 'Caer-Lorho S', 'Bard D', 'Giraud JM', 'Metz-Flamant C', 'Neron MO', 'Quesne B', 'Acker A', 'Tirmarche M', 'Hill C']","['DRPH, SRBE, LEPID, Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. eric.samson@irsn.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00420-011-0636-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2011 Aug;84(6):627-34. doi: 10.1007/s00420-011-0636-5.

We assessed the expression of SOX11, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 mRNA in 152 patients with B-cell lymphocytic proliferative diseases (B-LPD) using qRT-PCR and we detected SOX11 protein using immunohistochemistry in 15 B-LPD patients, to clarify the clinical significance of the four genes in B-LPD. Data showed the transcriptional levels of SOX11 and cyclin D1 were higher for the mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) samples compared with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), and healthy collators. The expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 were both higher in DLBCL than in SMZL. The expression levels of the four genes were highly related to each other. Three of 4 MCL patients showed nuclear staining for SOX11, while other 11 B-LPD examples were negative. Furthermore, we also found the ZAP70-positive CLL patients had higher SOX11 expression levels than ZAP70-negative CLL patients. It was revealed that MCL patients have higher expression levels of SOX11 and cyclin D1 mRNA, specially expressed nuclear SOX11 protein.","['Cao, Xin', 'Fan, Lei', 'Fang, Cheng', 'Zhu, Dan-Xia', 'Dong, Hua-Jie', 'Wang, Dong-Mei', 'Wang, Yin-Hua', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Cao X', 'Fan L', 'Fang C', 'Zhu DX', 'Dong HJ', 'Wang DM', 'Wang YH', 'Xu W', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029 Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,2011/04/12 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-9937-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Jun;29(2):1190-6. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-9937-5.

Cancer development and progression is modeled by simulating the stochastic evolution of initially healthy cells which can experience genetic mutations and modify their reproductive behavior, becoming leukemic clones. Front line therapy for the treatment of patients affected by CML is based on the administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, namely imatinib (Gleevec) or, more recently, dasatinib or nilotinib. Despite the fact that they represent the first example of a successful molecular targeted therapy, the development of resistance to these drugs is observed in a proportion of patients, especially those in advanced stages. In this study, we simulate an imatinib-like treatment of CML by modifying the fitness and the death rate of cancerous cells and describe the several scenarios in the evolutionary dynamics of white blood cells as a consequence of the efficacy of the different modeled therapies. The patient response to the therapy is investigated by simulating a drug administration following a continuous or pulsed time scheduling. A permanent disappearance of leukemic clones is achieved with a continuous therapy. This theoretical behavior is in a good agreement with that observed in previous clinical investigations. However, these findings demonstrate that an intermittent therapy could represent a valid alternative in patients with high risk of toxicity. A suitable tuned pulsed therapy can also reduce the probability of developing resistance.","['Pizzolato, Nicola', 'Persano Adorno, Dominique', 'Valenti, Davide', 'Spagnolo, Bernardo']","['Pizzolato N', 'Persano Adorno D', 'Valenti D', 'Spagnolo B']","['Dipartimento di Fisica, Group of Interdisciplinary Physics, Universita di Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, ed. 18, 90128, Palermo, Italy. npizzolato@gip.dft.unipa.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Theory Biosci,Theory in biosciences = Theorie in den Biowissenschaften,9708216,2011/04/12 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12064-011-0127-y [doi]'],ppublish,Theory Biosci. 2011 Sep;130(3):203-10. doi: 10.1007/s12064-011-0127-y.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from 71 patients treated with bendamustine/rituximab combination in Tyrol/Austria. Toxicities, therapeutic response, and survival outcome in the various lymphoma entities were analyzed. RESULTS: There was considerable hematotoxicity, with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of grade 3 or 4 in 33% and 18%, respectively. Interestingly, severe infection of grade 3 or 4 was observed in a remarkable percentage of patients with aggressive lymphoma and CLL (21% and 28%, respectively) but not in indolent lymphoma (p = 0.027). Overall, the therapeutic efficacy of bendamustine/rituximab was encouraging. In CLL, an overall response rate (ORR) of 65% was achieved. Notably, in the seven previously untreated CLL patients, ORR was 86%. The therapy was effective across all FISH-cytogenetic subgroups, except for the five patients harboring 17p deletion with unfavorable prognosis (PFS 2.7 months, OS 9.3 months). In indolent lymphoma (n = 25), the bendamustine-rituximab combination induced a remarkable therapeutic effect (ORR 96%, median PFS and OS not reached). In aggressive lymphoma (n = 20), ORR was 50%; in International Prognostic Index high-risk patients (4 or 5 risk factors, n = 10), ORR was only 20%, significantly inferior than in low/intermediate risk patients (ORR 70%; p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: In the routine setting aside clinical studies, bendamustine/rituximab therapy resulted in marked clinical responses, especially in CLL and indolent lymphoma. In aggressive lymphoma, the combination of bendamustine and rituximab was effective in favorable risk patients.","['Waldthaler, Christian', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Schnallinger, Michael', 'Schreieck, Stephan', 'Hager, Judith', 'Oexle, Horst', 'Zangerl, Gunther', 'Verdorfer, Irmgard', 'Zabernigg, August', 'Gastl, Gunther', 'Fiegl, Michael']","['Waldthaler C', 'Stauder R', 'Schnallinger M', 'Schreieck S', 'Hager J', 'Oexle H', 'Zangerl G', 'Verdorfer I', 'Zabernigg A', 'Gastl G', 'Fiegl M']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, Hematology & Oncology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.

The major classes of anti-HIV drugs include reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, and entry/fusion inhibitors. While antiretroviral drug regimens are not commonly used to treat other types of retroviral infections, there are instances where there is a perceived need for re-evaluation of the benefits of antiretroviral therapy. One case in point is that of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), an infection of companion felines. While vaccines exist to prevent FeLV infection and spread, they have not eliminated FeLV infection. For FeLV-infected felines and their human companions, antiretroviral therapy would be desirable and of practical importance if good options were available. Here, we discuss FeLV biology and current treatment options, and propose that there is a need for antiretroviral treatment options for FeLV infection. The comparative use and analysis of antiretroviral therapy can provide new insights into the mechanism of antiretroviral drug action.","['Greggs, Willie M 3rd', 'Clouser, Christine L', 'Patterson, Steven E', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Greggs WM 3rd', 'Clouser CL', 'Patterson SE', 'Mansky LM']",['Institute for Molecular Virology.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,101253281,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/04/12 06:01,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/TCRM.S17731 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2011;7:115-22. doi: 10.2147/TCRM.S17731.

There is a continuous search for novel conditioning regimens that will reduce SCT-related toxicity while retaining maximal antimalignancy effect. Treosulfan (L-threitol-1,4-bis-methanesulfonate; dihydroxybusulfan) was initially used in the treatment of certain solid tumors. Preclinical studies showed that it has a myeloablative effect on committed and non-committed stem cells. It has potent immunosuppressive characteristics, more prominent than its related chemotherapy agent BU, which makes it an attractive candidate for the use in conditioning regimens before allo-SCT. It is also associated with a favorable toxicity profile with little extramedullary toxicity. The combination of fludarabine and treosulfan was explored in several studies in patients not eligible for standard myeloablative conditioning, and data are rapidly emerging. This regimen is associated with consistent engraftment. A limited non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate in the range of 9-28% was observed. This rate is promising considering the patients selected and results from low rates of organ toxicity as well as acute and chronic GVHD. The regimen was also associated with low relapse rates of 5-30% depending on disease status at SCT. Together with low NRM rate, this resulted in favorable survival in the range of 40-80%. Promising results were seen in myelodysplastic syndrome (survival 36-70%) and leukemia in remission (60-70%). Randomized prospective studies will be needed to better define the role of treosulfan-based regimens in SCT.","['Danylesko, I', 'Shimoni, A', 'Nagler, A']","['Danylesko I', 'Shimoni A', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Laboratory of Molecular Immunobiology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,2011/04/12 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201188 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.88 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jan;47(1):5-14. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.88.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary medical-surgical pediatric intensive care unit at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, University of Michigan. PATIENTS: All patients with leukemia admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2008. INTERVENTIONS: None; chart review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical course was characterized by demographics, leukemia diagnosis, phase of therapy, leukocyte count on admission, presence of sepsis, steroid administration, intensity of care, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score on admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary outcome was survival to pediatric intensive care unit discharge. Among 68 single admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit with leukemia during the study period, 33 (48.5%) were admitted with sepsis. Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit for sepsis was associated with greater compromise of hemodynamic and renal function and use of stress dose steroids (p = .016), inotropic and/or vasopressor drugs (p = .01), and renal replacement therapy (p = .028) than nonsepsis admission. There was higher mortality among children with sepsis than other diagnoses (52% vs. 17%, p = .004). Also, mortality among children with sepsis was higher among those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (60% vs. 44%) compared with acute myelogenous leukemia. Administration of stress dose steroids was associated with higher mortality (50% vs. 17%, p = .005) and neutropenia. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and sepsis showed the greatest mortality and resource use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute leukemia and sepsis had a much higher mortality rate compared with previously described sepsis mortality rates for the general pediatric intensive care unit patient populations. Patients who received steroids had an increased mortality rate, but given the retrospective nature of this study, we maintain a position of equipoise with regard to this association. Variation in mortality and resource use by leukemia type suggests further research is needed to develop targeted intervention strategies to enhance patient outcomes.","['Singer, Kanakadurga', 'Subbaiah, Perla', 'Hutchinson, Raymond', 'Odetola, Folafoluwa', 'Shanley, Thomas P']","['Singer K', 'Subbaiah P', 'Hutchinson R', 'Odetola F', 'Shanley TP']","['Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. ksinger@umich.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,2011/04/12 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PCC.0b013e31821927f1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2011 Nov;12(6):649-54. doi: 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31821927f1.,10.1097/PCC.0b013e31821927f1 [doi],,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/*mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Michigan/epidemiology', 'Patient Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/*physiopathology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",,,,,['Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2011 Nov;12(6):680-1.

However, in vitro data indicates that there is no detectable difference in inhibition of signaling downstream of Bcr-Abl between the two agents, and that neither drug induces apoptosis of CML CD34 (+) cells. We use a computational model of hematopoiesis and CML combined with serial quantitative data of disease burden under imatinib and nilotinib therapy to explain this apparent disconnect between in vivo and in vitro responses. We show how a subtle difference in the differentiation rate of CML cells under therapy with either agent, with marginal impact onto the in vitro studies, translates into a significantly different reproductive fitness of treated cells in vivo, providing a sizeable difference, hence providing an explanation for the superior response observed with nilotinib.","['Lenaerts, Tom', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Traulsen, Arne', 'Pacheco, Jorge M', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Dingli, David']","['Lenaerts T', 'Castagnetti F', 'Traulsen A', 'Pacheco JM', 'Rosti G', 'Dingli D']","['Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['15518 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.10.15518 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 May 15;10(10):1540-4. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.10.15518.

Whether PLZF can mediate this effector conversion independently of agonist signaling has not been investigated. We demonstrated that transgenic (Tg) expression of PLZF under the CD4 promoter induced the innate effector program in two different MHC class II-restricted TCR-Tg Rag1(-/-) models examined. In CD4 thymocytes expressing a fixed Tg TCR beta-chain, the associated TCRalpha sequences in wild-type and PLZF-Tg mice overlapped extensively, further demonstrating that PLZF could induce the effector program in most CD4 T cells that would normally be selected as naive cells. In contrast, PLZF altered the negative selection of thymocytes expressing TCR beta-chains reactive against several retroviral superantigens. Thus, PLZF is remarkable in that it is a transcription factor capable of inducing an effector program in the absence of T cell agonist interactions or cell division. Its expression may also enhance the survival of agonist-signaled thymocytes.","['Savage, Adam K', 'Constantinides, Michael G', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Savage AK', 'Constantinides MG', 'Bendelac A']","['Committee on Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1100119 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1100119 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 May 15;186(10):5801-6. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100119.

In this article, we report that the thymic T-T interaction is essential for the conversion of CD8(+) T cells into innate phenotype in the physiological condition. CD8(+) T cells developed in the presence of PLZF(+) CD4(+) T cells showed marked upregulation of eomesodermin (Eomes), activation/memory phenotype, and rapid production of IFN-gamma on ex vivo stimulation. Their development was highly dependent on the PLZF expression in T-T CD4(+) T cells and the IL-4 secreted by PLZF(+) T-T CD4(+) T cells. The same events may take place in humans, as a substantial number of Eomes expressing innate CD8(+) T cells were found in human fetal thymi and spleens. It suggests that PLZF(+) T-T CD4(+) T cells in combination with Eomes(+) CD8(+) T cells might actively participate in the innate immune response against various pathogens, particularly in human perinatal period.","['Min, Hye Sook', 'Lee, You Jeong', 'Jeon, Yoon Kyung', 'Kim, Eun Ji', 'Kang, Byung Hyun', 'Jung, Kyeong Cheon', 'Chang, Cheong-Hee', 'Park, Seong Hoe']","['Min HS', 'Lee YJ', 'Jeon YK', 'Kim EJ', 'Kang BH', 'Jung KC', 'Chang CH', 'Park SH']","['Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 110-799 Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1002825 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1002825 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 May 15;186(10):5749-57. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1002825.

Tumour progression in CLL B cells seems to result in gradual accumulation of the clone of resting B lymphocytes in the early phases (G0/G1) of the cell cycle. The G1 phase is impaired in B-CLL. We investigated the gene expression of five key cell cycle regulators: TP 53, c-Myc, cyclin D2, p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1, which primarily regulate the G1 phase of the cell cycle, or S-phase entry and ultimately control the proliferation and cell growth as well as their role in B-CLL progression. The study was conducted in peripheral blood CLL lymphocytes of 40 previously untreated patients. Statistical analysis of correlations of TP53, cyclin D2, c-Myc, p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 expressions in B-CLL patients with different Rai stages demonstrated that the progression of disease was accompanied by increases in p53, cyclin D2 and c-Myc mRNA expression. The expression of p27KIP1 was nearly statistically significant whereas that of p21 WAF1/CIP1 showed no such correlation. Moreover, high expression levels of TP53 and c-Myc genes were found to be closely associated with more aggressive forms of the disease requiring earlier therapy.","['Halina, Antosz', 'Artur, Paterski', 'Barbara, Marzec-Kotarska', 'Joanna, Sajewicz', 'Anna, Dmoszynska']","['Halina A', 'Artur P', 'Barbara MK', 'Joanna S', 'Anna D']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland. hagenetyka@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/08/20 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['P7QH74147RPT4512 [pii]', '10.2478/v10042-010-0048-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2010 Dec;48(4):534-41. doi: 10.2478/v10042-010-0048-5.,10.2478/v10042-010-0048-5 [doi],,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cyclin D2/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Final results of 30105 demonstrated that induction carboplatin and gemcitabine and concurrent gemcitabine 3D-CRT was not feasible because of treatment-related toxicity. However, induction and concurrent carboplatin/paclitaxel with 74 Gy 3D-CRT had a median survival of 24 months, and is the basis for the experimental arm in CALGB 30610/RTOG 0617/N0628. We conducted a secondary analysis of all patients to determine predictors of treatment-related pulmonary toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient, tumor, and treatment-related variables were analyzed to determine their relation with treatment-related pulmonary toxicity. RESULTS: Older age, higher N stage, larger planning target volume (PTV)1, smaller total lung volume/PTV1 ratio, larger V20, and larger mean lung dose were associated with increasing pulmonary toxicity on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis confirmed that V20 and nodal stage as well as treatment with concurrent gemcitabine were associated with treatment-related toxicity. A high-risk group comprising patients with N3 disease and V20 >38% was associated with 80% of Grades 3-5 pulmonary toxicity cases. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated V20 and N3 disease status are important predictors of treatment related pulmonary toxicity in patients treated with high-dose 3D-CRT and concurrent chemotherapy. Further studies may use these metrics in considering patients for these treatments.","['Salama, Joseph K', 'Stinchcombe, Thomas E', 'Gu, Lin', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Morano, Karen', 'Bogart, Jeffrey A', 'Crawford, Jeffrey C', 'Socinski, Mark A', 'Blackstock, A William', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Salama JK', 'Stinchcombe TE', 'Gu L', 'Wang X', 'Morano K', 'Bogart JA', 'Crawford JC', 'Socinski MA', 'Blackstock AW', 'Vokes EE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Box 3085, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. joseph.salama@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,2011/04/12 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(11)00230-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.01.056 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Nov 15;81(4):e269-74. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.01.056.

Genome-wide protein localization and transcriptome analyses demonstrate overlapping gene regulatory functions between Oct4 and Wdr5. The Oct4-Sox2-Nanog circuitry and trxG cooperate in activating transcription of key self-renewal regulators, and furthermore, Wdr5 expression is required for the efficient formation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.

We have reported that chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-conditioned medium (CM) promoted the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into motor neurons. We investigated the formation of undifferentiated iPS cell colonies and the differentiation of iPS cells into neurons using DRG-CM. When iPS cells were cultured in DMEM containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), the iPS cells appeared to be maintained in an undifferentiated state for 19 passages. The number of iPS cell colonies (200 mum in diameter) was maximal at six days of cultivation and the colonies were maintained in an undifferentiated state, but the iPS cell colonies at ten days of cultivation had hollows inside the colonies and were differentiated. By contrast, the number of ES cell colonies (200 mum in diameter) was maximal at ten days of cultivation. The iPS cells were able to proliferate and differentiate easily into various cell lineages, compared to ES cells. When iPS cell colonies were cultured in a manner similar to ES cells with DMEM/F-12K medium supplemented with DRG-CM, the iPS cells mainly differentiated into motor and sensory neurons. These results suggested that the differentiation properties of iPS cells differ from those of ES cells.","['Kitazawa, Ayako', 'Shimizu, Norio']","['Kitazawa A', 'Shimizu N']","['Bio-Nano Electronics Research Center, Toyo University, 2100 Kujirai, Kawagoe-shi, Saitama 350-8585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,N Biotechnol,New biotechnology,101465345,2011/04/12 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1871-6784(11)00073-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nbt.2011.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,N Biotechnol. 2011 Jul;28(4):326-33. doi: 10.1016/j.nbt.2011.03.011.

The primary epoxidation products are four regioisomers of cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET): 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET. CYP2J2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 are the predominant epoxygenase isoforms involved in EET formation. CYP2J and CYP2C gene families in humans are abundantly expressed in the endothelium, myocardium, and kidney. The cardiovascular effects of CYP epoxygenases and EETs range from vasodilation, anti-hypertension, pro-angiogenesis, anti-atherosclerosis, and anti-inflammation to anti-injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion. Using transgenic animals for in vivo analyses of CYP epoxygenases revealed comprehensive and marked cardiovascular protective effects. In contrast, CYP epoxygenases and their metabolites, EETs, are upregulated in human tumors and promote tumor progression and metastasis. These biological effects result from the anti-apoptosis, pro-mitogenesis, and anti-migration roles of CYP epoxygenases and EETs at the cellular level. Importantly, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors are anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory and, therefore, protect the heart from damage, whereas the terfenadine-related, specific inhibitors of CYP2J2 exhibit strong anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, CYP2J2 and arachidonic acid-derived metabolites likely play important roles in regulating cardiovascular functions and malignancy under physiological and/or pathological conditions. Moreover, although challenges remain to improving the drug-like properties of sEH inhibitors and identifying efficient ways to deliver sEH inhibitors, sEH will likely become an important therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. In addition, CYP2J2 may be a therapeutic target for treating human cancers and leukemia.","['Xu, Xizhen', 'Zhang, Xin A', 'Wang, Dao Wen']","['Xu X', 'Zhang XA', 'Wang DW']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Institute of Hypertension, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Adv Drug Deliv Rev,Advanced drug delivery reviews,8710523,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2010/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0169-409X(11)00054-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.addr.2011.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2011 Jul 18;63(8):597-609. doi: 10.1016/j.addr.2011.03.006.

However, the actual molecular functions of these leukaemia-associated transcription factors on gene expression remained largely unknown until the recent discovery of their association with specific enzymatic activities that modify epigenetic codes (at DNA and/or histone levels) of downstream transcriptional targets. Intriguingly, while only just about half of acute leukaemia associates with recurring translocations, emerging evidence indicates that cryptic mutations identified in the ""normal-karyotype"" leukaemia also frequently affect components of epigenetic machinery.

This work was undertaken to evaluate if cancer cells can also express this receptor as a possible mechanisms of depletion of MIC molecules and thus interfere with their immune recognition. METHODS: Myelomonocytic leukemic (TPH-1 and U-937) and cervical cancer (CALO and INBL) cell lines were evaluated by Western Blot, ELISA, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry to evaluate their capacity to express and secrete MICA and MICB and to be induced to proliferate by these molecules as well as to express their receptor NKG2D. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA for time course analysis and Student's t-test for comparison between groups. Values were considered significantly different if p < 0.05. RESULTS: THP-1 and U-937 produce and secrete the stress MICA and MICB as shown by Western Blot of lysed cells and by ELISA of their conditioned media. By Western Blot and flow cytometry we found that these cells also express the receptor NKG2D. When THP-1 and U-937 were cultured with recombinant MICA and MICB they exhibited a dose dependent induction for their proliferation. CALO and INBL also produce MICA and MICB and were induced to proliferate by these stress molecules. By Western Blot, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry we also found that these cells express NKG2D. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel results that tumor cells can simultaneously secrete MIC molecules and express their receptor, and to be induced for proliferation by these stress molecules, and that tumor epithelial cells can also express the NKG2D receptor that was thought to be exclusive of NK and cytotoxic lymphocytes is discussed as a possible mechanism of immunological escape and of tumor growth induction.","['Weiss-Steider, Benny', 'Soto-Cruz, Isabel', 'Martinez-Campos, Christian A', 'Mendoza-Rincon, Jorge Flavio']","['Weiss-Steider B', 'Soto-Cruz I', 'Martinez-Campos CA', 'Mendoza-Rincon JF']","['Laboratorio de Oncologia Molecular, Unidad de Diferenciacion Celular y Cancer, FES-Zaragoza, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico 09230, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-30-37 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-30-37 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 10;30:37. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-30-37.,10.1186/1756-9966-30-37 [doi],20110410,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (MICB antigen)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/isolation & purification/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",,PMC3082231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed leukemia not in remission at allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) performed at our institution between January 1999 and July 2009. Forty-two patients with a median age of 39 years received intensified conditioning (n = 9), standard (n = 12) or reduced-intensity conditioning (n = 21) for allo-HCT. Fourteen patients received individual chemotherapy for cytoreduction during the three weeks prior to reduced-intensity conditioning. Diagnoses comprised acute leukemia (n = 29), chronic myeloid leukemia-accelerated phase (n = 2), myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) (n = 10) and plasma cell leukemia (n = 1). In those with acute leukemia, cytogenetic abnormalities were intermediate (44%) or poor (56%). The median number of blast cells in bone marrow (BM) was 26.0% (range; 0.2-100) before the start of chemotherapy for allo-HCT. Six patients had leukemic involvement of the central nervous system. Stem cell sources were related BM (7%), related peripheral blood (31%), unrelated BM (48%) and unrelated cord blood (CB) (14%). RESULTS: Engraftment was achieved in 33 (79%) of 42 patients. Median time to engraftment was 17 days (range: 9-32). At five years, the cumulative probabilities of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were 63% and 37%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 85 months for surviving patients, the five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of leukemia-free survival rate and overall survival (OS) were 17% and 19%, respectively. At five years, the cumulative probability of non-relapse mortality was 38%. In the univariable analyses of the influence of pre-transplant variables on OS, poor-risk cytogenetics, number of BM blasts (>26%), MDS overt AML and CB as stem cell source were significantly associated with worse prognosis (p = .03, p = .01, p = .02 and p < .001, respectively). In addition, based on a landmark analysis at 6 months post-transplant, the five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS in patients with and without prior history of chronic GVHD were 64% and 17% (p = .022), respectively. CONCLUSION: Graft-versus-leukemia effects possibly mediated by chronic GVHD may have played a crucial role in long-term survival in, or cure of active leukemia.","['Koh, Hideo', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Hagihara, Kiyoyuki', 'Nakane, Takahiko', 'Manabe, Masahiro', 'Hayashi, Yoshiki', 'Nishimoto, Mitsutaka', 'Umemoto, Yukari', 'Nakamae, Mika', 'Hirose, Asao', 'Inoue, Eri', 'Inoue, Atsushi', 'Yoshida, Masahiro', 'Bingo, Masato', 'Okamura, Hiroshi', 'Aimoto, Ran', 'Aimoto, Mizuki', 'Terada, Yoshiki', 'Koh, Ki-Ryang', 'Yamane, Takahisa', 'Ohsawa, Masahiko', 'Hino, Masayuki']","['Koh H', 'Nakamae H', 'Hagihara K', 'Nakane T', 'Manabe M', 'Hayashi Y', 'Nishimoto M', 'Umemoto Y', 'Nakamae M', 'Hirose A', 'Inoue E', 'Inoue A', 'Yoshida M', 'Bingo M', 'Okamura H', 'Aimoto R', 'Aimoto M', 'Terada Y', 'Koh KR', 'Yamane T', 'Ohsawa M', 'Hino M']","['Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-30-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-30-36 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 10;30:36. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-30-36.,10.1186/1756-9966-30-36 [doi],20110410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,PMC3083370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the interaction of these nanocomposites with cells is of vital importance in understanding their behaviour and biocompatibility. Here we report the preparation, characterisation and potential application of new ""two-in-one"" magnetic fluorescent nanocomposites composed of silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles covalently linked to a porphyrin moiety. METHOD: The experiments were performed by administering porphyrin functionalised silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles to THP-1 cells, a human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 25 mM HEPES supplemented with heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS). RESULTS: We have synthesised, characterised and analysed in vitro, a new multimodal (magnetic and fluorescent) porphyrin magnetic nanoparticle composite (PMNC). Initial co-incubation experiments performed with THP-1 macrophage cells were promising; however the PMNC photobleached under confocal microscopy study. beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME) was employed to counteract this problem and resulted not only in enhanced fluorescence emission, but also allowed for elongated imaging and increased exposure times of the PMNC in a cellular environment. CONCLUSION: Our experiments have demonstrated that beta-ME visibly enhances the emission intensity. No deleterious effects to the cells were witnessed upon co-incubation with beta-ME alone and no increases in background fluorescence were recorded. These results should present an interest for further development of in vitro biological imaging techniques.","['Nowostawska, Malgorzata', 'Corr, Serena A', 'Byrne, Stephen J', 'Conroy, Jennifer', 'Volkov, Yuri', ""Gun'ko, Yurii K""]","['Nowostawska M', 'Corr SA', 'Byrne SJ', 'Conroy J', 'Volkov Y', ""Gun'ko YK""]","['School of Chemistry, Trinity College Dublin, College Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Nanobiotechnology,Journal of nanobiotechnology,101152208,2011/04/12 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2009/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-3155-9-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-3155-9-13 [doi]']",epublish,J Nanobiotechnology. 2011 Apr 8;9:13. doi: 10.1186/1477-3155-9-13.,10.1186/1477-3155-9-13 [doi],20110408,"['0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '0 (Nanoconjugates)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', 'RWW266YE9I (HEPES)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diagnostic Imaging/methods', 'HEPES/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Mercaptoethanol/administration & dosage', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods', 'Nanoconjugates/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Photobleaching', 'Porphyrins/*chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",,PMC3090322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Portable computed tomography (CT) offers a versatile potential alternative when immediate imaging may alter the surgical plan and magnetic resonance imaging is not practical. METHODS: The medical records from the University or New Mexico were reviewed for portable head CT scans done in the operating room since the scanner has been available. Operative reports and imaging studies were reviewed to determine changes in surgical decision after the CT scan. FINDINGS: The portable head CT scanner was used in 50 cases from May 2007 through March 2010. Average operative time overall was 121 minutes and for reservoir placement was 54 minutes. Procedures included reservoir placement (28%), tumor resection (24%), cerebrospinal fluid shunting (24%), vascular lesion resection (8%), trauma craniotomy (6%), abscess drainage (4%), stereotactic biopsy (4%), and open reduction internal fixation of facial fractures (2%). Findings on the CT scan lead to alterations in the surgical plan 16 times (32%). CONCLUSION: In select cases, intraoperative portable head CT leads to changes in the surgical plan in 32% of cases.

Our previous studies have classified gnidilatimonoein, isolated from Daphne mucronata, as an IMPDH inhibitor and a strong antiproliferative agent among several types of leukaemia cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of gnidilatimonoein on intracellular GTP pool size and its link to differentiation and apoptosis of K562 cells. It was found that gnidilatimonoein inhibited cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in K562 cells after 24 h exposure to a single dose of gnidilatimonoein (1.5 muM), while no significant effects were observed on unstimulated and phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cells at the gnidilatimonoein dose (1.5 muM) used. Based on the morphological changes, Wright-Giemsa staining, benzidine assay and the expression of cell surface markers [GPIIb (glycoprotein IIb) and glycophorin A], as analysed by flow cytometry, we found that K562 cells had differentiated towards megakaryocytic lineage. In addition, gnidilatimonoein induced apoptosis among K562 cells based on Acridine Orange/ethidium bromide and annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining observations. These changes, which were abrogated by the addition of guanosine, became evident when the intracellular GTP level decreased to approx. 20-35% of the untreated control level. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that gnidilatimonoein induces differentiation and apoptosis in K562 cells through perturbation of GTP metabolism, as one of its routes of action.","['Nouri, Kazem', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh', 'Sarafnejad, Abdolfattah']","['Nouri K', 'Yazdanparast R', 'Sarafnejad A']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,2011/04/12 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['CBI20100728 [pii]', '10.1042/CBI20100728 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2011 Oct;35(10):1001-8. doi: 10.1042/CBI20100728.,10.1042/CBI20100728 [doi],,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (gnidilatimonoein)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Daphne/chemistry', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/toxicity', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Guanosine/*pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, in the present study, the effects of chemotherapy combined with mild hyperthermia at 41 degrees C (which is easier to apply than standard hyperthermia) were examined in the NALM-6 leukemia cell line. The results were as follows: i) NALM-6 leukemia cells, like most cells, survived mild hyperthermia at 41 degrees C, but were killed at temperatures over 43 degrees C. ii) Low concentrations of adriamycin (0.1 microg/ml) or mild hyperthermia applied separately did not have a visible effect on the survival rate of NALM-6 cells, whereas combined treatment with these therapies decreased the survival rate of NALM-6 cells in a time-dependent manner. The anti-tumor effect after 5 h of the combination of 0.1 microg/ml adriamycin and mild hyperthermia was the same as that observed with a 10-fold higher concentration (1 microg/ml) of adriamycin alone. iii) Another anti-tumor drug, vincristine, exhibited the same behavior as adriamycin. The anti-tumor effect after 1 h of the combination of 5x10-11 M vincristine and mild hyperthermia was the same as that observed with a 10-fold higher concentration (5x10-10 M) of vincristine alone. The results indicate that it may be possible to reduce the required concentrations of anti-tumor drugs by using them in combination with mild hyperthermia. In this way, the side effects of chemotherapy may be reduced in clinical settings. Mild hyperthermia is a useful and practical heating method, and could result in the increasing clinical application of hyperthermia in the treatment of cancer.","['Itoh, Youko', 'Kazaoka, Yoshiaki', 'Nitta, Masakazu', 'Yamada, Yoshiaki', 'Honda, Nobuaki']","['Itoh Y', 'Kazaoka Y', 'Nitta M', 'Yamada Y', 'Honda N']","['Radioisotope Research Center, Aichi Medical University, Aichi 480-1195, Japan. itoh@aichi-med-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,2009/05/01 00:00,2009/05/01 00:01,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr_00000114 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2009 May-Jun;2(3):411-5. doi: 10.3892/mmr_00000114.,10.3892/mmr_00000114 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A link between SV40 and NHL is biologically plausible because SV40 causes hematological malignancies in laboratory rodents. METHODS: We investigated 266 Egyptian cases of different hematological malignancies, for the presence of SV40 DNA using multiplex nested PCR technique. These cases consisted of 158 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 54 Hodgkin's disease(HD), 26 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 13 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 8 chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), 7 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in addition to 34 subjects of control group. RESULTS: Our results have shown that SV40 DNA sequences were found in 53.8% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, 29.6% of Hodgkin's disease patients, and 40.7% of different types of leukemia cases. Frequency of SV40 DNA sequences was higher in NHL patients compared to the other tumor cases. Also, frequency of SV40 DNA sequences was significantly higher (p<0.05) in NHL patients than in the control group. Regarding the different histological types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, SV40 DNA sequences were detected frequently in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in follicular lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that SV40 DNA virus is significantly associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and might have a role in the development of these hematological malignancies. Polyomavirus SV40 may act as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of these tumors and this could lead to new diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approaches.","['Mohamed, Waleed S', 'Samra, Mohamed A', 'Fawzy, Mohamed A']","['Mohamed WS', 'Samra MA', 'Fawzy MA']","['Virology and Immunology Unit, Cancer Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Fom El-Khalig, Cairo 11796, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Int J Health Sci (Qassim),International journal of health sciences,101528042,2007/01/01 00:00,2007/01/01 00:01,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Health Sci (Qassim). 2007 Jan;1(1):11-6.,,,,,,,PMC3068659,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental works of the past decade have highlighted the importance of calcium (Ca(2+)) in the regulation of apoptosis. Several studies indicate that the Ca(2+) content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) determines the cell's sensitivity to apoptotic stress and perturbation of ER Ca(2+) homeostasis appears to be a key component in the development of several pathological situations. Sensitivity to apoptosis depends on the ability of cells to transfer Ca(2+) from the ER to the mitochondria. The physical platform for the interplay between the ER and mitochondria is a domain of the ER called the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). The disruption of these contact sites has profound consequences for cellular function, such as imbalances of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling, cellular stress, and disrupted apoptosis progression. The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been previously recognized as a critical and essential regulator of multiple apoptotic response. Nevertheless, how PML would exert such broad and fundamental role in apoptosis remained for long time a mystery. In this review, we will discuss how recent results demonstrate that the elusive mechanism whereby the PML tumor suppressor exerts its essential role in apoptosis triggered by Ca(2+)-dependent stimuli can be attributed to its unexpected and fundamental role at MAMs in the control of the functional cross-talk between ER and mitochondria.","['Pinton, P', 'Giorgi, C', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Pinton P', 'Giorgi C', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Experimental and Diagnostic Medicine, Section of General Pathology, Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Inflammation, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201131 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2011.31 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2011 Sep;18(9):1450-6. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2011.31.

We demonstrate herein that IL-6 and TNF family cytokines, TNFalpha, BAFF and APRIL, but not IGF-1 cooperatively enhance the expression of the serine/threonine kinase Pim-2 in MM cells. BMSCs and OCs upregulate Pim-2 expression in MM cells largely via the IL-6/STAT3 and NF-kappaB pathway, respectively. Pim-2 short interfering RNA reduces MM cell viability in cocultures with BMSCs or OCs. Thus, upregulation of Pim-2 appears to be a novel anti-apoptotic mechanism for MM cell survival. Interestingly, the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin further suppresses the MM cell viability in combination with the Pim-2 silencing. The Pim inhibitor (Z)-5-(4-propoxybenzylidene) thiazolidine-2, 4-dione and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 cooperatively enhance MM cell death. The Pim inhibitor suppresses 4E-BP1 phosphorylation along with the reduction of Mcl-1 and c-Myc. Pim-2 may therefore become a new target for MM treatment.","['Asano, J', 'Nakano, A', 'Oda, A', 'Amou, H', 'Hiasa, M', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Miki, H', 'Nakamura, S', 'Harada, T', 'Fujii, S', 'Kagawa, K', 'Endo, I', 'Yata, K', 'Sakai, A', 'Ozaki, S', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Abe, M']","['Asano J', 'Nakano A', 'Oda A', 'Amou H', 'Hiasa M', 'Takeuchi K', 'Miki H', 'Nakamura S', 'Harada T', 'Fujii S', 'Kagawa K', 'Endo I', 'Yata K', 'Sakai A', 'Ozaki S', 'Matsumoto T', 'Abe M']","['Department of Medicine and Bioregulatory Sciences, University of Tokushima Graduate School of Medicine, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201160 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.60 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jul;25(7):1182-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.60.

Low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) is superior to best supportive care but is still inadequate. The combination of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and LDAC showed promise in an unrandomised study. We report a randomised trial of LDAC versus LDAC+ATO. Patients with AML according to WHO criteria or myelodysplastic syndrome with >10% blasts, considered as unfit for conventional chemotherapy, were randomised between subcutaneous Ara-C (20 mg b.d. for 10 days) and the same LDAC schedule with ATO (0.25 mg/kg) on days 1-5, 9 and 11, for at least four courses every 4 to 6 weeks. Overall 166 patients were entered; the trial was terminated on the advice of the DMC, as the projected benefit was not observed. Overall 14% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 7% CRi. Median survival was 5.5 months and 19 months for responders (CR: not reached; CRi: 14 months; non-responders: 4 months). There were no differences in response or survival between the arms. Grade 3/4 cardiac and liver toxicity, and supportive care requirements were greater in the ATO arm.

During our routine bone marrow trephine analysis of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) before and after treatment, we observed the presence of TdT-positive cells lacking CD34, CD10 and B cell antigens. METHODS: To verify the nature of these TdT-positive cells, we analyzed 140 paraffin-embedded and decalcified trephines from 67 AML patients before and after therapy using double immunolabellings. RESULTS: In 61% of the cases TdT-positive cells were present. After exclusion of neoplastic cells and haematogones, we identified that 16% of the cases harboured cells co-expressing myeloperoxidase and TdT, 15% glycophorin C and TdT, 13% CD117 and TdT and one case CD3 and TdT. These cells made up to 30% of the non-neoplastic TdT-positive cells. No differences in the number of TdT-positive cells before and after chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation could be observed. CONCLUSION: While the reason of TdT expression by non-neoplastic myeloid cells is unknown, their presence should be taken into account when evaluating such cases.","['Johrens, Korinna', 'Franke, Aylin', 'Dietel, Manfred', 'Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis']","['Johrens K', 'Franke A', 'Dietel M', 'Anagnostopoulos I']","['Institute of Pathology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Mitte, Berlin, Germany. korinna.joehrens@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['000322974 [pii]', '10.1159/000322974 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2011;78(1):35-40. doi: 10.1159/000322974.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether Pim-1 represents a novel mechanistic target for the cure of diabetic cardiomyopathy, a steadily increasing cause of nonischemic heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: In streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice, Pim-1 protein levels declined during progression of cardiomyopathy, along with upregulation of Pim-1 inhibitors, protein phosphatase 2A, and microRNA-1. Moreover, diabetic hearts showed low levels of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein and increased proapoptotic caspase-3 activity. Studies on adult rat cardiomyocytes and murine cardiac progenitor cells challenged with high glucose confirmed the in vivo expressional changes. In rescue studies, anti-microRNA-1 boosted Pim-1 and Bcl-2 expression and promoted cardiomyocyte and cardiac progenitor cell survival under high glucose conditions. Similarly, transfection with Pim-1 plasmid prevented high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte and cardiac progenitor cell apoptosis. Finally, a single intravenous injection of human PIM-1 via cardiotropic serotype-9 adeno-associated virus (1 x 10(10) or 5 x 10(10) plaque-forming units per animal) at 4 weeks after diabetes induction led to sustained cardiac overexpression of Pim-1 and improved diastolic function and prevented left ventricular dilation and failure. Histological examination showed reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis in association with increased c-kit(+) cells and cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas molecular analysis confirmed activation of the prosurvival pathway and conservation of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and alpha-myosin heavy chain in Pim-1-treated hearts. CONCLUSIONS: Pim-1 downregulation contributes in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Systemic delivery of human PIM-1 via cardiotropic adeno-associated virus serotype-9 represents a novel and effective approach to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy.","['Katare, Rajesh', 'Caporali, Andrea', 'Zentilin, Lorena', 'Avolio, Elisa', 'Sala-Newby, Graciela', 'Oikawa, Atsuhiko', 'Cesselli, Daniela', 'Beltrami, Antonio Paolo', 'Giacca, Mauro', 'Emanueli, Costanza', 'Madeddu, Paolo']","['Katare R', 'Caporali A', 'Zentilin L', 'Avolio E', 'Sala-Newby G', 'Oikawa A', 'Cesselli D', 'Beltrami AP', 'Giacca M', 'Emanueli C', 'Madeddu P']","['Department of Experimental Cardiovascular Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['CIRCRESAHA.110.239111 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.239111 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2011 May 13;108(10):1238-51. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.239111.

Five-year and 10-year event-free survival (EFS) was 80.2% +/- 2.8% and 78.1% +/- 4.3% for HDM (n = 219) versus 73.6% +/- 3.1% and 72.6% +/- 5.0% for no HDM (n = 217; P = .17). For T-ALL, 5-year and 10-year EFS was significantly better with HDM (n = 148, 5 years: 79.5% +/- 3.4%, 10 years: 77.3% +/- 5.3%) versus no HDM (n = 151, 5 years: 67.5% +/- 3.9%, 10 years: 66.0% +/- 6.6%; P = .047). The difference in EFS between HDM and no HDM was not significant for T-NHL patients (n = 71, 5 years: 81.7% +/- 4.9%, 10 years: 79.9% +/- 7.5% vs n = 66, 5 years: 87.8% +/- 4.2%, 10 years: 87.8% +/- 6.4%; P = .38). The frequency of mucositis was significantly higher in patients treated with HDM (P = .003). The results support adding HDM to the treatment of children with T-ALL, but not with NHL, despite the increased risk of mucositis.","['Asselin, Barbara L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Wang, Chenguang', 'Pullen, Jeanette', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Hutchison, Robert', 'Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Camitta, Bruce M']","['Asselin BL', 'Devidas M', 'Wang C', 'Pullen J', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Hutchison R', 'Lipshultz SE', 'Camitta BM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA. barbara_asselin@urmcrochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44676-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-292615 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 28;118(4):874-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-292615.

We recently showed that Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited apoptosis in leukemia cells by creating a pro-oxidant intracellular milieu, and that inhibiting intracellular superoxide production sensitized Bcl-2-overexpressing cells to apoptotic stimuli. We report here that silencing and functional inhibition of Rac1 block Bcl-2-mediated increase in intracellular superoxide levels in tumor cells. Using confocal, electron microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation, as well as glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins, we provide evidence for a colocalization and physical interaction between the 2 proteins. This interaction is blocked in vitro and in vivo by the BH3 mimetics as well as by synthetic Bcl-2 BH3 domain peptides. That this interaction is functionally relevant is supported by the ability of the Bcl-2 BH3 peptide as well as the silencing and functional inhibition of Rac1 to inhibit intracellular superoxide production as well as overcome Bcl-2-mediated drug resistance in human leukemia cells and cervical cancer cells. Notably, the interaction was observed in primary cells derived from patients with B-cell lymphoma overexpressing Bcl-2 but not in noncancerous tissue. These data provide a novel facet in the biology of Bcl-2 with potential implications for targeted anticancer drug design.","['Velaithan, Rathiga', 'Kang, Jia', 'Hirpara, Jayshree L', 'Loh, Thomas', 'Goh, Boon Cher', 'Le Bras, Morgane', 'Brenner, Catherine', 'Clement, Marie-Veronique', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Velaithan R', 'Kang J', 'Hirpara JL', 'Loh T', 'Goh BC', 'Le Bras M', 'Brenner C', 'Clement MV', 'Pervaiz S']","['Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44964-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-301283 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 9;117(23):6214-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-301283.

We report here 4 cases of ABL with a t(X;6)(p11;q23) translocation occurring in male infants. Because of its location on chromosome 6q23, MYB was a good candidate gene. Our molecular investigations, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, revealed that the translocation generated a MYB-GATA1 fusion gene.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bcr/Abl(+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, including those resistant to IM (T315I, E255K), were exposed to KW-2449 in the presence or absence of vorinostat or SNDX-275, after which apoptosis and effects on signaling pathways were examined. In vivo studies combining HDACIs and KW2449 were carried out by using a systemic IM-resistant ALL xenograft model. RESULTS: Coadministration of HDACIs synergistically increased KW-2449 lethality in vitro in multiple CML and Ph(+) ALL cell types including human IM resistant cells (e.g., BV-173/E255K and Adult/T315I). Combined treatment resulted in inactivation of Bcr/Abl and downstream targets (e.g., STAT5 and CRKL), as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage (gammaH2A.X). The latter events and cell death were significantly attenuated by free radical scavengers (TBAP). Increased lethality was also observed in primary CD34(+) cells from patients with CML, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Finally, minimally active vorinostat or SNDX275 doses markedly increased KW2449 antitumor effects and significantly prolonged the survival of murine xenografts bearing IM-resistant ALL cells (BV173/E255K). CONCLUSIONS: HDACIs increase KW-2449 lethality in Bcr/Abl(+) cells in association with inhibition of Bcr/Abl, generation of ROS, and induction of DNA damage. This strategy preferentially targets primary Bcr/Abl(+) hematopoietic cells and exhibits enhanced in vivo activity. Combining KW-2449 with HDACIs warrants attention in IM-resistant Bcr/Abl(+) leukemias.","['Nguyen, Tri', 'Dai, Yun', 'Attkisson, Elisa', 'Kramer, Lora', 'Jordan, Nicholas', 'Nguyen, Nguyen', 'Kolluri, Nikhil', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Grant, Steven']","['Nguyen T', 'Dai Y', 'Attkisson E', 'Kramer L', 'Jordan N', 'Nguyen N', 'Kolluri N', 'Muschen M', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Biochemistry, and Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University Health Sciences Center, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/10/08 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0234 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0234 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 May 15;17(10):3219-32. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0234.

A study was undertaken to attempt to improve the outcome for such patients using a high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) based strategy. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2007, 40 patients with relapsed medulloblastoma (MB) and 5 with relapsed supratentorial PNETs (StPNETs) were accrued. All but one had received prior craniospinal radiotherapy. Patients were initially treated with cyclophosphamide (4 g/m(2)) together with surgery or local radiotherapy where appropriate. If complete or near complete remission was achieved, the patient proceeded to receive two sequential courses of HDCT with stem cell rescue. The first course consisted of thiotepa (900 mg/m(2)) and the second carboplatin (AUC 21). RESULTS: All five patients with StPNET died of tumour progression with a median OS of 0.4 years. Nineteen of the 40 patients with relapsed MB underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was administered to eight patients. All patients received at least one course of cyclophosphamide. Only 22 MB patients progressed to the HDCT phase; 10 patients received thiotepa only and 12 thiotepa and carboplatin. At a median follow-up of 7.4 years (Range 2.8-8.2 years), only three MB patients are still alive, one following a further relapse. Three and 5 year OS was 22.0% and 8.2%, respectively and 3 and 5 year EFS was 14.6% and 8.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This national study based on a strategy including a particular tandem HDCT regimen showed no benefit for previously irradiated patients with relapsed StPNET and very limited benefit for patients with relapsed medulloblastoma.","['Pizer, Barry', 'Donachie, Paul H J', 'Robinson, Kathryn', 'Taylor, Roger E', 'Michalski, Antony', 'Punt, Jonathan', 'Ellison, David W', 'Picton, Susan']","['Pizer B', 'Donachie PH', 'Robinson K', 'Taylor RE', 'Michalski A', 'Punt J', 'Ellison DW', 'Picton S']","[""Oncology Unit, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Eaton Road, Liverpool L12 2AP, United Kingdom. barry.pizer@alderhey.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00149-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 Jun;47(9):1389-97. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.004.

Insights into the characteristics of such antibodies may allow for analyses of the molecular basis underlying allergenicity and cross-reactivity, standardisation of allergens as well as improvement of allergy diagnostics and therapeutics. Here we report the generation and application of the first set of authentic human IgG, IgE and IgA antibodies. On the basis of a Phl p 5a specific antibody fragment, a lambda light chain and the IgG1, IgG4, IgE, IgA1, and IgA2 heavy chains, the corresponding human immunoglobulins were constructed and produced in mammalian cells. In parallel, a murine hybridoma line with specificity for Phl p 5a was established, recloned and produced as human chimeric IgE. After purification, immunoreactivity of the antibodies with the allergen was assessed. Applicability in allergy diagnostics was confirmed by establishment of artificial human sera. Functionality of both antibodies was further demonstrated in receptor binding studies and mediator release assays using humanised rat basophil leukaemia cells (RBL-SX38) suggesting the presence of spatially separate epitopes. By using Phl p 5 fusion proteins and recombinant IgE in immunoblotting and mediator release assays we assigned the epitope of the authentic IgE to a looped stretch exclusively present in Phl p 5a.

Investigation of this rare mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) cytogenetic abnormality aims to provide further evidence of the genetic changes that underpin this aggressive form of leukemia in infants. METHOD: The clinical features of a monozygotic infant twin pair with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are reported. Banded chromosomal analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization were used for cytogenetic characterization of the leukemic cells. Immunophenotype was determined by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of FLT3-D835/I836 and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. RESULTS: The twins were seven weeks of age at diagnosis. Both had cytogenetic evidence for the t(1;11)(p32;q23) translocation. Trisomy X was present in a subpopulation of cells in one twin. Immunophenotypic profile at diagnosis was consistent with B precursor ALL (CD19, CD24, CD33 positive, weak CD13 positivity, CD10 negative) and both were negative for FLT3-D835/I836 and FLT3-ITD mutations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of monochorionic monozygotic twins harboring the t(1;11)(p32;q23) translocation.

Transcriptional intermediary factor 1gamma (TIF1gamma) regulates vertebrate hematopoietic development, can control transcription elongation, and is a component of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Here we show that deletion of TIF1gamma in adult hematopoiesis is compatible with life and long-term maintenance of essential blood cell lineages. However, loss of TIF1gamma results in deficient long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) transplantation activity, deficient short-term HSC (ST-HSC) bone marrow retention, and priming ST-HSCs to myelomonocytic lineage. These defects are hematopoietic cell-autonomous, and priming of TIF1gamma-deficient ST-HSCs can be partially rescued by wild-type hematopoietic cells. TIF1gamma can form complexes with TAL1 or PU.1-two essential DNA-binding proteins in hematopoiesis-occupy specific subsets of their DNA binding sites in vivo, and repress their transcriptional activity. These results suggest a regulation of adult hematopoiesis through TIF1gamma-mediated transcriptional repression of TAL1 and PU.1 target genes.","['Kusy, Sophie', 'Gault, Nathalie', 'Ferri, Federica', 'Lewandowski, Daniel', 'Barroca, Vilma', 'Jaracz-Ros, Agnieszka', 'Losson, Regine', 'Romeo, Paul-Henri']","['Kusy S', 'Gault N', 'Ferri F', 'Lewandowski D', 'Barroca V', 'Jaracz-Ros A', 'Losson R', 'Romeo PH']","[""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, DSV/iRCM/LRTS, 92265 Fontenay-aux-Roses cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/07/30 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(11)00056-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2011 Apr 8;8(4):412-25. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.005.,10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.005 [doi],,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TRIM33 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) was recently shown to regulate the tumorigenic capacity of glioma stem cells under hypoxic conditions. Surprisingly, we found that, under normoxia, HIF1alpha signaling was selectively activated in the stem cells of mouse lymphoma and human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HIF1a shRNA and HIF inhibitors abrogated the colony-forming unit (cfu) activity of mouse lymphoma and human AML CSCs. Importantly, the HIF-inhibitor echinomycin efficiently eradicated mouse lymphoma and serially transplantable human AML in xenogeneic models by preferential elimination of CSCs. Hif1alpha maintains mouse lymphoma CSCs by repressing a negative feedback loop in the Notch pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate an essential function of Hif1alpha-Notch interaction in maintaining CSCs and provide an effective approach to target CSCs for therapy of hematological malignancies.","['Wang, Yin', 'Liu, Yan', 'Malek, Sami N', 'Zheng, Pan', 'Liu, Yang']","['Wang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Malek SN', 'Zheng P', 'Liu Y']","['Division of Immunotherapy, Section of General Surgery, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/07/30 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(11)00057-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2011 Apr 8;8(4):399-411. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.006.,10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.006 [doi],,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphoma', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']","['R01 CA058033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI064350/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG036690/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI064350-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058033-16A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 GM091648/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG036690-02/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 GM091648-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG036690-01A1/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3084595,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The present study evaluated the apoptotic effect of 2alpha,3alpha-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (DHURS), purified from the dried spikes on human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) loss, apoptotic change of the cell cycle, and apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometric analysis. Mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspase cascade were determined by Western blot analysis. Caspase-12 activity and caspase-3 activity were assayed using the Fluorometric Assay Kit and the Colorimetric Assay Kit, respectively. RESULTS: Treatment of Jurkat T cells with DHURS (20-25 mug/ml) caused cytotoxicity and apoptotic DNA fragmentation along with Deltapsim loss, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9, -7, -3, and -8, and PARP degradation. However, these apoptotic events were abrogated by overexpression of Bcl-2. Pretreatment of the cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), the caspase-9 inhibitor (z-LEHD-fmk) or the caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) to prevent DHURS-induced apoptosis could block the activation of caspase-7 and -8, and PARP degradation, but not the Deltapsim loss, activation of caspase-9 and -3. Both FADD- and caspase-8-positive wild-type Jurkat clone A3, FADD-deficient Jurkat clone I2.1, and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat clone I9.2 exhibited similar susceptibilities to the cytotoxicity of DHURS, excluding an involvement of Fas/FasL system in triggering the apoptosis. The IC(50) value for Jurkat T cells was approximately 22 mug/ml, whereas that for human peripheral T cells was 25 mug/ml. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that DHURS-induced apoptogenic activity in Jurkat T cells, which was less potent in normal peripheral T cells, was mediated by Deltapsim loss, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and -3, leading to activation of caspase-7 and -8, which could be regulated by Bcl-2.","['Woo, Hyun Ju', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Lee, Ji Young', 'Woo, Mi Hee', 'Yang, Chae Ha', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Woo HJ', 'Jun do Y', 'Lee JY', 'Woo MH', 'Yang CH', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(11)00218-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2011.03.067 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2011 Jun 1;135(3):626-35. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2011.03.067.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 16 children (mean age 9.4 years) from the Gent University Hospital - Department Paediatric Oncology/haematology, suffering from chemotherapy-induced OM were selected. During clinical investigations, the OM grade was assessed using the WHO classification. All children were treated using a GaAlAs diode laser with 830 nm wavelength and a potency of 150 mW. The energy released was adapted according to the severity of the OM lesions. The same protocol was repeated every 48 hrs until healing of each lesion occurred. Subjective pain was monitored before and immediately after treatment by an appropriate pain scale and functional impairment was recorded. At each visit, related blood cell counts were recorded. RESULTS: After 12 mths, records were evaluated and information about treatment sequence, treatment sessions and frequencies related to the pain sensation and comfort were registered. Immediately after beaming the OM, pain relief was noticed. Depending on the severity of OM, on average, 2.5 treatments per lesion in a period of 1 week were sufficient to heal a mucositis lesion. CONCLUSIONS: LLLT, one of the most recent and promising treatment therapies, has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of mucositis and to relieve pain significantly. In the present study similar effects were obtained with the GaAlAs 830nm diode laser.

It was reported that feeder cells can be more beneficial to the oocyte and embryo by detoxifying the culture medium and supporting embryo development via different pathways. In this study, 432 patients, each with a minimum of three repeated implantation failures, were accepted for a prospective randomized study with or without autologous cumulus cell embryo co-culture and transfer at day 3 or day 5-6. We also investigated the expression of leukaemia inhibitor factor (LIF) and platelet activating factor receptor (PAF-R) on day 3 confluent cumulus cells. The statistic analysis of the data showed significant difference of implantation and clinical pregnancy rates between classical culture and day 3 compared with co-culture and day 5-6 transfer. The molecular analysis showed that cumulus cells express the LIF and the PAF-R genes and confirmed the possible positive role of growth factors and cytokines in early embryo development. Embryo co-culture systems with autologous cells can be beneficial in routine in vitro fertilization for embryo selection and implantation improvement. More molecular investigations need to be done to improve elucidation of the complex dialogue between the embryo and feeder cells prior to implantation and to understand the involved biological function and molecular process during embryo development.","['Benkhalifa, M', 'Demirol, A', 'Sari, T', 'Balashova, E', 'Tsouroupaki, M', 'Giakoumakis, Y', 'Gurgan, T']","['Benkhalifa M', 'Demirol A', 'Sari T', 'Balashova E', 'Tsouroupaki M', 'Giakoumakis Y', 'Gurgan T']","['ATL R&D Reproductive Biology & Genetics Laboratory, 4 Rue Louis Lormand, 78320 La Verriere, France.

Myelocytomatosis was the most common neoplasma observed in infected flocks; however, few cases of hemangioma caused by ALV-J were reported in recent year. RESULTS: An ALV-J strain SCDY1 associated with hemangioma was isolated and its proviral genomic sequences were determined. The full proviral sequence of SCDY1 was 7489 nt long. Homology analysis of the env, pol and gag gene between SCDY1 and other strains in GenBank were 90.3-94.2%, 96.6-97.6%, and 94.3-96.5% at nucleotide level, respectively; while 85.1-90.7%, 97.4-98.7%, and 96.2-98.4% at amino acid level, respectively. Alignment analysis of the genomic sequence of ALV-J strains by using HPRS-103 as reference showed that a special 11 bp deletion was observed in U3 region of 3'UTR of SCDY1 and another ALV-J strain NHH isolated from case of hemangioma, and the non-functional TM and E element were absent in the genome of SCDY1, but the transcriptional regulatory elements including C/EBP, E2BP, NFAP-1, CArG box and Y box were highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all analyzed ALV-J strains could be separated into four groups, and SCDY1 as well as another strain NHH were included in the same cluster. CONCLUSION: The variation in envelope glycoprotein was higher than other genes. The genome sequence of SCDY1 has a close relationship with that of another ALV-J strain NHH isolated from case of hemangioma. A 11 bp deletion observed in U3 region of 3'UTR of genome of ALV-J isolated from case of hemangioma is interesting, which may be associated with the occurrence of hemangioma.","['Shi, Min', 'Tian, Mingxing', 'Liu, Cheng', 'Zhao, Yang', 'Lin, Yan', 'Zou, Nianli', 'Liu, Ping', 'Huang, Yong']","['Shi M', 'Tian M', 'Liu C', 'Zhao Y', 'Lin Y', 'Zou N', 'Liu P', 'Huang Y']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University, Ya'an, Sichuan 625014, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-8-158 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-8-158 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2011 Apr 8;8:158. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-8-158.,10.1186/1743-422X-8-158 [doi],20110408,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Chick Embryo', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genome, Viral', 'Hemangioma/*veterinary/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Proviruses/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,PMC3080830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since RhoH is constantly bound by GTP, it is thought to be constitutively active and controlled predominantly by changes in quantitative expression. RhoH is produced specifically in haematopoietic cells and aberrant expression has been linked to various forms of leukaemia. Transcription of the RHOH gene is the first level at which the quantitative levels of the RhoH protein are regulated. Previous studies have demonstrated that RHOH gene transcription is initiated by three distinct promoter regions designated P1, P2 and P3 that define the 5' end of exons 1, 2 and 4 respectively. In the present study we report that the P3 promoter is largely responsible for RHOH gene transcription in the B-lymphocytic cell line Raji. The P3 promoter contains a minimal promoter region and a repressor region extending from -236 to +67 and +68 to +245 respectively, relative to the 5' end of exon 4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that two AP1 (activator protein 1) sites in the minimal promoter region bind JunD. When JUND is overexpressed, the endogenous RHOH gene is repressed; however, when JUND is inhibited, expression of endogenous RHOH is induced both in the Raji cell line and AML (acute myeloid leukaemia) cells. In the HCL (hairy cell leukaemia) cell line JOK-1, induction of RHOH increases expression of the alpha isoform of protein kinase C. This downstream target of RHOH is also induced in AML cells by JUND inhibition. Collectively, these data indicate that JunD is an inhibitor of RHOH gene expression.","['Delestre, Laure', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Figeac, Martin', 'Kerckaert, Jean-Pierre', 'Galiegue-Zouitina, Sylvie', 'Shelley, Carl Simon']","['Delestre L', 'Berthon C', 'Quesnel B', 'Figeac M', 'Kerckaert JP', 'Galiegue-Zouitina S', 'Shelley CS']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U.837, Centre Jean-Pierre Aubert, Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille and Universite Lille Nord de France, UDSL, 59000 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20100829 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20100829 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2011 Jul 1;437(1):75-88. doi: 10.1042/BJ20100829.,10.1042/BJ20100829 [doi],,"['0 (JunD protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RhoH protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He recovered after 24 hours in the pediatric intensive care unit. Laboratory investigation revealed that two of the four blood donors, from which the platelets and packed red cells had derived, had positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody screens. Further testing of these two donors revealed that one had a specific HLA antibody matching an antigen of the patient. This donor was implicated in the TRALI reaction. TRALI is often mistaken for other transfusion reactions, most notably pulmonary edema caused by circulatory overload or congestive heart failure. It is difficult to gauge which transfusion recipients are at risk for TRALI. Good judgment and transfusion practices when ordering blood products and recognition of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of TRALI is critical.","['Donelan, Kent J', 'Anderson, Keith A']","['Donelan KJ', 'Anderson KA']","['Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,S D Med,South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,101265265,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,S D Med. 2011 Mar;64(3):85-8.,,,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Lung Injury/diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'HLA Antigens/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regarding Paediatric Oncology, it is necessary to characterize this population to adequately direct its development. This report describes the incidence of childhood cancer in Trinidad and Tobago. PROCEDURE: The data were extracted from the National Cancer Registry of Trinidad and Tobago and the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex. Malignancies were coded with the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, 3rd edition. Incidence rates were calculated for the period 2001-2006, age 0-14 years and by county. RESULTS: The crude incidence rate of childhood cancer was 1.9 per 100,000 patient years (pyrs). One hundred and forty-five cases were reviewed for the six-year period with an incidence rate of 7.5 per 100,000 pyrs. The highest incidence was in children <5 years: 14 per 100,000 pyrs for males and 11.4 per 100,000 pyrs for females. Leukaemias and central nervous system tumours formed the majority of the cancers (58.6%), however nephroblastoma was more common than neuroblastoma especially in females <5 years: 2.7 per 100,000 pyrs compared with 1.2 per 100,000 pyrs for neuroblastoma. The incidence of all childhood cancers did not vary across counties, however there was a higher incidence of leukaemia in three counties. CONCLUSION: The results provide insight into the incidence of childhood cancer in Trinidad and Tobago. It is lower than in developed countries. There are some unique findings in the incidence of nephroblastoma in girls less than five years of age and the relatively higher incidence of leukaemia in three counties. Further analysis is required in these areas.","['Bodkyn, C', 'Lalchandani, S']","['Bodkyn C', 'Lalchandani S']","['Child Health Unit, Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago.

Unprecedented gains have been made in the cure rates for BL during the past two decades and these reflect steady improvements in treatment protocols and a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. However, the life-threatening side effects associated with conventional treatment urge us to explore new strategies. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), a natural product that has improved the prognosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) from highly fatal to highly curable, has also been proven to be effective in treating BL cell lines through multiple pathways in our study. Our data indicates that ATO can inhibit the proliferation of BL cell lines through 1) arresting the cell cycle; 2) decreasing the respiratory function and transmembrane potential of mitochondrial; and 3) downregulating the expressions of Survivin, Bcl-2, MCL-1, and VEGF. We therefore suggest that dissecting the pharmaceutical mechanism of ATO at the molecular and cellular levels may be a good strategy to explore the value of traditional natural products in treating high malignant Burkitt lymphoma.","['Li, Hui-Min', 'Long, Yi', 'Qing, Chen', 'Yu, Meijia', 'Li, Zhi-Hui', 'Zhang, Xue-Mei', 'Li, Xiao-Jin', 'Chen, Ya-Juan', 'Zhang, Yan-Li', 'Liang, Yang']","['Li HM', 'Long Y', 'Qing C', 'Yu M', 'Li ZH', 'Zhang XM', 'Li XJ', 'Chen YJ', 'Zhang YL', 'Liang Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical College, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China. lyyxh@126.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,2011/04/09 06:00,2011/05/11 06:00,['2011/04/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504011x12935427587885 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2011;19(3-4):149-63. doi: 10.3727/096504011x12935427587885.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*prevention & control', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 57 years old woman with bilateral lacrimal glands enlargement and chronic uveitis unresponsive to local steroids, was studied. Patient's general history was positive for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B cell (B-CLL); actually remission. The patient underwent complete ophthalmic examination with additional A and B-scan ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging of orbital cavities and also biopsy of both lacrimal glands was performed. RESULTS: USG, CT and NMR scans revealed the intraocular inflammation and inflammatory enlargement of both lacrimal glands. The histopathological examination of lacrimal glands showed the presence of lymphocytic infiltrations within the glands' tissue.

PATIENTS: 129 children aged 1 month-19,5 years with diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (74,4%) or a solid tumor (25,6%). Immune status was evaluated 6 months after cessation of treatment in order to plan active immunization. Effectiveness of vaccination against hepatitis B was performed too. PATIENTS who did not complete immunization against hepatitis B at the time of diagnosis continued vaccination according to the scheme 0-1-6 months, the others were given one doubled dose. In 90,7% patients complete immune reconstitution was observed and both mandatory and optional immunization was then resumed. In 5,4% of children vaccination with live vaccines was suspended due to moderate immune deficiencies. In 3,9% of patients severe immune deficiencies were diagnosed and vaccination was abandoned. At diagnosis of cancer double vaccine doses against hepatitis B were given to 94,6% of patients, while 5,4% continued standard vaccination scheme. After anticancer therapy anti-HBs titer >100 IU/ml was observed in 55%, 10-100 IU/ml in 26% and <10 IU/ml in 18,6% of patients. One case of HBV infection was noted. Neither adverse reactions after immunization nor life-threatening infections the patients were vaccinated against was noted.

This knowledge can be very helpful in improving effectiveness of arsenic-containing drugs used in chemotherapy of parasitoses as well as in treatment of acute promielyocytic leukemia. Increased proficiency of bioremediation of arsenic-contaminated soils can be obtained by using plants hyperaccumulating arsenic. This kind of plants can be engineered by modulating expression levels of genes encoding arsenic transporters. The same technique may be used to decrease levels of accumulated arsenic in crops.

Clinical correlations are required for validation. METHODS: Multicolor flow-cytometric evaluation of ZAP-70, CD38, CD69, CD26, CD49d, and CD27 was tested in 45 untreated-CLL patients. Four methods of ZAP-70 expression analysis and a scoring system were designed. A correlation analysis between ZAP-70 score, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) mutational status, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and these biomarkers was undertaken. RESULTS: There is a strong correlation between ZAP-70 expression and IGHV mutational status. The scoring system for a single reagent (P = 0.0006 or 0.0002) favors the use of multiple methods of analysis. The combined score was substantially equivalent (P = 0.0003). There was also a correlation with del 13q14 (P = 0.017) and trisomy12 (P = 0.011). A correlation for CD38 and ZAP-70 score was seen using both 1E7.2 AF488 and SBZAP PE when >/=20% or >/=7% cutoff was used. A positive correlation was seen for CD49d expression using both reagents. CD26 showed a correlation with ZAP-70 expression, but it was dependent upon the method of analysis. CD69 and CD27 showed no statistically significant correlation. CONCLUSION: In our study population, ZAP-70 expression is the better predictor of the IGHV mutational status. The correlation analysis confirms that the use of four methods of analysis with a single reagent or both reagents is superior to the use of a single method of analysis. The routine use of CD38, CD49d, and CD26 will require standardization.","['Degheidy, Heba A', 'Venzon, David J', 'Farooqui, Mohammed Z H', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M A', 'Marti, Gerald E']","['Degheidy HA', 'Venzon DJ', 'Farooqui MZ', 'Abbasi F', 'Arthur DC', 'Wilson WH', 'Wiestner A', 'Stetler-Stevenson MA', 'Marti GE']","['Division of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food & Drug Administration, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

However, interlaboratory variation is large, and there is neither a consensus nor a regulatory approved methodology. METHODS: Two anti-ZAP70 clones (1E7.2 and SBZAP) were compared in 45 untreated CLL patients. Nine different methods for ZAP-70 expression analysis were evaluated: M1, isotype control to determine negative; M2, internal residual T-cell to determine positive; M3, normal donor (ND) T-cell to determine positive; M4, internal T-cell/clone ratio; M5, ND residual T-cell/clone ratio; M6, clone/normal remaining B-cell ratio; M7, clone/ND B- cell ratio; M8, CLL-Z score; M9, modified CLL-Z score. A scoring system was designed integrating both 1E7.2 and SBZAP clones to assign ZAP-70 expression. RESULTS: The correlation coefficients for the four selected highest statistically significant methods were as follows (M1 = 0.71, M3 = 0.72, M7 = 0.67, and M9 = 0.64). These four methods were used to generate a combined score. The two reagents showed agreement using the designed scoring system for 37/45 samples (82%), and 8/45 (18%) showed equivocal result with one of the two clones. Seven of the eight equivocal samples were resolved using the scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: Four of the nine methods of analysis were compared for each reagent. The use of two independent ZAP-70 reagents increases analytical certitude and the scoring method aids in the resolution of equivocal results. The combined use of two reagents, four methods of analysis, and a scoring method allowed for assignment of ZAP-70 expression in 44/45 samples (98%) tested and improved performance of this important prognostic assay.","['Degheidy, Heba A', 'Venzon, David J', 'Farooqui, Mohammed Z H', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M A', 'Marti, Gerald E']","['Degheidy HA', 'Venzon DJ', 'Farooqui MZ', 'Abbasi F', 'Arthur DC', 'Wilson WH', 'Wiestner A', 'Stetler-Stevenson MA', 'Marti GE']","['Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food & Drug Administration, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

This paper discusses the problem of jointly identifying multiple differentially expressed gene sets associated with a phenotype of interest from many hundreds of pre-defined gene sets in a microarray experiment. We propose a null hypothesis that any group of gene sets from the experiment is not differentially expressed. The hypothesis is applicable to a real microarray experiment, where only a fraction of gene sets examined in the experiment are differentially expressed. To test this hypothesis, we provide an algorithm called set association for tail strength (SATS). SATS assigns the tail-strength statistic (TS) to each gene set to measure differential expression that is related to the phenotype of interest, combines the statistics into an overall association measure of multiple gene sets by utilizing a set-association method, and then calculates the significance of the overall measure by conducting sample permutations.

Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Ph-positive ALL carried a dismal prognosis and was characterized by a poor response to most chemotherapy combinations, short remission durations, and poor survival rates. Outcomes for patients with Ph-positive ALL improved substantially with the introduction of TKIs, and the TKI imatinib induced complete remissions in >95% of patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL when it was combined with chemotherapy. However, imatinib resistance remains a problem in a substantial proportion of patients with Ph-positive ALL, and multiple molecular mechanisms that contribute to imatinib resistance have been identified. Second-generation TKIs (eg, dasatinib and nilotinib) have demonstrated promising efficacy in the treatment of imatinib-resistant, Ph-positive ALL. Future strategies for Ph-positive ALL include novel, molecularly targeted treatment modalities and further evaluations of TKIs in combination with established antileukemic agents. For this article, the authors reviewed past, current, and future treatment approaches for adult and elderly patients with Ph-positive ALL with a focus on TKIs and combined chemotherapeutic regimens.","['Lee, Hun J', 'Thompson, James E', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Lee HJ', 'Thompson JE', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/06/08 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25690 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Apr 15;117(8):1583-94. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25690.

METHODS: The GCCR contacts parents or patients to collect and update information on a minimal set of follow-up health status data (e.g. late relapses, subsequent neoplasms, current address) and exchanges this information regularly with the appropriate clinical trials. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2010, GCCR approached a total of about 20,000 patients (contact at the age of 16 years, inquiry concerning the health status) in the context of long-term surveillance. 11,000 addresses of former patients had to be researched via municipal registrar's offices. The response rates ranged from 56% to 68%, the research in municipal offices provided 93-96% valid addresses. Of 46,115 patients diagnosed between 1980 and 2009, 25,283 are in long-term surveillance in 2010. DISCUSSION: Long-term surveillance requires considerable logistic effort at GCCR and requires that thousands of letters be mailed each year in order to ensure regularly updated information. Long-term surveillance is indispensable for a better understanding of late effects, subsequent neoplasms and quality of life of former childhood cancer patients.","['Grabow, D', 'Spix, C', 'Blettner, M', 'Kaatsch, P']","['Grabow D', 'Spix C', 'Blettner M', 'Kaatsch P']","['German Childhood Cancer Registry at Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Germany. desiree.grabow@unimedizin-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0031-1275352 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2011 May;223(3):159-64. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1275352.

Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis and caspases-9 and -3 activity were examined following treatment of U937 leukemia cells with 10 microM pipoxolan by flow cytometry and caspase-activity assay. The apoptosis-associated Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, were examined by Western blotting. We found that pipoxolan inhibited U937 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Morphological assessment and cell cycle analysis indicated that pipoxolan induced the apoptosis of the U937 cells. Pipoxolan (10 microM) increased ROS production and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential 1 h after pipoxolan treatment. Pre-treatment of pipoxolan-treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (a ROS chelator) inhibited the increase in ROS production. After treatment with 10 microM pipoxolan for 24 h, there was an increase in pro-apoptotic Bax and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. In vivo, we found that pipoxolan significantly suppressed tumor growth in BALB/cnu-/nu- mice inoculated with U937 cells.

Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK are fundamental survival pathways activated by exposure to most chemotherapeutical agents. However, the role of these pathways in the ADM-induced apoptosis of leukemia cells remains unclear. In the present study, ADM triggered dose-dependent cytotoxicity and resulted in a significant loss of cell viability in HL-60 cells. Moreover, treatment with ADM significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in the cells. Akt and ERK activation was also detected, and the inhibition of these two pathways resulted in the enhancement of ADM-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the PI3K/Akt and ERK survival pathways antagonize the chemotherapeutic effect of ADM.

To demonstrate its potential, PLK1- and MMP14-specific small hairpin RNA expression cassettes were applied in the system. Upon infection, PLK1 and MMP14 levels were reduced on mRNA and protein level. MLV-shPLK1-infected cells were arrested in the G2-phase and underwent apoptosis. MLV-shMMP14-infected cells showed reduced MMP2 activity, as well as substantially reduced invasion and tumour growth. In vivo, MLV-shLuc silenced luc expression in HT1080-luc tumour tissue by more than 80% and MLV-shPLK1 reduced tumour growth substantially, demonstrating the therapeutic relevance of this system. This RNAi vector system allows long-term downregulation of target gene expression as well as efficient delivery to and distribution throughout tumour tissue in vivo.","['Schaser, T', 'Wrede, C', 'Duerner, L', 'Sliva, K', 'Cichutek, K', 'Schnierle, B', 'Buchholz, C J']","['Schaser T', 'Wrede C', 'Duerner L', 'Sliva K', 'Cichutek K', 'Schnierle B', 'Buchholz CJ']","['Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,2011/04/08 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['gt201148 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2011.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2011 Oct;18(10):953-60. doi: 10.1038/gt.2011.48.

Exposure of cells to PEITC resulted in pronounced increase in the activation of caspase-3, -8, -9, cleavage/degradation of PARP, and apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manners. These events were accompanied by the caspase-independent downregulation of Mcl-1, inactivation of Akt, as well as activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of PI3K/Akt by LY294002 significantly enhanced PEITC-induced apoptosis. Conversely, enforced activation of Akt by a constitutively active Akt construct markedly abrogated PEITC-mediated JNK activation, Mcl-1 downregulation, caspase activation, and apoptosis, and also interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacological or genetically (e.g., siRNA) attenuated PEITC-induced apoptosis. Finally, administration of PEITC markedly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in U937 xenograft model in association with inactivation of Akt, activation of JNK, as well as downregulation of Mcl-1. Taken together, these findings represent a novel mechanism by which agents targeting Akt/JNK/Mcl-1 pathway potentiate PEITC lethality in transformed and primary human leukemia cells and inhibitory activity of tumor growth of U937 xenograft model.","['Gao, N', 'Budhraja, A', 'Cheng, S', 'Liu, E-H', 'Chen, J', 'Yang, Z', 'Chen, D', 'Zhang, Z', 'Shi, X']","['Gao N', 'Budhraja A', 'Cheng S', 'Liu EH', 'Chen J', 'Yang Z', 'Chen D', 'Zhang Z', 'Shi X']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, III Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. gaoning59@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201122 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2011.22 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2011 Apr 7;2:e140. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2011.22.,10.1038/cddis.2011.22 [doi],20110407,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['R01 ES015375/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3122055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from the metastatic setting suggest high tumor class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3) expression is a determinant of insensitivity to tubulin-targeting agents (e.g. vinorelbine, paclitaxel). In 265 patients from JBR.10 (vinorelbine-cisplatin versus observation), high TUBB3 was an adverse prognostic factor and was associated (nonsignificantly) with 'greater' survival benefit from chemotherapy. We explored this further in additional patients from JBR.10 and the other three trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TUBB3 immunohistochemical staining was scored for 1149 patients on the four trials. The original JBR.10 cut-off scores were used to classify tumors as TUBB3 high or low. The prognostic and predictive value of TUBB3 on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed by Cox models stratified by trial and adjusted for clinical factors. RESULTS: High TUBB3 expression was prognostic for OS [hazard ratio (HR)=1.27 (1.07-1.51), P=0.008) and DFS [HR=1.30 (1.11-1.53), P=0.001). TUBB3 was not predictive of a differential treatment effect [interaction P=0.20 (OS), P=0.23 (DFS)]. Subset analysis (n=420) on vinorelbine-cisplatin gave similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic effect of high TUBB3 expression in patients with R-NSCLC has been validated.

However, the solubility and sterility of LCC have not been considered yet. In the present study, complete solubilisation and sterilisation was achieved by autoclaving under mild alkaline conditions and the previously reported biological activities were re-examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LCCs were obtained by 1% NaOH extraction and acid precipitation, and a repeated extraction-precipitation cycle. Nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine productions were assayed by the Griess method and ELISA, respectively. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression was determined by Western blot analysis. Superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide radical-scavenging activity was determined by ESR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Cacao mass LCC showed reproducibly higher anti-HIV activity than cacao husk LCC. Cacao mass LCC, up to 62.5 mug/ml, did not stimulate mouse macrophage-like cells (RAW264.7 and J774.1) to produce NO, nor did it induce iNOS protein, in contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cacao mass LCC and LPS synergistically stimulated iNOS protein expression, suggesting a different point of action. Cacao mass LCC induced tumour necrosis factor-alpha production markedly less than LPS, and did not induce interleukin-1beta, interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma. ESR spectroscopy showed that cacao mass LCC, but not LPS, scavenged NO produced from NOC-7. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated several new biological activities of LCCs distinct from LPS and further confirmed the promising antiviral and immunomodulating activities of LCCs.","['Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Kawano, Michiyo', 'Thet, May Maw', 'Hashimoto, Ken', 'Satoh, Kazue', 'Kanamoto, Taisei', 'Terakubo, Shigemi', 'Nakashima, Hideki', 'Haishima, Yuji', 'Maeda, Yuuichi', 'Sakurai, Koji']","['Sakagami H', 'Kawano M', 'Thet MM', 'Hashimoto K', 'Satoh K', 'Kanamoto T', 'Terakubo S', 'Nakashima H', 'Haishima Y', 'Maeda Y', 'Sakurai K']","['Division of Pharmacology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan. sakagami@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/07/23 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['25/2/229 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2011 Mar-Apr;25(2):229-36.,,,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '9005-53-2 (Lignin)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cacao/*chemistry', 'Carbohydrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HIV-1/drug effects/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Lignin/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/virology', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that the chaperone calreticulin is activated in subgroups of AML patients and that calreticulin binds to the stem loop region of the CEBPA mRNA, thereby blocking CEBPA translation. In this study, we screened for additional CEBPA mRNA binding proteins and we identified protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein, to bind to the CEBPA mRNA stem loop region. We found that forced PDI expression in myeloid leukemic cells in fact blocked CEBPA translation, but not transcription, whereas abolishing PDI function restored CEBPA protein. In addition, PDI protein displayed direct physical interaction with calreticulin. Induction of ER stress in leukemic HL60 and U937 cells activated PDI expression, thereby decreasing CEBPA protein levels. Finally, leukemic cells from 25.4% of all AML patients displayed activation of the unfolded protein response as a marker for ER stress, and these patients also expressed significantly higher PDI levels. Our results indicate a novel role of PDI as a member of the ER stress-associated complex mediating blocked CEBPA translation and thereby suppressing myeloid differentiation in AML patients with activated unfolded protein response (UPR).","['Haefliger, Simon', 'Klebig, Christiane', 'Schaubitzer, Kerstin', 'Schardt, Julian', 'Timchenko, Nikolai', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Haefliger S', 'Klebig C', 'Schaubitzer K', 'Schardt J', 'Timchenko N', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45007-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-304485 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 2;117(22):5931-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-304485.

Loss of Smad4 accelerates the development of leukemia in vivo because of an increase in transformation of HSPCs. Therefore, the cytoplasmic binding of Hoxa9 by Smad4 is a mechanism to protect Hoxa9-induced transformation of normal HSPCs. Because Smad4 is a potent tumor suppressor involved in growth control, we developed a strategy to modify the subcellular distribution of Smad4. We successfully disrupted the interaction between Hoxa9 and Smad4 to activate the TGF-beta pathway and apoptosis, leading to a loss of LSCs. Together, these findings reveal a major role for Smad4 in the negative regulation of leukemia initiation and maintenance induced by HOXA9/NUP98-HOXA9 and provide strong evidence that antagonizing Smad4 stabilization by these oncoproteins might be a promising novel therapeutic approach in leukemia.","['Quere, Ronan', 'Karlsson, Goran', 'Hertwig, Falk', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Lindqvist, Beata', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Cammenga, Jorg', 'Karlsson, Stefan']","['Quere R', 'Karlsson G', 'Hertwig F', 'Rissler M', 'Lindqvist B', 'Fioretos T', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Slovak ML', 'Cammenga J', 'Karlsson S']","['Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45006-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-301879 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 2;117(22):5918-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-301879.

These tumors overexpress the major antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), a situation that could compensate for the lack of BCL-2. We report that ALK(+) ALCL cell lines and biopsy specimens (n = 20) express a low level of miR-29a and that this down-modulation requires an active NPM-ALK kinase. Murine models (transgenic mice and mouse embryonic fibroblast [MEF] cells), which allow conditional NPM-ALK fusion protein expression, showed an increase of miR-29a expression in the absence of NPM-ALK. Concordant results were observed after the abolition of NPM-ALK kinase activity (siALK or PF-2341066) in NPM-ALK(+) ALCL cell lines. In addition, we showed that low expression of miR-29a, probably through methylation repression, plays an important regulatory role in MCL-1 overexpression that could promote tumor cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Enforced miR-29a expression was found to modulate apoptosis through inhibition of MCL-1 expression in ALCL cell lines and in a xenografted model, with a concomitant tumor growth reduction. Thus, synthetic miR-29a represents a potential new tool to affect tumorigenesis in these lymphomas.","['Desjobert, Cecile', 'Renalier, Marie-Helene', 'Bergalet, Julie', 'Dejean, Emilie', 'Joseph, Nicole', 'Kruczynski, Anna', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Espinos, Estelle', 'Meggetto, Fabienne', 'Cavaille, Jerome', 'Delsol, Georges', 'Lamant, Laurence']","['Desjobert C', 'Renalier MH', 'Bergalet J', 'Dejean E', 'Joseph N', 'Kruczynski A', 'Soulier J', 'Espinos E', 'Meggetto F', 'Cavaille J', 'Delsol G', 'Lamant L']","['Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Universite Paul Sabatier, , Toulouse Cedex 3, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/09/03 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44925-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-301994 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 16;117(24):6627-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-301994.

In addition, some mature activated peripheral T cells can re-enter the thymus. We demonstrated in this study that adoptively transferred syngeneic Ag-specific T cells can enter the thymus of lymphopenic mice, where they delete thymic dendritic cells and medullary thymic epithelial cells in an Ag-specific fashion, without altering general thymic functions. This induced sustained thymic release of autoreactive self-Ag-specific T cells suggested that adoptively transferred activated T cells can specifically alter the endogenous T cell repertoire by erasing negative selection of their own specificities. Especially in clinical settings in which adoptively transferred T cells cause graft-versus-host disease or graft-versus-leukemia, as well as in adoptive tumor therapies, these findings might be of importance, because the endogenous T cell repertoire might be skewed to contribute to both manifestations.","['Edelmann, Stephanie L', 'Marconi, Peggy', 'Brocker, Thomas']","['Edelmann SL', 'Marconi P', 'Brocker T']","['Institute for Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, D-80336 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1004010 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1004010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 May 15;186(10):5612-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1004010.

In the current work, we performed studies to define further the mechanisms involved in the induction of BM failure in this system. BM chimera experiments revealed that IFNAR expression was required on BM-derived but not stroma-derived cells to prevent BM failure. Signals elicited after day 7 postinfection appeared critical in determining BM cell fate. We observed caspase-8- and caspase-9-mediated apoptotic cell death, beginning with neutrophils. Death of myeloid precursors was associated with secondary oxidative stress, and decreasing colony-forming activity in BM cell cultures. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine could slow the progression of, but not prevent, BM failure. Type I IFN signaling has previously been shown to expand the neutrophil life span and regulate the expression of some antiapoptotic factors. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated reduced mRNA abundance for the antiapoptotic factors BCL-2, IAP2, MCL-1, and others in BM cells from IFrag(-/-) compared with that in BM cells from RAG(-/-) mice at day 7. mRNA and protein for the proapoptotic cytokine TNF-alpha was increased, whereas mRNA for the growth factors G-CSF and GM-CSF was reduced. In vivo anti-TNF-alpha treatment improved precursor cell survival and activity in culture. Thus, we propose that lack of type I IFN signaling results in decreased resistance to inflammation-induced proapoptotic stressors and impaired replenishment by precursors after systemic responses to Pneumocystis lung infection. Our finding may have implications in understanding mechanisms underlying regenerative BM depression/failure during complex immune deficiencies such as AIDS.","['Taylor, David', 'Wilkison, Michelle', 'Voyich, Jovanka', 'Meissner, Nicole']","['Taylor D', 'Wilkison M', 'Voyich J', 'Meissner N']","['Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT 59718, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1003558 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1003558 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 May 15;186(10):5956-67. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1003558.

Consequently, we asked whether Sp100 is likewise involved in this repressive activity. Infection of Sp100 knockdown (kd) cells with HCMV resulted in a significantly increased plaque-forming ability. In addition, ablation of Sp100 led to a considerable increase in the number of IE1-expressing cells, indicating that Sp100 suppresses the initiation of viral gene expression. Next, double-kd cells, lacking either Sp100/hDaxx or Sp100/PML, were generated. Here, infection resulted in an additional enhancement in HCMV replication efficacy compared with the single-kd cells.

Linifanib (ABT-869) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that suppresses FLT3 signaling. In this article, we show that treatment with linifanib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ITD mutant cells in vitro and in vivo. We show that treatment with linifanib reduces phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta).

However, there have been discrepancies between results reported from clinical trials and population-based studies. We aimed to elucidate the extent of these discrepancies. METHODS: We examined the 5-year survival rate of patients in clinical trials of CML treatment and compared these results with the survival of patients in the general population using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, correcting for differences in the age structure of the patient populations. RESULTS: Twenty-nine trials were identified for data extraction. The survival rate calculated from SEER data was lower than the survival rate in clinical trials in the corresponding period, with differences of 2.1%-50.7%. Age-adapted survival was similar for four trials, but differences up to 35.8% were seen in most. Limitations of the study include the lack of information on chemotherapy in the SEER database and possible heterogeneity of cases. DISCUSSION: The survival rate in clinical trials of CML treatment is higher than the survival rate of all patients with CML.

During definitive hematopoiesis, expression of HoxA10 is maximal in committed myeloid progenitor cells and decreases as differentiation proceeds. Aberrantly increased expression of HoxA10 was found in bone marrow cells in a poor prognosis subset of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with this, AML developed in mice transplanted with HoxA10-overexpressing bone marrow. However, relatively few target genes have been identified that explain the role of HoxA10 in leukemogenesis. In the current study, we identified CDX4 as a HoxA10 target gene. Cdx4 is a homeodomain transcription factor that was also implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis. Although relatively few Cdx4 target genes have been identified, Cdx4 was known to influence HOX gene transcription. We identified a HoxA10-binding cis element in the CDX4 promoter that activated transcription. We also identified a Cdx4-binding cis element that activated the HOXA10 promoter. Therefore, increased Cdx4 expression in HoxA10-overexpressing cells augmented transcription of the endogenous HOXA10 gene. Increased endogenous HoxA10 in these cells induced additional CDX4 transcription. We found that Cdx4 influenced transcription of HoxA10 target genes in a HoxA10-dependent manner. Similarly, HoxA10 influenced transcription of HOX genes in a Cdx4-dependent manner. We previously found that HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitors were hypersensitive to a variety of cytokines. In the current studies, we found that Cdx4 knockdown decreased cytokine hypersensitivity of HoxA10-overexpressing cells. Therefore, these studies identified a positive feedback relationship between HoxA10 and Cdx4, which potentially amplified the contribution of either transcription factor to the pathogenesis of AML.","['Bei, Ling', 'Huang, Weiqi', 'Wang, Hao', 'Shah, Chirag', 'Horvath, Elizabeth', 'Eklund, Elizabeth']","['Bei L', 'Huang W', 'Wang H', 'Shah C', 'Horvath E', 'Eklund E']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/07/29 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51160-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.213983 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 May 27;286(21):19047-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.213983.

The proposed technique serves as an efficient tool for delivered dose verification and, potentially, plan adaptation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four patients with acute myelogenous leukemia treated with TBI using HT were selected for this study. The prescription was 12 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction, twice per day, given at least 6 h apart. The original plan achieved coverage of 80% of the clinical target volume (CTV) by the 12 Gy isodose surface. MVCTs were acquired prior to each treatment. Regions of interest were contoured on each MVCT. The dose for each fraction was calculated based on the MVCT using the HT planned adaptive station. B-spline deformable registration was conducted to establish voxel-to-voxel correspondence between the MVCT and the planning CT. The resultant deformation vector was employed to map the reconstructed dose from each fraction to the same point as the plan dose, and a voxel-to-voxel summed dose from all six fractions was obtained. The reconstructed dose distribution and its dosimetric parameters were compared with those of the original treatment plan. RESULTS: While changes in CTV contours occurred in all patients, the reconstructed dose distribution showed that the dose-volume histogram for CTV coverage was close (<1.5%) to that of the original plan. For sensitive structures, the differences between the reconstructed and the planned doses were less than 3.0%. CONCLUSION: Voxel-based dose reconstruction strategy that takes into account interfraction anatomical changes using MVCTs is a powerful tool for treatment verification of the delivered doses. This proposed technique can also be applied to adaptive TBI therapy using HT.","['Chao, Ming', 'Penagaricano, Jose', 'Yan, Yulong', 'Moros, Eduardo G', 'Corry, Peter', 'Ratanatharathorn, Vaneerat']","['Chao M', 'Penagaricano J', 'Yan Y', 'Moros EG', 'Corry P', 'Ratanatharathorn V']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205-7199, USA. mchao@uams.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,2011/04/08 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(11)00152-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.01.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Apr 1;82(5):1575-83. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.01.021.

Lastly, knocking down KLF5 or KLF6 in NB4 cells significantly attenuated neutrophil differentiation.

Herein we demonstrate that OSU-DY7, a novel D-tyrosinol derivative targeting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mediates cytotoxicity in lymphocytic cell lines representing CLL (MEC-1), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (697 cells), Burkitt lymphoma (Raji and Ramos) and primary B cells from CLL patients in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is dependent on caspase activation, as evidenced by induction of caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and rescue of cytotoxicity by Z-VAD-FMK. Interestingly, OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is mediated through activation of p38 MAPK, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and downstream target protein MAPKAPK2. Pretreatment of B-CLL cells with SB202190, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, results in decreased MAPKAPK2 protein level with concomitant rescue of the cells from OSU-DY7-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is associated with down regulation of p38 MAPK target BIRC5, that is rescued at protein and mRNA levels by SB202190. This study provides evidence for a role of OSU-DY7 in p38 MAPK activation and BIRC5 down regulation associated with apoptosis in B lymphocytic cells, thus warranting development of this alternative therapy for lymphoid malignancies.","['Bai, Li-Yuan', 'Ma, Yihui', 'Kulp, Samuel K', 'Wang, Shu-Huei', 'Chiu, Chang-Fang', 'Frissora, Frank', 'Mani, Rajeswaran', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Byrd, John C', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan']","['Bai LY', 'Ma Y', 'Kulp SK', 'Wang SH', 'Chiu CF', 'Frissora F', 'Mani R', 'Mo X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Byrd JC', 'Chen CS', 'Muthusamy N']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2011/04/08 06:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08443.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jun;153(5):623-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08443.x.

Weaker cell death-promoting effects were observed when the salophene moiety of 3 and 4 was replaced with saldach (complexes 7 and 8), indicating the influence exerted by the ligand structure.

It is today the indication for 10 % of all the total hip joint replacements. Known aetiologies of nontraumatic femoral head necrosis are alcoholism, steroids, sickle cell anaemia, caisson, and Gaucher's disease. Further risk factors are chemotherapy, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis, in which also steroids are involved. Gravidity is another risk factor, but still idiopathic pathogenesis is found. In diagnosis, the ARCO-classification of the Association for the Research of Osseous Circulation is essential. While stage 0 can only be found histologically, the reversible early stage 1 shows MR signal changes. In the irreversible early stage 2, first native x-ray changes are seen as lower radiolucency reflects new bone apposition on dead trabeculae. In stage 3, subchondral fracture follows, and in stage 4 secondary arthritis of the hip. Established therapy in stage 1 is core decompression, physiotherapy, and more and more also bisphosphonates. Sufficient data to support extracorporeal shock wave therapy are still lacking. Stem cell therapy seems to be a promising new therapy method in stage 2. In stage 2 and 3 mainly proximal femoral osteotomies and (non)vascularised bone transplantation are performed. In stage 4, depending on size and location of the necrotic zone and pathology of the adjacent bone, resurfacing or short stem hip arthroplasty can be performed. However, conventional THA is still golden standard. The problem and challenge, however, is the often young patient age in femoral head necrosis. Especially chemotherapy-associated osteonecrosis in leukaemia is found in patients in their second decade of life. Therefore, the hip should be preserved as long as possible.","['Drescher, W', 'Pufe, T', 'Smeets, R', 'Eisenhart-Rothe, R V', 'Jager, M', 'Tingart, M']","['Drescher W', 'Pufe T', 'Smeets R', 'Eisenhart-Rothe RV', 'Jager M', 'Tingart M']","['Klinik fur Orthopadie und Unfallchirurgie - Schwerpunkt Orthopadie, RWTH Universitatsklinikum Aachen. wdrescher@ukaachen.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Orthop Unfall,Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und Unfallchirurgie,101308227,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/09/08 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0030-1270984 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Orthop Unfall. 2011 Apr;149(2):231-40; quiz 241-2. doi: 10.1055/s-0030-1270984.

We conducted a mortality study for adverse health effects that workers may have suffered while working at the plant, including exposures to chemicals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a cohort of 6820 workers at the PGDP for the period 1953 to 2003; there were a total of 1672 deaths to cohort members. Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a specific concern for this workforce; exposure to TCE occurred primarily in departments that clean the process equipment. The Life Table Analysis System (LTAS) program developed by NIOSH was used to calculate the standardized mortality ratios for the worker cohort and standardized rate ratio relative to exposure to TCE (the U.S. population is the referent for ageadjustment). LTAS calculated a significantly low overall SMR for these workers of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72-0.79). A further review of three major cancers of interest to Kentucky produced significantly low SMR for trachea, bronchus, lung cancer (0.75, 95% CI: 0.72-0.79) and high SMR for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (1.49, 95% CI: 1.02-2.10). RESULTS: No significant SMR was observed for leukemia and no significant SRRs were observed for any disease. Both the leukemia and lung cancer results were examined and determined to reflect regional mortality patterns. However, the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma finding suggests a curious amplification when living cases are included with the mortality experience. CONCLUSIONS: Further examination is recommended of this recurrent finding from all three U.S. Gaseous Diffusion plants.","['Bahr, Debra E', 'Aldrich, Timothy E', 'Seidu, Dazar', 'Brion, Gail M', 'Tollerud, David J', 'Muldoon, Susan', 'Reinhart, Nancy', 'Youseefagha, Ahmed', 'McKinney, Paul', 'Hughes, Therese', 'Chan, Caroline', 'Rice, Carol', 'Brewer, David E', 'Freyberg, Ronald W', 'Mohlenkamp, Adriane Moser', 'Hahn, Kristen', 'Hornung, Richard', 'Ho, Mona', 'Dastidar, Aniruddha', 'Freitas, Samantha', 'Saman, Daniel', 'Ravdal, Hege', 'Scutchfield, Douglas', 'Eger, Kenneth J', 'Minor, Steve']","['Bahr DE', 'Aldrich TE', 'Seidu D', 'Brion GM', 'Tollerud DJ', 'Muldoon S', 'Reinhart N', 'Youseefagha A', 'McKinney P', 'Hughes T', 'Chan C', 'Rice C', 'Brewer DE', 'Freyberg RW', 'Mohlenkamp AM', 'Hahn K', 'Hornung R', 'Ho M', 'Dastidar A', 'Freitas S', 'Saman D', 'Ravdal H', 'Scutchfield D', 'Eger KJ', 'Minor S']","['College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2478/s13382-011-0007-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2011 Mar;24(1):67-77. doi: 10.2478/s13382-011-0007-1.

In a xenograft mouse model it was described that availability of free VEGFA versus bound VEGFA is related to different vascular morphology. In this study we investigate the relationship between vascular morphology within AML bone marrow biopsies and AML derived VEGFA levels. METHODS: Vessel count and surface area (Chalkley count) were calculated in AML bone marrow biopsies at diagnosis (n = 32), at remission (n = 8) and Normal Bone Marrow (n = 32) using immunohistochemical staining for FVIII, CD31, CTIV, SMA and VEGFA. VEGFA protein levels were measured. RESULTS: High vessel count was associated with an immature vessel status. Combining vessel count and Chalkley count different vessel morphology patterns were quantified within AML bone marrow biopsies. Three different subgroups could be distinguished. The subgroup (37.5% of the samples) exhibiting a high vessel count and vessels with predominantly large lumen (normal Chalkley count) was associated with high secreted VEGFA protein levels. CONCLUSION: Different vasculature patterns are seen in AML bone marrow biopsies, defined by combining number and size of vessel. These quantified morphology patterns, combined with VEGFA levels, might be of value in the success of VEGF/VEGFR-signaling interference approaches.","['Weidenaar, Alida C', 'ter Elst, Arja', 'Koopmans-Klein, Gineke', 'Rosati, Stefano', 'den Dunnen, Wilfred F A', 'Meeuwsen-de Boer, Tiny', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M']","['Weidenaar AC', 'ter Elst A', 'Koopmans-Klein G', 'Rosati S', 'den Dunnen WF', 'Meeuwsen-de Boer T', 'Kamps WA', 'Vellenga E', 'de Bont ES']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,2011/04/07 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13402-011-0017-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2011 Aug;34(4):289-96. doi: 10.1007/s13402-011-0017-9.

Here, we analyzed the genomic polymorphism of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA class I cognate ligands in patients with certified CFS. An excess of KIR3DS1 was found in CFS patients with respect to controls, as well as an increased frequency of the genotype missing KIR2DS5. Forty-four CFS patients and 50 controls also underwent genomic typing for the HLA-ligands. In the patients, a great proportion of KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1 receptors were found to be missing their HLA-Bw4Ile80 binding motif.

Taken together, our results indicate that targeted PKR activation led to selective apoptosis induction in K562 cells, which correlated with caspase-8 activity and enhanced expression of BAX.","['Li, Ya-Juan', 'Zeng, Jian-Ming', 'Huang, Shi-Feng', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong', 'Zhao, Shi-Qiao', 'Bai, Wei-Jun', 'Cao, Wei-Xi', 'Huang, Zong-Gan', 'Feng, Wen-Li']","['Li YJ', 'Zeng JM', 'Huang SF', 'Wang XZ', 'Zhao SQ', 'Bai WJ', 'Cao WX', 'Huang ZG', 'Feng WL']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors are currently under investigation for their therapeutic value in a variety of conditions. Through multiple mechanisms, they induce apoptosis or inhibition of tumor cell growth. Some studies have also shown histone deacetylase inhibitors to have synergistic activity with existing therapeutic agents in selected conditions. Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with a promising efficacy and safety profile that may represent a valuable treatment alternative for patients with treatment-resistant mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. AIMS: To review emerging evidence regarding the use of romidepsin in the management of treatment-resistant CTCL. EVIDENCE REVIEW: There is evidence that romidepsin can induce significant and durable responses in patients with refractory CTCL. In two independent Phase II trials including a total of 167 patients with CTCL, there was an overall response rate of 34% with a partial response of 28% and complete response rate of 6%. The most frequent toxicities reported from the Phase II trials were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, and dysgeusia. CLINICAL POTENTIAL: Romidepsin may be an effective therapeutic option for patients with CTCL who have had treatment failure with multiple standard treatment modalities.","['Poligone, Brian', 'Lin, Janet', 'Chung, Catherine']","['Poligone B', 'Lin J', 'Chung C']","['Wilmot Cancer Center, Department of Dermatology, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Core Evid,Core evidence,101256593,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/04/07 06:01,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/CE.S9084 [doi]'],ppublish,Core Evid. 2011;6:1-12. doi: 10.2147/CE.S9084.

We analyzed gene expression data sets generated on the Affymetrix U133 platform from 22 MGUS and 101 MM patients using gene-set enrichment analysis. Genes overexpressed in MM were enriched for cell cycle, proliferation and MYC activation gene sets. Upon dissecting the relationship between MYC and cell-cycle gene sets, we identified and validated an MYC activation signature dissociated from proliferation. Applying this signature, MYC is activated in 67% of myeloma, but not in MGUS. This was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using membrane CD138 and nuclear MYC double staining. We also showed that almost all tumors with RAS mutations expressed the MYC activation signature, and multiple mechanisms may be involved in activating MYC. MYC activation, whether assessed by gene-expression signature or IHC, is associated with hyperdiploid MM and shorter survival even in tumors that are not proliferative. Bortezomib treatment is able to overcome the survival disadvantage in patients with MYC activation.","['Chng, W-J', 'Huang, G F', 'Chung, T H', 'Ng, S B', 'Gonzalez-Paz, N', 'Troska-Price, T', 'Mulligan, G', 'Chesi, M', 'Bergsagel, P L', 'Fonseca, R']","['Chng WJ', 'Huang GF', 'Chung TH', 'Ng SB', 'Gonzalez-Paz N', 'Troska-Price T', 'Mulligan G', 'Chesi M', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Fonseca R']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Scottsdale, AZ, USA. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201153 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.53 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jun;25(6):1026-35. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.53.

Our long-term aim is to find a BcrAbl-independent drug that can be combined with a TKI to improve overall disease response in chronic-phase CML. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate, a first in class cetaxine, has been evaluated by clinical trials in TKI-insensitive/resistant CML. Omacetaxine inhibits synthesis of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, including (myeloid cell leukaemia) Mcl-1, leading to cell death. Omacetaxine effectively induced apoptosis in primary CML stem cells (CD34(+)38(lo)) by downregulation of Mcl-1 protein. In contrast to our previous findings with TKIs, omacetaxine did not accumulate undivided cells in vitro. Furthermore, the functionality of surviving stem cells following omacetaxine exposure was significantly reduced in a dose-dependant manner, as determined by colony forming cell and the more stringent long-term culture initiating cell colony assays. This stem cell-directed activity was not limited to CML stem cells as both normal and non-CML CD34(+) cells were sensitive to inhibition. Thus, although omacetaxine is not leukaemia stem cell specific, its ability to induce apoptosis of leukaemic stem cells distinguishes it from TKIs and creates the potential for a curative strategy for persistent disease.","['Allan, E K', 'Holyoake, T L', 'Craig, A R', 'Jorgensen, H G']","['Allan EK', 'Holyoake TL', 'Craig AR', 'Jorgensen HG']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201155 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.55 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jun;25(6):985-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.55.

All the fusion proteins have an identical NUP98 N terminus, which contains the GLEBS motif for interaction with the mRNA export factor RAE1 and FG repeats that associate with the transcription factors HDAC1 and p300. It is virtually unknown whether these interaction partners affect leukemogenesis. We previously showed that RAE1 depletion caused aneuploidy, which enhanced tumorigenesis. We speculated that RAE1 may also be directly involved in NUP98 fusion-mediated leukemogenesis. We show here that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of NUP98 caused severe chromosome segregation defects and disrupted RAE1 but not HDAC1 expression and localization. Next, we performed rescue experiments to confirm that the RAE1-NUP98 complex orchestrates proper chromosome segregation. Interestingly, we found diverse behaviors of NUP98 and the leukemogenic fusion protein NUP98-HOXA9 throughout the cell cycle. Strikingly, in NUP98-HOXA9-transfected cells, RAE1 protein were reduced and mis-localized. Our cellular interpretations were further confirmed by NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic mice and the NUP98-HOXA9 AML patient.

Two branches of the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway are reported: ""transcription-dependent"" and ""transcription-independent."" However, the relative contribution of each in different types of cells is not yet clearly defined. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the codon 72 polymorphic variants of p53 show different sensitivities to apoptosis signals. The Arg72 variant has a more potent apoptosis-inducing activity in mitochondria than the Pro72 variant. Here, we initially investigated the codon 72 polymorphism of p53 in MOLT-4 cells. Analysis of the p53 exon 4 genomic DNA sequence, which includes codon 72, revealed that MOLT-4 cells are homozygous for the allele encoding Arg72. We next investigated the involvement of the transcription-independent function of p53 using an RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D (ActD), and a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), and found that the apoptosis was suppressed by CHX but not by ActD. We also revealed that the suppressive effect of CHX on apoptosis was specifically mediated by p53, using a p53-knockdown MOLT-4 transfectant. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of CHX on apoptosis was highly correlated with the suppression of p53 protein accumulation, and less correlated with the suppression of p53 target genes expression. These results indicated that p53 transactivation is not necessary to induce apoptosis, and that p53 protein accumulation itself is both necessary and sufficient to do so.","['Ito, Azusa', 'Morita, Akinori', 'Ohya, Soichiro', 'Yamamoto, Shinichi', 'Enomoto, Atsushi', 'Ikekita, Masahiko']","['Ito A', 'Morita A', 'Ohya S', 'Yamamoto S', 'Enomoto A', 'Ikekita M']","['Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/10151 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.10151 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2011;52(3):342-50. doi: 10.1269/jrr.10151.

We investigated the occurrence of cross-intolerance to nilotinib in imatinib-intolerant patients with CML. Only 1/75 (1%) patients with nonhematologic imatinib intolerance experienced a similar grade 3/4 adverse event (AE), and 3/75 (4%) experienced a similar persistent grade 2 nonhematologic AE on nilotinib. Only 7/40 (18%) patients with hematologic imatinib intolerance discontinued nilotinib, all because of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Ninety percent of imatinib-intolerant patients with CML-CP who did not have complete hematologic response (CHR) at baseline (n = 52) achieved CHR on nilotinib. Nilotinib induced a major cytogenetic response in 66% and 41% of patients with imatinib-intolerant CML-CP and CML-AP (complete cytogenetic response in 51% and 30%), respectively. Minimal cross-intolerance was confirmed in patients with imatinib-intolerant CML. The favorable tolerability of nilotinib in patients with imatinib intolerance leads to alleviation of AE-related symptoms and significant and durable responses.

However, we recently identified mutations in the 5'-untranslated region of the ANKRD26 gene in 9 THC2 families. Here we report on 12 additional pedigrees with ANKRD26 mutations, 6 of which are new. Because THC2 affected 21 of the 210 families in our database, it has to be considered one of the less rare forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. Analysis of all 21 families with ANKRD26 mutations identified to date revealed that thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendency were usually mild. Nearly all patients had no platelet macrocytosis, and this characteristic distinguishes THC2 from most other forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. In the majority of cases, platelets were deficient in glycoprotein Ia and alpha-granules, whereas in vitro platelet aggregation was normal. Bone marrow examination and serum thrombopoietin levels suggested that thrombocytopenia was derived from dysmegakaryopoiesis. Unexplained high values of hemoglobin and leukocytes were observed in a few cases. An unexpected finding that warrants further investigation was a high incidence of acute leukemia. Given the scarcity of distinctive characteristics, the ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia has to be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of isolated thrombocytopenias.","['Noris, Patrizia', 'Perrotta, Silverio', 'Seri, Marco', 'Pecci, Alessandro', 'Gnan, Chiara', 'Loffredo, Giuseppe', 'Pujol-Moix, Nuria', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Scognamiglio, Francesca', 'De Rocco, Daniela', 'Punzo, Francesca', 'Melazzini, Federica', 'Scianguetta, Saverio', 'Casale, Maddalena', 'Marconi, Caterina', 'Pippucci, Tommaso', 'Amendola, Giovanni', 'Notarangelo, Lucia D', 'Klersy, Catherine', 'Civaschi, Elisa', 'Balduini, Carlo L', 'Savoia, Anna']","['Noris P', 'Perrotta S', 'Seri M', 'Pecci A', 'Gnan C', 'Loffredo G', 'Pujol-Moix N', 'Zecca M', 'Scognamiglio F', 'De Rocco D', 'Punzo F', 'Melazzini F', 'Scianguetta S', 'Casale M', 'Marconi C', 'Pippucci T', 'Amendola G', 'Notarangelo LD', 'Klersy C', 'Civaschi E', 'Balduini CL', 'Savoia A']","['Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, University of Pavia, Piazzale Golgi, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/09/03 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44930-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-336537 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 16;117(24):6673-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-336537.

Polyphenol entry into the cells has remained poorly understood. Here, we show that [(3)H]-resveratrol enters colon cancer cells (SW480, SW620, HT29) and leukemia U937 cells through a monensin (5-20 mumol/L) -sensitive process that suggests clathrin-independent endocytosis. Uptake of the molecule can be prevented by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (2-12 mg/mL), nystatin (12 ng/mL), and filipin (1 mug/mL), which all disrupt plasma membrane lipid rafts. Accordingly, radiolabeled resveratrol accumulates in sphingomyelin- and cholesterol-enriched cell fractions. Interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNK), and Akt also accumulate in lipid rafts on resveratrol exposure (IC(50) at 48 h approximately 30 mumol/L in SW480 and U937 cells). In these rafts also, resveratrol promotes the recruitment, by the integrin alpha(V)beta(3) (revealed by coimmunoprecipitation with an anti-integrin alpha(V)beta(3) antibody), of signaling molecules that include the FAK (focal adhesion kinase), Fyn, Grb2, Ras, and SOS proteins. Resveratrol-induced activation of downstream signaling pathways and caspase-dependent apoptosis is prevented by endocytosis inhibitors, lipid raft-disrupting molecules, and the integrin antagonist peptide arginine-glycine-aspartate (500 nmol/L). Altogether, these data show the role played by lipid rafts in resveratrol endocytosis and activation of downstream pathways leading to cell death.","['Colin, Didier', 'Limagne, Emeric', 'Jeanningros, Sylvie', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Lizard, Gerard', 'Athias, Anne', 'Gambert, Philippe', 'Hichami, Aziz', 'Latruffe, Norbert', 'Solary, Eric', 'Delmas, Dominique']","['Colin D', 'Limagne E', 'Jeanningros S', 'Jacquel A', 'Lizard G', 'Athias A', 'Gambert P', 'Hichami A', 'Latruffe N', 'Solary E', 'Delmas D']","['Inserm UMR866, 6 Boulevard Gabriel, 21000 Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-10-0274 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0274 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2011 Jul;4(7):1095-106. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0274.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently under important mutations because of better understanding of the GVT mechanisms and the development of new treatment techniques with: (a) allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells after mobilization with G-CSF and allotransplant of cord blood cells; (b) increase number of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated and haplo-identical donors; (c) immunomodulation according to the chimerism and residual disease documentation with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI); (d) development of reduced intensity conditioning regimens aiming to reduce the toxicity while favoring the immune component of the anti-tumoral effect; (e) development of sequential chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after reduced intensity conditioning in case of refractory diseases.

In contrast, imatinib did not induce ER stress responses and unexpectedly downregulated DR4/DR5 expression, indicating that sensitization of Ph1-positive leukemia cells to TRAIL-mediated cellular immunity by imatinib through upregulation of DR4/DR5 expression is unlikely.","['Zhang, Xiaochun', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Akahane, Koshi', 'Hirose, Kinuko', 'Kuroda, Itaru', 'Honna, Hiroko', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Sugita, Kanji']","['Zhang X', 'Inukai T', 'Akahane K', 'Hirose K', 'Kuroda I', 'Honna H', 'Goi K', 'Kagami K', 'Tauchi T', 'Yagita H', 'Sugita K']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, 1110 Shimokato, Chuo, Yamanashi 409-3898, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00149-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Jul;35(7):940-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.03.016.

In these cases, CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell responses are induced depending on the mismatched HLA class I or II allele(s). Herein, we report on an HLA-DRB1*08:03-restricted CD8(+) CTL clone, named CTL-1H8, isolated from a patient following an HLA-DR-mismatched HSCT from his brother. Lysis of a patient Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line (B-LCL) by CTL-1H8 was inhibited after the addition of blocking antibodies against HLA-DR and CD8, whereas antibodies against pan-HLA class I or CD4 had no effect. The 1H8-CTL clone did not lyse the recipient dermal fibroblasts whose HLA-DRB1*08:03 expression was upregulated after 1 week cytokine treatment. Engraftment of HLA-DRB1*08:03-positive primary leukemic stem cells in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient/gammac-null (NOG) mice was completely inhibited by the in vitro preincubation of cells with CTL-1H8, suggesting that HLA-DRB1*08:03 is expressed on leukemic stem cells. Finally, analysis of the precursor frequency of CD8(+) CTL specific for recipient antigens in post-HSCT peripheral blood T cells revealed a significant fraction of the total donor CTL responses towards the individual mismatched HLA-DR antigen in two patients. These findings underscore unexpectedly significant CD8 T cell responses in the context of HLA class II.","['Hirosawa, Tomoya', 'Torikai, Hiroki', 'Yanagisawa, Mayumi', 'Kamei, Michi', 'Imahashi, Nobuhiko', 'Demachi-Okamura, Ayako', 'Tanimoto, Miyoko', 'Shiraishi, Keiko', 'Ito, Mamoru', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Shibata, Kiyosumi', 'Kikkawa, Fumitaka', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Takahashi, Toshitada', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Kuzushima, Kiyotaka', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki']","['Hirosawa T', 'Torikai H', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Kamei M', 'Imahashi N', 'Demachi-Okamura A', 'Tanimoto M', 'Shiraishi K', 'Ito M', 'Miyamura K', 'Shibata K', 'Kikkawa F', 'Morishima Y', 'Takahashi T', 'Emi N', 'Kuzushima K', 'Akatsuka Y']","['Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01949.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Jul;102(7):1281-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01949.x.

After successful chemotherapy in patients with AL, the growth of leukemic cell is thought to be replaced by the recovery of normal hematopoietic cells as a consequence of the activity of anti-cancer agents in eradicating all hematopoietic cells, whether or not they are leukemic cells. However, little is known about the effects of anti-cancer agents on marrow stromal cells, which play a crucial role in supporting hematopoietic cell development. In the present study, we investigated the direct activity of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), a key drug for treatment of AL, on human non-leukemic marrow stromal cells by analyzing the effect of Ara-C on gene expression. METHODS: Stromal cells were established from 11 patients with no neoplastic hematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow. The cells were treated with Ara-C for one week, co-cultured with allogeneic CD34-positive cells, and subjected to colony assay to evaluate their supportive function. A genome-wide DNA microarray analysis was performed to determine Ara-C-induced changes in gene expression in the stromal cells. RESULTS: Treatment of the stromal cells with Ara-C resulted in a dose-dependent increase in their supportive function. These effects were more evident in the late phase than in the early phase of co-culture with CD34-positive cells, suggesting that Ara-C-treated stromal cells preferably support very immature cells, rather than committed progenitor cells. Furthermore, gene expression profiling with DNA microarrays revealed prominent up-regulation of growth-differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a divergent member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, with concomitant down-regulation of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), both of which are predominantly expressed on macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Our present study demonstrated that Ara-C directly enhanced the ability of stromal cells to support the development of immature hematopoietic cells, possibly by modulating the function of macrophages in the bone marrow microenvironment. This novel action of Ara-C in the marrow microenvironment may contribute to the better understanding and management of chemotherapy for AL.","['Li, HongZhang', 'Koh, Ki-Ryang', 'Toramoto, Takuya', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Yamane, Takahisa', 'Ohta, Kensuke', 'Hino, Masayuki']","['Li H', 'Koh KR', 'Toramoto T', 'Nakamae H', 'Yamane T', 'Ohta K', 'Hino M']","['Department of Hematology, Osaka City University, Graduate School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Osaka City Med J,Osaka city medical journal,0376413,2011/04/07 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2011/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Osaka City Med J. 2010 Dec;56(2):11-20.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (GDF15 protein, human)', '0 (Growth Differentiation Factor 15)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 15', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The Avian Leukosis Virus Subgroup A (ALV-A) SDAU09E1 strain was inoculated into DF1 cells, an ALV-A- gp85 DNA fragment of 1023 bp was amplified from infected cells and inserted into PET-32a(+) plasmid at the location between restriction endonucleases BamH I and Not I sites. The recombinant plasmid PET-SDAU09E1 -gp85 was transformed into E coli. BL21 (Rosetta) for gp85 gene expression. Then we used the purified recombinant fusion protein to immunize 6 weeks old Kunming white mice, and the antiserum were prepared. RESULTS: The recombinant ALV-A gp85 fusion protein with a molecular weight of 52.8 kDa demonstrated a good antigenecity.

The purpose of the current study was to determine the HRQOL scores in children with acute leukemia and to compare the scores for those on maintenance chemotherapy with those off-treatment as well as to determine factors which might affect HRQOL. METHODS: Seventy-seven children in a pediatric oncology center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia diagnosed with acute leukemia were consecutively enrolled, of whom 22 were on maintenance chemotherapy and 55 off-treatment. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Scales were used to assess HRQOL. RESULTS: Children on maintenance chemotherapy had significantly lower child self-report HRQOL scores across all domains (P < 0.001) especially psychosocial health compared with those who were off-treatment. Also, parents with children on maintenance chemotherapy reported significantly lower HRQOL scores across all domains (P < 0.05) except social functioning compared with parents with children off-treatment.

METHODS: This was an open label, multi-center phase II clinical trial. Courses were defined as consecutive 28-day intervals. Oral imatinib was administered daily at 340 mg/m(2) without interruption in the absence of toxicity. RESULTS: Fifty-one children received 978 28-day courses of imatinib. The most common toxicities encountered were hematologic. Forty-one patients (80%) achieved a complete hematologic response by the end of course 2. Nineteen children (38%) obtained a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at the end of course 3. Overall, 72% achieved CCyR at a median time of 5.6 months.

The authors sought to determine whether there was an association among lymphoma, sarcoma, and the associated treatments for these diseases. METHODS: From the authors' prospective soft tissue sarcoma (STS) database of 8240 patients, they identified 112 patients with STS and lymphoma treated from 1982 to 2009 who had complete follow-up data. They examined the importance of the initial diagnosis in patients with both STS and lymphoma, in addition to determining the role of radiation therapy, a known inducer of sarcoma. RESULTS: Review of their sarcoma, gastric, urology, breast, and gynecology databases revealed that lymphoma (95%) or leukemia (5%) occurred in 1.6% of STS patients in comparison to 0.5% of patients in the other databases (P < .01; odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.8). Patients diagnosed with STS only were more likely to die of disease at 10 years compared with those with STS and lymphoma (P = .006), but this difference was not significant when patients presenting with recurrence or metastases were excluded. Among patients with lymphoma and STS, lymphoma was the first diagnosis in 71% of patients. Median survival after STS diagnosis was shorter when lymphoma was the initial diagnosis (67 vs 170 months, P = .002), and these patients were more likely to have radiation-associated STS (44% vs 3%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a 3-fold higher incidence of lymphoma in STS patients compared with other solid tumors. The poor prognosis of those diagnosed with both STS and lymphoma was most likely a consequence of prior irradiation.","['Katz, Steven C', 'Baldwin, Keith', 'Karakousis, Giorgos', 'Moraco, Nicole', 'Buglino, Anthony', 'Singer, Samuel', 'Brennan, Murray F']","['Katz SC', 'Baldwin K', 'Karakousis G', 'Moraco N', 'Buglino A', 'Singer S', 'Brennan MF']","['Gastric and Mixed Tumor Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/06 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26105 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Oct 15;117(20):4756-63. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26105.

However, little is known about the detailed mechanisms of arsenic-induced cardiotoxicity or cardiac factors involved in high sensitivity to arsenicals in spite of the fact that arsenic trioxide, which is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, causes cardiotoxicity. Here, we show that rat H9c2(2-1) cardiac myocytes exhibit high sensitivity to inorganic arsenite (As(III)) as compared with rat-derived four cell lines (liver epithelial TRL1215 cells, kidney epithelial NRK-52E cells, PC12 phechromocytoma cells and C6 glioma cells). Furthermore, we found a lower steady-state level of glutathione and glutamyl-cysteine ligase (GCL) in H9c2(2-1) cells compared with TRL1215 cells, resulting in an increase in arsenic accumulation. In addition, we detected that the up-regulation of GCL and multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP) caused by As(III) was extremely low in H9c2(2-1) cells compared with TRL1215 cells. It is known that Nrf2, which regulates GCL and MRP expression, plays an important role in the protection of cells from arsenicals. We investigated the participation of Nrf2 in the difference of sensitivity to arsenicals between H9c2(2-1) and TRL1215 cells and found that Nrf2 was clearly activated by As(III) exposure in TRL1215 cells but only poorly activated in H9c2(2-1) cells. Considering these results together, we propose that modest activation of Nrf2 during exposure to As(III) in H9c2(2-1) cardiac myocytes leads to reduced ability to metabolize and excrete arsenic.","['Sumi, Daigo', 'Sasaki, Takahiko', 'Miyataka, Hideki', 'Himeno, Seiichiro']","['Sumi D', 'Sasaki T', 'Miyataka H', 'Himeno S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Nutrition and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Yamashiro-cho, Tokushima 770-8514, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,2011/04/06 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-011-0700-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2011 Dec;85(12):1509-16. doi: 10.1007/s00204-011-0700-7.

Ascorbate enhanced the toxic effects of quinones with first half-wave potential E(I) (1/2) values in the range of -480 to -660 mV. Phenylaminoquinones that were unsubstituted at position 6 exhibited greater cytotoxic activity than did their 6-methyl-substituted analogues. Two groups of compounds were further selected, namely 8-10 and 20-22, to study the cellular mechanisms involved in quinone cytotoxicity. Indeed, these compounds have the same range of redox potentials but differed considerably in their capacity to induce cell death. In the presence of ascorbate, the cell demise induced by compounds 8-10 was not caspase-3 dependent, as shown by the lack of activation of caspase-3 and the absence of cleaved PARP fragments. In addition, an index of ER stress (eIF2alpha phosphorylation) was activated by these compounds. Quinones 8-10 decreased the cellular capacity to reduce MTT dye and caused marked ATP depletion. Taken together, our results show that ascorbate enhances quinone redox-cycling and leads to ROS formation that inhibits cell proliferation and provokes caspase-independent cell death. Interestingly, we also observed that quinone 8 had a rather selective effect given that freshly isolated peripheral blood leukocytes from human healthy donors were more resistant than human leukemia K562 cells.","['Vasquez, David R', 'Verrax, Julien', 'Valderrama, Jaime A', 'Calderon, Pedro Buc']","['Vasquez DR', 'Verrax J', 'Valderrama JA', 'Calderon PB']","['Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,2011/04/06 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9661-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Jun;30(3):1003-11. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9661-1.

We studied here the molecular interactions between CLL cells and their surrounding stroma to identify factors that help CLL cells to resist apoptosis. Sorted CLL cells from 21 patients were cultured in vitro on allogenous, normal bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in the presence/absence of CD40 ligand or in culture medium alone. Surface and mRNA expression of interaction molecules, cytokine production, and apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometric, real-time PCR and standard immunologic assays. The interaction between CLL cells and BMSCs rescued CLL cells from apoptosis. BMSCs co-cultured with CLL cells showed a strong increase in IL-8 and IL-6 secretion and up-regulated the expression of ICAM-1 and CD40 mRNA. The mRNA expression of CXCL12 and VCAM1 remained unchanged. In turn, CLL cells in interaction with BMSCs significantly up-regulated the expression of CD18 and CD49d that are ligands for the critical adhesion molecules on BMSCs. As a validation of the in vitro data, we found a significant higher expression of CD49d on CLL cells in bone marrow aspirates compared to peripheral blood CLL cells in patient samples. Up-regulation of adhesion molecules and their ligands in CLL-BMSCs interaction along with the increased cytokine production of BMSCs indicate a strong effect of CLL cells on BMSCs in favor of their apoptosis resistance.","['Plander, Mark', 'Ugocsai, Peter', 'Seegers, Silvia', 'Orso, Evelyn', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Schmitz, Gerd', 'Hofstadter, Ferdinand', 'Brockhoff, Gero']","['Plander M', 'Ugocsai P', 'Seegers S', 'Orso E', 'Reichle A', 'Schmitz G', 'Hofstadter F', 'Brockhoff G']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, 93053, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2011/04/06 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1218-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Dec;90(12):1381-90. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1218-z.

As drugs they are most frequently used for immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory purposes. Glucocorticoids are exploited successfully in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases; however, some patients develop side-effects, while others fail to respond to this form of therapy. Alterations in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic actions might contribute to individual differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity. Antibody-based methods such as RIA (Radioimmunoassay) and ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) are routinely used to determine glucocorticoid serum levels. However, as these techniques measure the total amount of a specific glucocorticoid and do not discriminate between protein-bound and freely available (i.e. biologically active) glucocorticoids, the results do not necessarily reflect the active levels of glucocorticoid, i.e. the ""glucocorticoid milieu"" in a patient. Being able to determine glucocorticoid bioactivity in serum or other body fluids could help identifying glucocorticoid-sensitive or -resistant patients and help finding explanations for different responses in individual patients. For this reason, we established a glucocorticoid bioactivity assay that is based on the measurement of glucocorticoid-dependent reporter gene activity. Making use of a human T-cell leukemia line, equipped with the glucocorticoid receptor and the fluorescence protein Venus as the assay's reporter (Jurkat(GR)-MMTV-VNP), glucocorticoid bioactivity can be determined from small amounts of serum or other biologic fluids. The developed glucocorticoid bioassay is both sensitive and reproducible, without any relevant cross-reactivity with steroid hormones other than glucocorticoids and can be practically applied in daily laboratory routine.","['Oppl, Bastian', 'Kofler, Anita', 'Schwarz, Siegfried', 'Rainer, Johannes', 'Kofler, Reinhard']","['Oppl B', 'Kofler A', 'Schwarz S', 'Rainer J', 'Kofler R']","['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00508-011-1562-y [doi]'],ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2011 Apr;123(7-8):222-9. doi: 10.1007/s00508-011-1562-y.

The block to this restriction has never been clearly defined. The original assessment of the inability of gammaretroviruses and gammaretroviral vectors to infect growth-arrested cells was carried out using established cell lines that had been growth-arrested by chemical means, and has been generalized to neurons, which are post-mitotic. We re-examined the capability of gammaretroviruses and their derived vectors to efficiently infect terminally differentiated neuroendocrine cells and primary cortical neurons, a target of both experimental and therapeutic interest. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using GFP expression as a marker for infection, we determined that both growth-arrested (NGF-differentiated) rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) and primary rat cortical neurons could be efficiently transduced, and maintained long-term protein expression, after exposure to murine leukemia virus (MLV) and MLV-based retroviral vectors. Terminally differentiated PC12 cells transduced with a gammaretroviral vector encoding the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL were protected from cell death induced by withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF), demonstrating gammaretroviral vector-mediated delivery and expression of genes at levels sufficient for therapeutic effect in non-dividing cells. Post-mitotic rat cortical neurons were also shown to be susceptible to transduction by murine replication-competent gammaretroviruses and gammaretroviral vectors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that the host range of gammaretroviruses includes post-mitotic and other growth-arrested cells in mammals, and have implications for re-direction of gammaretroviral gene therapy to neurological disease.","['Liu, Xiu-Huai', 'Xu, Wenqin', 'Russ, Jill', 'Eiden, Lee E', 'Eiden, Maribeth V']","['Liu XH', 'Xu W', 'Russ J', 'Eiden LE', 'Eiden MV']","['Section on Molecular Neuroscience, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0018072 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Mar 28;6(3):e18072. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018072.,10.1371/journal.pone.0018072 [doi],20110328,"['0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Gammaretrovirus/drug effects/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Host Specificity/drug effects/*physiology', 'Lentivirus/drug effects/genetics', '*Mitosis/drug effects', 'Nerve Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/*virology', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Serum', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3065480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively reviewed outcomes in 29 children (median age at HSCT, 6.7 y; range, 1.0-16.2 y) with high-risk or advanced AML who underwent allogeneic HSCT at the Asan Medical Center between 1998 and 2008. Donors included a matched sibling donor (MSD) for 7 patients (24%), an unrelated volunteer for 21 patients (72%), and a haploidentical mother for 1 patient (3%). The 3-year estimates of overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) were 77% [95% confidence interval (CI), 65%-99%] and 70% (95% CI, 57%-93%), respectively, whereas the cumulative incidences of relapse and transplant-related mortality were 33% (95% CI, 5%-58%) and 7% (95% CI, 0%-44%), respectively. The 3-year EFS rates did not differ between MSD and AD HSCT. Univariate analysis showed that age >/= 10 years at diagnosis was the only factor associated with poorer EFS. Development of acute graft-versus-host disease predicted a significantly lower incidence of relapse. These findings may provide further evidence that allogeneic HSCT is a curative therapy for children with high-risk or advanced AML, and suggest the efficacy of AD transplantation.","['Koh, Kyung Nam', 'Park, Meerim', 'Kim, Bo Eun', 'Bae, Keun Wook', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Seo, Jong Jin']","['Koh KN', 'Park M', 'Kim BE', 'Bae KW', 'Im HJ', 'Seo JJ']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/07/01 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318203e279 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 May;33(4):281-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318203e279.,10.1097/MPH.0b013e318203e279 [doi],,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Records of 743 neutropenic episodes induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy between 1997 and 2008 were retrospectively reviewed to determine risk factors for and frequency of IFI. The overall frequency of IFI was 0.8% (n=6) and frequencies of proven, probable, and possible infections were 0.3% (n=2), 0.4% (n=3), and 0.1% (n=1), respectively. During 351 episodes of profound neutropenia (neutrophil count <500/muL for >/= 14 d), overall incidence of IFI was 1.71% (n=6). Pulmonary aspergillosis was the most common causative agent, and no patients showed candidemia, or hepatosplenic candidiasis. Cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for acute myelogenous leukemia and profound neutropenia were significantly associated with IFI (P=0.004 and P=0.009, respectively). No IFI-attributable deaths or breakthrough fungal infections occurred. Our results indicate that amphotericin B oral solution and early intravenous fluconazole may be effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of IFI in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Watanabe, Nobuhiro', 'Matsumoto, Kimikazu', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Kato, Koji']","['Watanabe N', 'Matsumoto K', 'Kojima S', 'Kato K']","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan. nobuhiro.watanabe@sch.pref.shizuoka.jp""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/07/01 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31820acfc7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 May;33(4):270-5. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31820acfc7.,10.1097/MPH.0b013e31820acfc7 [doi],,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Aspergillosis/drug therapy/immunology/mortality', '*Candidiasis/drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/immunology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protease was seen to be ATFVLTAATNTLFTA, thus displaying no similarity with the sequences of previously reported metalloproteases. The protease was purified using a procedure that entailed ion-exchange chromatography on CM-Cellulose, Q-Sepharose, and Mono S, and FPLC-gel filtration on Superdex 75. The protease functioned at an optimum pH of 7.0 and an optimum temperature of 50 degrees C. It was also noted that the protease demonstrated a proteolytic activity of 1,756 U/mg toward casein. The Km of the purified protease toward casein was 6.36 mg/ml at a pH of 7.0 and with a temperature of 37 degrees C, whereas the Vmax was 9.11 microgram ml(-1) min(-1). The activity of the protease was adversely affected by EDTA-2Na, suggesting that it is a metalloprotease. PMSF, EGTA, aprotinin, and leupeptin exerted no striking inhibitory effect. The activity of the protease was enhanced by Fe2+, but was curtailed by Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ ions. The protease also exhibited inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 value of 4.00 micrometer. The IC50 values toward hepatoma Hep G2 and leukemia L1210 cells in vitro were 4.99 micrometer and 3.67 micrometer, respectively.","['Wu, Y Y', 'Wang, H X', 'Ng, T B']","['Wu YY', 'Wang HX', 'Ng TB']","['State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology and Department of Microbiology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Microbiol Biotechnol,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,9431852,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['JMB021-03-05 [pii]'],ppublish,J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2011 Mar;21(3):256-62.,,,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Metals)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)']",IM,"['Agaricales/*enzymology', 'Caseins/metabolism', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Enzyme Activators/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Fruiting Bodies, Fungal/enzymology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Metalloproteases/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Metals/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Temperature']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyperleptinaemia also occurs during ALL treatment, but there are no data on long-term alterations to adipocytokines following treatment without CRT. METHODS: Fifty-four survivors (50% female) and 51 controls (59% female) were recruited. Body composition assessment was by BMI, air displacement plethysmography (BODPOD), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and skinfold thickness (SFT). Fasting blood samples were analysed for adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6). RESULTS: The BMI standard deviation score (0.71 vs. 0.04, p < 0.05) and fat percentage measured by BIA (29.8% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.01) and SFT (31.7% vs. 28.2%, p = 0.007) were greater in female survivors compared with controls. Adiposity was similar in male survivors and controls. Absolute leptin (17.8 vs. 7.8 ng/ml, p = 0.01) and fat-adjusted leptin concentrations (p < 0.05) were higher in female survivors compared to controls. Female survivors were less insulin sensitive than controls (p = 0.02). These findings were not observed in males. There were no differences in the other adipocytokines between survivors and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term unfavourable alterations to body composition and adipocyte function are observed in female, but not male, survivors of ALL treatment without CRT.","['Kohler, J A', 'Moon, R J', 'Wright, S', 'Willows, E', 'Davies, J H']","['Kohler JA', 'Moon RJ', 'Wright S', 'Willows E', 'Davies JH']","['Paediatric Oncology and Paediatric Endocrinology, Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Horm Res Paediatr,Hormone research in paediatrics,101525157,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['000324412 [pii]', '10.1159/000324412 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res Paediatr. 2011;75(6):433-40. doi: 10.1159/000324412.

Most deaths occur within the first 2 years after transplantation. In this report, we examine long-term survival in 2-year survivors in the largest cohort ever studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of 10,632 patients worldwide reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research who were alive and disease free 2 years after receiving a myeloablative allogeneic HCT before 2004 for acute myelogenous or lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma, or severe aplastic anemia were reviewed. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9 years, and 3,788 patients had been observed for 10 or more years. The probability of being alive 10 years after HCT was 85%. The chief risk factors for late death included older age and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). For patients who underwent transplantation for malignancy, relapse was the most common cause of death. The greatest risk factor for late relapse was advanced disease at transplantation. Principal risk factors for nonrelapse deaths were older age and GVHD. When compared with age, sex, and nationality-matched general population, late deaths remained higher than expected for each disease, with the possible exception of lymphoma, although the relative risk generally receded over time. CONCLUSION: The prospect for long-term survival is excellent for 2-year survivors of allogeneic HCT. However, life expectancy remains lower than expected. Performance of HCT earlier in the course of disease, control of GVHD, enhancement of immune reconstitution, less toxic regimens, and prevention and early treatment of late complications are needed.","['Wingard, John R', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Brazauskas, Ruta', 'Wang, Zhiwei', 'Sobocinski, Kathleen A', 'Jacobsohn, David', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Bolwell, Brian', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Socie, Gerard']","['Wingard JR', 'Majhail NS', 'Brazauskas R', 'Wang Z', 'Sobocinski KA', 'Jacobsohn D', 'Sorror ML', 'Horowitz MM', 'Bolwell B', 'Rizzo JD', 'Socie G']","['Shands Hospital, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610-0278, USA. wingajr@ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/07/29 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.33.7212 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.33.7212 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 1;29(16):2230-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.33.7212.

In this study, we used genome-wide profiling to compare human T cell ALL samples at the time of diagnosis and after engraftment (xenograft) into immunodeficient recipient mice. Compared with paired diagnosis samples, the xenograft leukemia often contained additional genomic lesions in established human oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes. Mimicking such genomic lesions by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown in diagnosis samples conferred a selective advantage in competitive engraftment experiments, demonstrating that additional lesions can be drivers of increased leukemia-initiating activity. In addition, the xenograft leukemias appeared to arise from minor subclones existing in the patient at diagnosis. Comparison of paired diagnosis and relapse samples showed that, with regard to genetic lesions, xenograft leukemias more frequently more closely resembled relapse samples than bulk diagnosis samples. Moreover, a cell cycle- and mitosis-associated gene expression signature was present in xenograft and relapse samples, and xenograft leukemia exhibited diminished sensitivity to drugs. Thus, the establishment of human leukemia in immunodeficient mice selects and expands a more aggressive malignancy, recapitulating the process of relapse in patients. These findings may contribute to the design of novel strategies to prevent or treat relapse.","['Clappier, Emmanuelle', 'Gerby, Bastien', 'Sigaux, Francois', 'Delord, Marc', 'Touzri, Farah', 'Hernandez, Lucie', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Soulier, Jean']","['Clappier E', 'Gerby B', 'Sigaux F', 'Delord M', 'Touzri F', 'Hernandez L', 'Ballerini P', 'Baruchel A', 'Pflumio F', 'Soulier J']","[""Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Cellules Souches Hematopoietiques et Leucemiques, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, 92265 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/06/11 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20110105 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20110105 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Apr 11;208(4):653-61. doi: 10.1084/jem.20110105.

Using an established mouse model of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), here we report that induction of intracellular Notch1 (ICN1) leads to repression of miR-451 and miR-709. ICN1 decreases expression of these miRNAs by inducing degradation of the E2a tumor suppressor, which transcriptionally activates the genes encoding miR-451 and miR-709. Both miR-451 and miR-709 directly repress Myc expression. In addition, miR-709 directly represses expression of the Akt and Ras-GRF1 oncogenes. We also show that repression of miR-451 and miR-709 expression is required for initiation and maintenance of mouse T-ALL. miR-451 but not miR-709 is conserved in humans, and human T-ALLs with activating NOTCH1 mutations have decreased miR-451 and increased MYC levels compared with T-ALLs with wild-type NOTCH1. Thus, miR-451 and miR-709 function as potent suppressors of oncogenesis in NOTCH1-induced mouse T-ALL, and miR-451 influences MYC expression in human T-ALL bearing NOTCH1 mutations.","['Li, Xiaoyu', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Novina, Carl D', 'von Boehmer, Harald']","['Li X', 'Sanda T', 'Look AT', 'Novina CD', 'von Boehmer H']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/06/11 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20102384 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20102384 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Apr 11;208(4):663-75. doi: 10.1084/jem.20102384.

Exposure of human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells to PG resulted in not only enhanced secretion of CCL2 and CCL4 but also profound induction of their gene transcripts, which were abrogated by oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonosyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine, an inhibitor of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-2/4, but not by polymyxin B.

In this paper, we evaluate the effect that radiotherapy may have had on the subsequent risk of second malignancies, including the possible influences of age at treatment and menopausal status. METHODS: In order to evaluate the long-term consequences of radiotherapy, a cohort study was conducted based on clinical records for 5,248 women treated for breast cancer in Florence (Italy), with continuous follow-up from 1965 to 1994. The Cox proportional hazards model for ungrouped survival data was used to estimate the relative risk for second cancer after radiotherapy. RESULTS: This study indicated an increased relative risk of all second cancers combined following radiotherapy (1.22, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.69). The increased relative risk appeared five or more years after radiotherapy and appeared to be highest amongst women treated after the menopause (1.61, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.29).

The CD4(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) can regulate various immune cells, including B cells, by inducing their apoptosis. Hence, different subgroups of CD4(+) T cells may be involved in the regulation of malignant B cells. In this study, the cytotoxic phenotype and function of various CD4(+) T-cell subgroups were investigated in patients with B-cell malignancies. Peripheral blood was collected from patients with CLL, various B-cell lymphomas, healthy adult donors, children with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B ALL) and from healthy children. CD4(+) T cells (CD3(+) CD4(+) FoxP3(-)), Tregs (CD3(+) CD4(+) CD127(low) FoxP3(+)) and CD127(high) FoxP3(+) T cells (CD3(+) CD4(+) CD127(high) FoxP3(+)) were analysed for their expression of the cytolytic markers CD107a and Fas ligand. Patients with CLL had increased CD107a expression on all tested T-cell subgroups compared with healthy donors. Similar results were found in patients with B-cell lymphomas whereas the CD107a expression in children with pre-B ALL was no different from that in healthy controls. Fas ligand expression was similar between patient cells and cells of healthy donors. CD4(+) T cells and Tregs from patients with CLL and healthy donors were subsequently purified and cultured in vitro with autologous B cells. Both subgroups lysed B cells and killing was confirmed by granzyme ELISAs. In conclusion, cytotoxic populations of CD4(+) T cells, including Tregs, are present in patients with B-cell malignancy and may be an important factor in immune-related disease control.","['Lindqvist, Camilla A', 'Christiansson, Lisa H', 'Thorn, Ingrid', 'Mangsbo, Sara', 'Paul-Wetterberg, Gabriella', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Totterman, Thomas H', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Enblad, Gunilla', 'Frisk, Per', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Loskog, Angelica S I']","['Lindqvist CA', 'Christiansson LH', 'Thorn I', 'Mangsbo S', 'Paul-Wetterberg G', 'Sundstrom C', 'Totterman TH', 'Simonsson B', 'Enblad G', 'Frisk P', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Loskog AS']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2567.2011.03439.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2011 Jul;133(3):296-306. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2011.03439.x.

A systematic evaluation of the immediate and long-term side effects induced by purine analogs reveals that most of the available information relates to fludarabine, and mostly refers to the use of this agent in the treatment of indolent lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) and and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Surprisingly, although purine analogs have been used for more than 30 years in the treatment of HCL, there are still not many reports on the toxicity of pentostatin and cladribine other than the early therapy-induced toxicity encountered in the initial management of patients. Only a few studies have evaluated the long-term adverse effects of purine analogs on the immune system or stem cell toxicity, and most of these are not very recent. In addition, the issue of the prevalence of secondary malignancy linked with the therapy of HCL still remains controversial. In this review the available data on cladribine and pentostatin toxicity in the treatment of HCL are summarized, emphasizing immune suppression, stem cell toxicity, and possible correlation with the development of second malignancy.

Large comparative studies correlating clinical outcome with detection of MRD by immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, and molecular diagnostics are lacking. The presence of normal bone marrow B-lymphocytes and the lack of immunohistochemical stains that are both sensitive and specific can make it challenging to differentiate normal lymphocytes from hairy cells. The use of CD20 and/or DBA.44 immunohistochemical stains, in combination with either tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), CD11c-5D11, or annexin A1, improve specificity and facilitate evaluation. The interobserver concordance in quantifying the percentage of residual hairy cells is poor. Performing cell counts in multiple fields improves reproducibility. The prolonged hematologic remissions of subsets of patients with MRD emphasize the need to define clinically relevant thresholds that correlate with long-term responses and clinical endpoints.

It is licensed for the first- and second-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and second-line treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia on the basis of BCR-ABL inhibition, but the activity of dasatinib against additional molecular targets may enable treatment of other hematologic disorders. Potential targets for dasatinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) include Lyn (a Src family kinase), ABL, and the associated CD40 pathway. Although dasatinib monotherapy has modest clinical activity in CLL, ongoing studies are evaluating combination treatment. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT3, Lyn, c-Kit, and BCR-ABL are expressed in a subpopulation of patients. To date, clinical responses to dasatinib in patients with unselected AML have been mixed and larger studies are needed, particularly correlating clinical response to molecular markers. Imatinib has been used successfully to treat patients with chronic eosinophilic disorders with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase; limited clinical data indicate that dasatinib could be active in imatinib-resistant disease. Ongoing clinical studies should further define the value of dasatinib in these disorders.","['Amrein, Philip C']",['Amrein PC'],"['Hematology-Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA. pamrein@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.555890 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 May;52(5):754-63. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.555890.

However, some patients, otherwise in apparent CR, have evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) as detected by a number of different techniques, including immunohistochemistry, immunophenotypying by flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemistry is readily available, but precise criteria which constitute MRD are not uniform. Immunophenotyping can identify a characteristic immunophenotype, but leukemia cells may be difficult to obtain from a fibrotic bone marrow. Patient-specific PCR, while highly specific, is not readily available. Furthermore, the introduction of newer effective therapies such as the monoclonal antibody rituximab and immunoconjugate BL22 following a purine analog or concurrently with a purine analog may eradicate MRD. However, the optimal method for detecting MRD is not known.

For these patients, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are considered standard of therapy. However, it remains unclear whether BCR/ABL TKIs should be administered lifelong as maintenance post-HSCT, and whether the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) is invariably associated with relapse. We report on two patients with Ph+ ALL who were successfully treated with polychemotherapy and consecutive autologous HSCT. Both patients are in continuous hematologic remission after an observation period of 12 years and 18 years, respectively, despite measurable MRD and although no maintenance therapy was initiated. BCR/ABL transcript-levels ranged between 0.1 and 3% in patient 1, and 0.01 and 0.1% in patient 2 during the observation time. Collectively, these data suggest that not all Ph+ subclones even those that persist after HSCT in Ph+ ALL, may have the potential to cause a hematologic relapse.

The use of flow cytometry, bone marrow examination for minimal residual disease, and peripheral blood counts provides details about the level of disease activity, but the optimal method for following patient response and risk for relapse has not been established. Flow cytometry provides accurate assessments of circulating malignant cell counts even at very low levels, but does not provide details on the extent of bone marrow involvement. Bone marrow involvement can be assessed by biopsy, but is a painful procedure, and the extent of involvement by hairy cell leukemia is not always uniform. Thus, a single biopsy may not identify active disease when it is present. Magnetic resonance imaging is being evaluated as a means for assessing total body burden of disease in the marrow and shows great promise. Tumor markers that can be measured in the serum provide a method for assessing total body disease burden. Cell surface proteins can be shed by tumor cells through proteolytic cleavage to release portions of their extracellular domains. These proteolytic degradation products can be measured in the serum and provide a tool to monitor disease burden and response to therapy. Three cell surface molecules expressed by the malignant hairy cells, CD25, CD22, and CD307, have been used to monitor disease activity and follow patients at risk for relapse. Serum tumor markers provide a reliable, inexpensive, and non-invasive means of following patients with hairy cell leukemia for response to treatment and relapse.","['Janik, John E']",['Janik JE'],"['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. john.janik@bms.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.568651 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52 Suppl 2:69-71. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.568651.

Although their precise mechanisms of action in this disease are still unknown, a number of mechanisms have been postulated. dCF is a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), and treatment results in the accumulation of deoxyadenosine (dAdo) and adenosine (Ado) in the plasma. dAdo is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase in lymphocytes to deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP), which is subsequently converted to deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP). CdA is the chlorinated derivative of deoxyadenosine, is resistant to degradation by ADA, and accumulates in lymphocytes as CdATP. Both dATP and CdATP cause an initial accumulation of DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes and this results in the activation of p53, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and apoptosis. CdA has several unique mechanisms of action over dAdo and these include the incorportation of CdATP into DNA, the inhibition of DNA polymerase beta, and the phosphorylation of CdA to CdATP by deoxyguanosine kinase in mitochondria. These additional modes of action produce further DNA breaks in CdA-treated cells and explain the more potent activity of CdA compared to dCF and the greater myelosuppression with this agent. The cells die by apoptosis, but the DNA strand breaks also cause the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), with resultant cellular depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP. The induction of necrosis by PARP activation may explain the activity of these analogs in some patients with p53 mutations.","['Johnston, James B']",['Johnston JB'],"['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. james.johnston@cancercare.mb.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2011/04/06 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.570394 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52 Suppl 2:43-5. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.570394.

The t(11;14) MCL translocation is identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and can distinguish the two disorders. We attempted to identify flow cytometric and other markers predictive of a positive FISH test. METHODS: We examined 100 atypical CLL/MCL cases for demographic, hematological, and cytometric variables, 96 were FISH tested for t(11;14) and four were known MCL. RESULTS: Twenty-two cases were confirmed as MCL. Multivariate analysis identified four variables associated with MCL: thrombocytopenia (taken as Plt < 150 x 10(9)/L), CD23 negative, CD20 strong, and CD38 positive, with these variables a four-point score was devised. By ROC analysis, the MCL score was superior in differentiating MCL to the Marsden CLL score (AUC 0.95 vs. 0.78). MCL score >/= 2 showed sensitivity 1, specificity 0.66, positive predictive value (PPV) 0.49, and negative predictive value (NPV) 1 for MCL. The score was then prospectively validated on an independent cohort of 44 cases of atypical CLL/MCL. No MCL had a score < 3. Validation PPV/NPV of score >/= 3 were 0.5/1. Overall survival in MCL was shorter compared to t(11;14) negative patients (median 3.3 vs. 4.2 years, HR 2.2, 95% CI 0.87-5.5, P = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: The score described can be used to identify cases of CD5/19 positive lymphoproliferative disorders likely to be t(11;14) positive MCL.","['Medd, Patrick G', 'Clark, Nithiya', 'Leyden, Kevin', 'Turner, Susan', 'Strefford, Jennifer A', 'Butler, Caroline', 'Collins, Graham P', 'Roberts, David J', 'Atoyebi, Wale', 'Hatton, Chris S R']","['Medd PG', 'Clark N', 'Leyden K', 'Turner S', 'Strefford JA', 'Butler C', 'Collins GP', 'Roberts DJ', 'Atoyebi W', 'Hatton CS']","['Department of Haematology, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford OX39DU, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

METHODS: Sixty-five cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and 50 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were detected by FISH with DCDF probe, the BCR/ABL positive samples were detected by FISH with ES probe. Among these cases, 47 cases of CML and 40 cases of ALL perform conventional cytogenetics simultaneously. RESULTS: All 65 cases of CML were all BCR/ABL positive by FISH. 17 cases showed the atypical pattern by DCDF-FISH, and 12 cases showed the atypical pattern by ES-FISH. There were 7 cases of BCR/ABL positive in 50 cases of ALL by FISH. By ES-FISH, there were 5 cases in which the break-point of BCR gene was located in m-bcr, 2 cases in which the break-point of BCR gene was located in M-bcr. Conventional cytogenetics demonstrated that 43/44(98%) cases of CML and 7/32(22%) cases of ALL were Ph positive. CONCLUSION: The features of DCDF-FISH, ES-FISH and conventional cytogenetic are different from each other. According to the features of these method, it can increase the precision of the adjustment of genetic feature to analyze these results comprehensively.","['DU, Qing-hua', 'YING, Yi', 'CHEN, Xiao-yan', 'LI, Qing-shan', 'WANG, Shun-qing', 'MO, Wen-jian']","['DU QH', 'YING Y', 'CHEN XY', 'LI QS', 'WANG SQ', 'MO WJ']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First Municipal People's Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510180 P.

The objective of this study was to examine the integration of sports activity into pediatric PBSCT and to indicate attainable results. This 2-step case-control-study included 23 children and adolescents from the PBSCT: During the isolation phase 13 patients trained 3 times per week on a cycle ergometer and passed a course with different sports equipment. Apart from recording physiologic adaptations, quality of live was inquired in a pre-post design using questionnaires. Guided interviews according to necessity and requirements for sports activity at the PBSCT unit completed the evaluation and were used for the intervention as well as for the control group (n = 10) without sports therapy. On the ergometer, patients trained average 25 min with 0.6 watt / kg. In the majority, a loss of muscular power could be avoided. Quality of life and fatigue symptoms improved by trend. Interview analysis showed general acceptance of physical activity during PBSCT. After initial skepticism due to the additional burden, our implementation study showed the feasibility of supportive sports therapy in PBSCT. Quality and flexibility of the equipment should be higher than normal and different physical and psychological conditions of the patients should be anticipated and integrated into the training program.","['Rosenhagen, A', 'Bernhorster, M', 'Vogt, L', 'Weiss, B', 'Senn, A', 'Arndt, S', 'Siegler, K', 'Jung, M', 'Bader, P', 'Banzer, W']","['Rosenhagen A', 'Bernhorster M', 'Vogt L', 'Weiss B', 'Senn A', 'Arndt S', 'Siegler K', 'Jung M', 'Bader P', 'Banzer W']","['Sports Medicine, University of Frankfurt, Germany.

We have examined the potential of flavonoids to affect the accumulation and cytotoxicity of 3 cytotoxic drugs [vinblastine (VLB), daunorubicin (DNR), and colchicine (COL)] that are substrates for the ABC transporter, P-glycoprotein in a vinblastine-resistant T-cell leukemia, CEM/VBL(100), that overexpresses P-glycoprotein. The effects of the flavonoids on accumulation and cytotoxicity of these drugs were different depending on the P-gp substrate used. Most of the 30 flavonoids tested decreased DNR accumulation in the VBL-resistant, but not sensitive, leukemia cells. By contrast, flavonoids that inhibited DNR accumulation enhanced the accumulation of fluorescently labeled vinblastine. None of these flavonoids affected COL accumulation. The effects of the flavonoids on the cytotoxicities of these drugs paralleled their effects on accumulation; the same flavonoids decreased DNR cytotoxicity but increased VLB cytotoxicity and had no effect on COL. Verapamil reversed the accumulation deficit and cytotoxicity of all three P-gp substrates. These effects correlated with the effects of flavonoids on P-gp-ATPase activity. Flavonoids that decreased DNR accumulation stimulated DNR-activated P-gp ATPase, whereas flavonoids that increased fluorescently labeled VLB accumulation inhibited VBL-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity, thereby accounting for the decrease or increase in cancer drug accumulation in resistant cells. We conclude that flavonoids often ingested by cancer patients may have different effects on anticancer drugs and that these findings should be considered in designing future combination treatments for cancer patients.","['Tran, Van H', 'Marks, Denese', 'Duke, Rujee K', 'Bebawy, Mary', 'Duke, Colin C', 'Roufogalis, Basil D']","['Tran VH', 'Marks D', 'Duke RK', 'Bebawy M', 'Duke CC', 'Roufogalis BD']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['935797991 [pii]', '10.1080/01635581.2011.535959 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2011;63(3):435-43. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2011.535959.,10.1080/01635581.2011.535959 [doi],,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/*metabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', '*Herb-Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the outcome of ATRA/anthracycline chemotherapy and clinicobiological correlations of FLT3/ITD and NPM1 mutations in APL patients. METHODS: Induction therapy included oral ATRA (45 mg/m(2)/day) and idarubicin (12 mg/m(2)/day, intravenous, on days 2, 4, and 6). Patients achieving complete remission (CR) received 3 courses of ATRA combined with reinforced consolidation therapy. Mutations were analyzed using GeneScan and polymerasae chain reaction assays of bone marrow samples obtained from patients at diagnosis. RESULTS: Forty-five (84.9%) of 53 eligible patients achieved CR. The overall relapse rate was 8.9%, and the 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 84.9+/-4.9% and 77.5+/-6.0%, respectively. The NPM1 mutation was not found in any patient, while the FLT3/ITD mutation was found in 10 (20.0%) patients. Of the FLT3/ITD+ patients, 80% belonged to the high-risk group, defined according to the presenting WBC and platelet counts. Among the patients who achieved CR, those who were FLT3/ITD+ had a higher relapse rate than those FLT3/ITD-. FLT3/ITD+ patients also had a significantly lower 3-year LFS than FLT3/ITD- patients. Multivariate analysis of the LFS showed that the FLT3/ITD mutation was independently associated with a shorter overall LFS, after adjusting for pretreatment risk stratification. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the clinical outcome of newly diagnosed APL patients treated with ATRA/anthracycline chemotherapy. Patients carrying the FLT3/ITD mutation had more aggressive clinical features and a poorer clinical outcome.","['Hong, Seung-Dok', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Kim, Hee-Nam', 'Lee, Se Ryeon', 'Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Lee, Je-Jung', 'Lee, Il-Kwon', 'Shin, Myung-Geun', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon']","['Hong SD', 'Kim YK', 'Kim HN', 'Lee SR', 'Ahn JS', 'Yang DH', 'Lee JJ', 'Lee IK', 'Shin MG', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/04/05 06:01,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2011.46.1.24 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2011 Mar;46(1):24-30. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2011.46.1.24.

New agents to treat ALL are urgently required. FTY720 is an immunosuppressive drug that has promising in vitro activity in a number of malignancies, with the proposed mechanism being the reactivation of the protein serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A. FTY720 reduced the proliferation and viability of Ph(+) and Ph(-) ALL cell lines and patient samples with IC 50 values for viability between 5.3 to 7.9 muM. Cell death was caspase-independent with negligible activation of caspase-3 and no inhibition of FTY720-induced cell death by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. The cytotoxic effects of FTY720 were independent of PP2A reactivation as determined by the lack of effect of the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid. Features of autophagy, including autophagosomes, LC3II expression and increased autophagic flux, were induced by FTY720. However the phosphorylated form of FTY720 (FTY720-P) similarly induced autophagy but not cell death. This suggests that autophagy is prosurvival in this setting, a finding supported by protection from cell death induced by the cytotoxic agent vincristine. FTY720 also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) partially reversed the cytotoxic effects, demonstrating a role for ROS generation in the cell death mechanism. FTY720 is an active drug in vitro in ALL cell lines and patient samples. Evidence supports a caspase-independent mechanism of cell death with the occurrence of autophagy and necrosis.","['Wallington-Beddoe, Craig T', 'Hewson, John', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Wallington-Beddoe CT', 'Hewson J', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['15154 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.7.7.15154 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2011 Jul;7(7):707-15. doi: 10.4161/auto.7.7.15154.

However, there is conflicting data on the superiority of one regimen over the other. Our aim was to critically appraise and synthesize available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CYTBI compared to BUCY as a conditioning regimen. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BUCY with CYTBI. METHODS: We did a systematic search of the indexed medical literature using appropriate keywords to identify potentially relevant articles. The primary outcome of interest was efficacy measured by overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Acute and late toxicity were secondary endpoints. Meta-analysis was attempted only on RCTs. A relative risk or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each outcome in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen non-randomized comparative studies involving 6280 patients were included in a narrative review without attempting a pooled analysis, in view of the potential for significant bias. Outcome data from seven RCTs involving 730 patients randomly assigned to either CYTBI or BUCY was pooled using meta-analytic methods. CYTBI was associated with a modest but non-significant reduction in all cause mortality (RR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.64-1.05; P=.12) and relapse of leukemia (RR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.72-1.10; P=.28). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly lesser with CYTBI compared to oral BUCY (RR-0.53, 95%CI: 0.31-0.90; P=.02). The cumulative incidence of major complications was not significantly different between the two regimens, but specific complications varied according to the conditioning regimen. TBI-based regimens were associated with more severe late effects on growth and development in children. CONCLUSION: This analysis represents the largest comparative analyses of CYTBI with BUCY as a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in the indexed medical literature. Conditioning regimen and disease (type and setting) can significantly affect outcomes. TRM is significantly lesser with CYTBI, but this does not translate into a significant survival benefit. There remain valid concerns regarding the late effects of TBI, particularly in children. Although not overly superior, the weight of evidence favors CYTBI over BUCY as a first choice-conditioning regimen in patients with leukemia.","['Gupta, T', 'Kannan, S', 'Dantkale, V', 'Laskar, S']","['Gupta T', 'Kannan S', 'Dantkale V', 'Laskar S']","['Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.5144/1658-3876.2011.17 [pii]', '10.5144/1658-3876.2011.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2011;4(1):17-29. doi: 10.5144/1658-3876.2011.17.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Databases as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Registries', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accessible, reliable, and informative cancer biomarkers can be medically valuable and can provide some relevant insights into cancer biology. Recent studies have suggested improvements in detecting malignancies by the use of specific extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable hematologic disorder, sensitive, early, and noninvasive diagnosis and better disease classification would be very useful for more effective therapies. We show here that circulating miRNAs can be sensitive biomarkers for CLL, because certain extracellular miRNAs are present in CLL patient plasma at levels significantly different from healthy controls and from patients affected by other hematologic malignancies. The levels of several of these circulating miRNAs also displayed significant differences between zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70)(+) and ZAP-70(-) CLL. We also determined that the level of circulating miR-20a correlates reliably with diagnosis-to-treatment time. Network analysis of our data, suggests a regulatory network associated with BCL2 and ZAP-70 expression in CLL. This hypothesis suggests the possibility of using the levels of specific miRNAs in plasma to detect CLL and to determine the ZAP-70 status.","['Moussay, Etienne', 'Wang, Kai', 'Cho, Ji-Hoon', 'van Moer, Kris', 'Pierson, Sandrine', 'Paggetti, Jerome', 'Nazarov, Petr V', 'Palissot, Valerie', 'Hood, Leroy E', 'Berchem, Guy', 'Galas, David J']","['Moussay E', 'Wang K', 'Cho JH', 'van Moer K', 'Pierson S', 'Paggetti J', 'Nazarov PV', 'Palissot V', 'Hood LE', 'Berchem G', 'Galas DJ']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Centre de Recherche Public-Sante, L-1526 Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/06/18 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1019557108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1019557108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Apr 19;108(16):6573-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1019557108.

Increased genomic instability, deregulated proliferation, and loss of differentiation appear associated to BC, but the molecular alterations underlying the progression of CML are poorly characterized. MYC oncogene is frequently deregulated in human cancer, often associated with tumor progression. Genomic instability and induction of aberrant DNA replication are described as effects of MYC. In this report, we studied MYC activities in CML cell lines with conditional MYC expression with and without exposure to imatinib, the front-line drug in CML therapy. In cells with conditional MYC expression, MYC did not rescue the proliferation arrest mediated by imatinib but provoked aberrant DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells with 4C content. We studied MYC mRNA expression in 66 CML patients at different phases of the disease, and we found that MYC expression was higher in CML patients at diagnosis than control bone marrows or in patients responding to imatinib. Further, high MYC levels at diagnosis correlated with a poor response to imatinib. MYC expression did not directly correlate with BCR-ABL levels in patients treated with imatinib. Overall our study suggests that, as in other tumor models, MYC-induced aberrant DNA synthesis in CML cells is consistent with MYC overexpression in untreated CML patients and nonresponding patients and supports a role for MYC in CML progression, possibly through promotion of genomic instability.","['Albajar, Marta', 'Gomez-Casares, M Teresa', 'Llorca, Javier', 'Mauleon, Itsaso', 'Vaque, Jose P', 'Acosta, Juan C', 'Bermudez, Arancha', 'Donato, Nicholas', 'Delgado, M Dolores', 'Leon, Javier']","['Albajar M', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Llorca J', 'Mauleon I', 'Vaque JP', 'Acosta JC', 'Bermudez A', 'Donato N', 'Delgado MD', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Avda Cardenal Herrera Oria s/n, 39011 Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0356 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0356 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 May;9(5):564-76. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0356.

The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein and its Drosophila homolog, Trithorax, which exist within COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1)-like complexes, are master regulators of development. They are required for proper homeotic gene expression, in part through methylation of histone H3 on Lys 4. In humans, the MLL gene is involved in a large number of chromosomal translocations that create chimeric proteins, fusing the N terminus of MLL to several proteins that share little sequence similarity. Several frequent translocation partners of MLL were found recently to coexist in a super elongation complex (SEC) that includes known transcription elongation factors such as eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) and P-TEFb. Importantly, the SEC is required for HOX gene expression in leukemic cells, suggesting that chromosomal translocations involving MLL could lead to the overexpression of HOX and other genes through the involvement of the SEC. Here, we review the normal developmental roles of MLL and the SEC, and how MLL fusion proteins can mediate leukemogenesis.","['Smith, Edwin', 'Lin, Chengqi', 'Shilatifard, Ali']","['Smith E', 'Lin C', 'Shilatifard A']","['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri 64110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['25/7/661 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.2015411 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2011 Apr 1;25(7):661-72. doi: 10.1101/gad.2015411.,10.1101/gad.2015411 [doi],,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth and Development/genetics/*physiology', 'HIV Infections/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism']","['R01 CA089455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA89455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM069905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA150265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA150265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3070929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To substantiate evidence for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in first complete remission in these high-risk patients we performed a landmark analysis within a single prospective multicenter treatment trial. DESIGN AND METHODS: By the time of analysis, 2,347 patients had been accrued into the AMLCG 99 trial between 1999 - 2007. Out of this population, 243 patients under 60 years old fulfilled the criteria for high-risk cytogenetics. Landmark analyses were performed with a control cohort, who remained in first complete remission at least the median time from complete remission to transplantation in the intervention group. RESULTS: After standardized induction therapy, 111 patients under 60 years old achieved complete remission. A matched allogeneic donor was identified for 59 patients (30 sibling donors, 29 unrelated donors). Fifty-five patients received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant after a median time of 88 days in first complete remission. Of the remaining 56 patients, 21 relapsed within 90 days after achieving first complete remission and for 7 patients with relevant comorbidities no donors search was initiated, leaving 28 patients given conventional post-remission therapy as the control cohort. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 60.4 months. Patients with an allogeneic donor had substantially better 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rates than the control group (48% versus 18%, P=0.004 and 39% versus 10%, P<0.001, respectively). A survival benefit from transplantation was evident regardless of donor type, age and monosomal karyotype. Conclusions Beyond evidence available for subgroups of high-risk patients, the findings of this study establish in a broader manner that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a preferable consolidation treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk cytogenetics.

To date most association studies of acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been based on the candidate gene approach and have evaluated a restricted number of polymorphisms. Such studies have served to highlight difficulties in conducting statistically and methodologically rigorous investigations into acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk. Recent genome-wide association studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia have provided robust evidence that common variation at four genetic loci confers a modest increase in risk. The accumulated experience to date and relative lack of success of initial efforts to identify novel acute lymphoblastic leukemia predisposition loci emphasize the need for alternative study designs and methods. The International Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Genetics Consortium includes 12 research groups in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas engaged in studying the genetics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The initial goal of this consortium is to identify and characterize low-penetrance susceptibility variants for acute lymphoblastic leukemia through association-based analyses. Efforts to develop genome-wide association studies of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in terms of both sample size and single nucleotide polymorphism coverage, and to increase the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms taken forward to large-scale replication should lead to the identification of additional novel risk variants for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Ethnic differences in the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are well recognized and thus in assessing the interplay between inherited and non-genetic risk factors, analyses using different population cohorts with different incidence rates are likely to be highly informative. Given that the frequency of many acute lymphoblastic leukemia subgroups is small, identifying differential effects will realistically only be possible through multi-center pooled analyses. Here, we review the rationale for identifying genetic risk variants for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and our proposed strategy for establishing the International Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Genetics Consortium.","['Sherborne, Amy L', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Kumar, Rajiv', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Petridou, Eleni', 'Semsei, Agnes F', 'Szalai, Csaba', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Lanciotti, Marina', 'Dufour, Carlo', 'Indaco, Stefania', 'El-Ghouroury, Eman A', 'Sawangpanich, Ruchchadol', 'Hongeng, Suradej', 'Pakakasama, Samart', 'Gonzalez-Neira, Anna', 'Ugarte, Evelia L', 'Leal, Valeria P', 'Espinoza, Juan P M', 'Kamel, Azza M', 'Ebid, Gamal T A', 'Radwan, Eman R', 'Yalin, Serap', 'Yalin, Erdinc', 'Berkoz, Mehmet', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Roman, Eve', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Hosking, Fay J', 'Vijayakrishnan, Jayaram', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Houlston, Richard S']","['Sherborne AL', 'Hemminki K', 'Kumar R', 'Bartram CR', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M', 'Petridou E', 'Semsei AF', 'Szalai C', 'Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M', 'Healy J', 'Lanciotti M', 'Dufour C', 'Indaco S', 'El-Ghouroury EA', 'Sawangpanich R', 'Hongeng S', 'Pakakasama S', 'Gonzalez-Neira A', 'Ugarte EL', 'Leal VP', 'Espinoza JP', 'Kamel AM', 'Ebid GT', 'Radwan ER', 'Yalin S', 'Yalin E', 'Berkoz M', 'Simpson J', 'Roman E', 'Lightfoot T', 'Hosking FJ', 'Vijayakrishnan J', 'Greaves M', 'Houlston RS']","['Section of Cancer Genetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/10/27 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.040121 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.040121 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Jul;96(7):1049-54. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.040121.

DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2006, the Acute Leukemia French Association group ran two concurrent randomized trials with overlapping inclusion criteria for patients aged 65 to 70 with acute myeloid leukemia, with different post-remission strategies: two intensive courses in the 9801 trial, one intensive course or six outpatient courses in the 9803 trial. We analyzed the outcome of these patients per protocol and per post-remission therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred and eleven patients aged 65 to 70 years with de novo acute myeloid leukemia were enrolled in trial 9801 (n=76) or 9803 (n=135). The patients in the two trials had comparable white blood cell counts (P=0.3), cytogenetics (P=0.49), and complete remission rates (70% and 57%, respectively; P=0.17). Overall survival was identical in both trials (32% and 34% at 2 years, respectively; P=0.71). Overall survival after complete remission was identical in the 103 of 130 patients who received the planned post-remission courses (n=44 with two intensive courses, n=28 with one intensive course, n=31 with six outpatient courses; 41%, 55%, and 58% at 2 years, respectively; P=0.34). Even in patients with favorable or normal karyotype (n=97), overall survival from complete remission was not improved by more intensive post-remission therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients aged 65 to 70 years with de novo acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission after standard intensive induction chemotherapy, there is no apparent benefit from intensive post-remission therapy.

In T-lymphocytes, aberrant LMO2 expression beyond those stages leads to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while in B cells LMO2 is also expressed in germinal center lymphocytes and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, where it predicts better clinical outcome. The implication of LMO2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia must still be explored. DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured LMO2 expression by real time RT-PCR in 247 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples with cytogenetic data (144 of them also with survival and immunophenotypical data) and in normal hematopoietic and lymphoid cells. RESULTS: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases expressed variable levels of LMO2 depending on immunophenotypical and cytogenetic features. Thus, the most immature subtype, pro-B cells, displayed three-fold higher LMO2 expression than pre-B cells, common-CD10+ or mature subtypes. Additionally, cases with TEL-AML1 or MLL rearrangements exhibited two-fold higher LMO2 expression compared to cases with BCR-ABL rearrangements or hyperdyploid karyotype. Clinically, high LMO2 expression correlated with better overall survival in adult patients (5-year survival rate 64.8% (42.5%-87.1%) vs. 25.8% (10.9%-40.7%), P= 0.001) and constituted a favorable independent prognostic factor in B-ALL with normal karyotype: 5-year survival rate 80.3% (66.4%-94.2%) vs. 63.0% (46.1%-79.9%) (P= 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that LMO2 expression depends on the molecular features and the differentiation stage of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Furthermore, assessment of LMO2 expression in adult patients with a normal karyotype, a group which lacks molecular prognostic factors, could be of clinical relevance.","['Malumbres, Raquel', 'Fresquet, Vicente', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Bobadilla, Miriam', 'Robles, Eloy F', 'Altobelli, Giovanna G', 'Calasanz, M Jose', 'Smeland, Erlend B', 'Aznar, Maria Angela', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Martin-Palanco, Vanesa', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Lossos, Izidore S', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose A']","['Malumbres R', 'Fresquet V', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Bobadilla M', 'Robles EF', 'Altobelli GG', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Smeland EB', 'Aznar MA', 'Agirre X', 'Martin-Palanco V', 'Prosper F', 'Lossos IS', 'Martinez-Climent JA']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA) University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/10/27 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.040568 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.040568 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Jul;96(7):980-6. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.040568.

Nutlin-3a is currently under pre-clinical investigation in a variety of solid tumor and leukemia models as a p53 reactivation agent, and has been recently demonstrated to also have p53 independent actions in cancer cells. In the present study, we first report that nutlin-3a can inhibit the efflux function of BCRP. We observed that although the nutlin-3a IC(50) did not differ between BCRP over-expressing and vector control cells, nutlin-3a treatment significantly potentiated the cells to treatment with the BCRP substrate mitoxantrone. Combination index calculations suggested synergism between nutlin-3a and mitoxantrone in cell lines over-expressing BCRP. Upon further investigation, it was confirmed that nutlin-3a increased the intracellular accumulation of BCRP substrates such as mitoxantrone and Hoechst 33342 in cells expressing functional BCRP without altering the expression level or localization of BCRP. Interestingly, nutlin-3b, considered virtually ""inactive"" in disrupting the MDM2/p53 interaction, reversed Hoechst 33342 efflux with the same potency as nutlin-3a. Intracellular accumulation and bi-directional transport studies using MDCKII cells suggested that nutlin-3a is not a substrate of BCRP. Additionally, an ATPase assay using Sf9 insect cell membranes over-expressing wild-type BCRP indicated that nutlin-3a inhibits BCRP ATPase activity in a dose-dependent fashion. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that nutlin-3a inhibits BCRP efflux function, which consequently reverses BCRP-related drug resistance.","['Zhang, Fan', 'Throm, Stacy L', 'Murley, Laura L', 'Miller, Laura A', 'Steven Zatechka, D Jr', 'Kiplin Guy, R', 'Kennedy, Rachel', 'Stewart, Clinton F']","['Zhang F', 'Throm SL', 'Murley LL', 'Miller LA', 'Steven Zatechka D Jr', 'Kiplin Guy R', 'Kennedy R', 'Stewart CF']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. fan.zhang@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00211-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Jul 1;82(1):24-34. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.03.024.

By combining optimized fluorescence-coupled miR30-based shRNAs with high efficiency ES cell targeting, we developed a fast, scalable pipeline for the production of shRNA transgenic mice. Using this system, we generated eight tet-regulated shRNA transgenic lines targeting Firefly and Renilla luciferases, Oct4 and tumor suppressors p53, p16(INK4a), p19(ARF) and APC and demonstrate potent gene silencing and GFP-tracked knockdown in a broad range of tissues in vivo. Further, using an shRNA targeting APC, we illustrate how this approach can identify predicted phenotypes and also unknown functions for a well-studied gene. In addition, through regulated gene silencing we validate APC/Wnt and p19(ARF) as potential therapeutic targets in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and lung adenocarcinoma, respectively.

Although it functions, like phorbol esters, as a potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator, it paradoxically antagonizes many phorbol ester responses in cells. Because of its complex structure, little is known of its structure-function relations. Merle 23 is a synthetic derivative, differing from bryostatin 1 at only four positions. However, in U-937 human leukemia cells, Merle 23 behaves like a phorbol ester and not like bryostatin 1. Here, we characterize the behavior of Merle 23 in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. In this system, bryostatin 1 and phorbol ester have contrasting activities, with the phorbol ester but not bryostatin 1 blocking cell proliferation or tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion, among other responses. We show that Merle 23 displays a highly complex pattern of activity in this system. Depending on the specific biological response or mechanistic change, it was bryostatin-like, phorbol ester-like, intermediate in its behavior, or more effective than either.

Dysregulation of hCLP46 occurs in many hematologic diseases, but the role of hCLP46 remains unclear. Knockdown of hCLP46 by RNA interference resulted in decreased protein levels of endogenous Notch1, Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Notch target gene Hes-1, suggesting the impairment of the Notch signaling. However, neither cell surface Notch expression nor ligand binding activities were affected. In addition, down-regulated expression of hCLP46 inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells, which was correlated with increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) CDKN1B (p27) and decreased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein. We showed that lack of hCLP46 results in impaired ligand induced Notch activation in mammalian cell, and hCLP46 regulates the proliferation of U937 cell through CDKI-RB signaling pathway, which may be important for the pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Ma, Wenzhan', 'Du, Jie', 'Chu, Qiaoyun', 'Wang, Youxin', 'Liu, Lixin', 'Song, Manshu', 'Wang, Wei']","['Ma W', 'Du J', 'Chu Q', 'Wang Y', 'Liu L', 'Song M', 'Wang W']","['College of Life Science, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/07/22 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)00536-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.124 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Apr 29;408(1):84-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.124.

In human promyelocytic leukemia ATRA reduces the expression of cellular procoagulant activities (PCA), i.e. tissue factor (TF) and cancer procoagulant (CP). There are no studies on the effects of ATRA on the PCA of solid tumors, i.e. breast cancer cells. We analyzed different human breast cancer cell lines in order to: 1. characterize the expression of TF and CP; 2. evaluate whether these activities are affected by ATRA; and 3. verify whether a reduction in tumor cell procoagulants may occur in association to apoptosis and growth inhibition induced by ATRA. Two estrogen receptor positive (ER-positive; i.e. MCF7 and ZR75.1) and one estrogen receptor negative (ER-negative; i.e. MDA.MB.231) cell lines were included into the study. The results show that ATRA affected TF in a dose-dependent fashion only in ER-positive cell lines. In particular, at 1 uM ATRA, TF significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by 57%, 44% in MCF7, ZR75.1 cells, respectively. Differently the results show that ATRA dose-dependently affected CP expression in all three cell lines. Specifically, at 1 uM ATRA, CP significantly decreased by 44%, 50% and 25% in MCF7, ZR75.1, and MDA.MB.231. Only in ER-positive cell lines, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth that became statistically significant at 1 uM ATRA, which was associated to a slight but significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that ATRA downregulates the expression of TF and CP in breast cancer cells. Due to the pivotal role of coagulation activation in tumor progression, the capacity of ATRA to affect also tumor procoagulants, in parallel to cell apoptosis, open new perspectives in tumor therapy.","['Marchetti, Marina', 'Russo, Laura', 'Balducci, Donatella', 'Falanga, Anna']","['Marchetti M', 'Russo L', 'Balducci D', 'Falanga A']","['Division of Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Oncology-Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy. marina.r.marchetti@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,2011/04/05 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-3848(11)00119-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2011.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2011 Oct;128(4):368-74. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2011.03.006.

To investigate whether this polymorphism functions as a modifier of breast cancer development, we analyzed the distribution of genotype frequency, as well as the association of genotype with clinicopathological characteristics. Furthermore, we also studied the effects of this SNP on Bcl-2 expression in vitro. METHODS: We genotyped the BCL-2 (-938C > A) in 114 patients and 107 controls, and analyzed the estrogen receptor (ER), progestogen receptor (PR), C-erbB2 and Ki67 status with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Different Bcl-2 protein levels in breast cancer cell lines were determined using western blot. Logistic regression model was applied in statistical analysis. RESULTS: We found that homozygous AA genotype was associated with an increased risk (AA vs AC+CC) by 2.37-fold for breast cancer development and significant association was observed between nodal status and different genotypes of BCL-2 (-938C > A) (p = 0.014). AA genotype was more likely to develop into lobular breast cancer (p = 0.036). The result of western blot analysis indicated that allele A was associated with the lower level of Bcl-2 expression in breast cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: AA genotype of BCL-2 (-938C > A) is associated with susceptibility of breast cancer, and this genotype is only associated with the nodal status and pathological diagnosis of breast cancer. The polymorphism has an effect on Bcl-2 expression but needs further investigation.","['Zhang, Ning', 'Li, Xiaoyan', 'Tao, Kai', 'Jiang, Liyu', 'Ma, Tingting', 'Yan, Shi', 'Yuan, Cunzhong', 'Moran, Meena S', 'Liang, Faming', 'Haffty, Bruce G', 'Yang, Qifeng']","['Zhang N', 'Li X', 'Tao K', 'Jiang L', 'Ma T', 'Yan S', 'Yuan C', 'Moran MS', 'Liang F', 'Haffty BG', 'Yang Q']","[""Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, School of Medicine, Ji'nan, PR China. qifengy@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/06/11 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2350-12-48 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2350-12-48 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2011 Apr 1;12:48. doi: 10.1186/1471-2350-12-48.,10.1186/1471-2350-12-48 [doi],20110401,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alanine', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",,PMC3078853,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis that on chromosome 22 the immunoglobulin light chain lambda (IGL) is involved in this cytogenetic aberration. Additionally, we demonstrate the resulting overexpression of CCND1 on the RNA and protein level, thereby consolidating the new diagnosis of a MCL-like B-cell neoplasia. Summing up, we described a rare case of t(11;22)(q13;q11.2) in a MCL-like neoplasia and showed that this aberration leads to an overexpression of CCND1 which is regarded as a key biological feature in MCL.

We found the complex to be cytotoxic to all of the tested cells, with a 46-fold difference between the most sensitive and the least sensitive cell type. Oleic acid by itself exhibited a remarkably similar activity. The cell-killing mechanisms of the complex and of oleic acid alone were examined by flow cytometry, testing for apoptosis- and necrosis- inducing activity. The T-cell leukemia-derived Jurkat cells primarily underwent cell death resembling apoptosis, whereas the monocytic leukemia-derived THP1 cells adopted a more necrotic-like cell death.

Limited data are available on familial mortality in melanoma. If fatal forms of melanoma were associated with fatal forms of melanoma or of some other cancers, only studies on familial mortality rather than on familial incidence might be able to detect them. Furthermore, estimates on familial aggregation based on mortality are free from bias of overdiagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the estimation of familial aggregation of concordant melanoma and of melanoma and any other cancers based both on incidence and on mortality. METHODS: We used the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for incident melanoma for relatives of any cancer patients and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for death from melanoma for relatives of individuals who died from any other cancer. Similar risks were determined for any common cancer when relatives were affected by melanoma. RESULTS: For concordant melanoma, familial incidence equalled familial mortality, SIR=SMR. Familial clustering (SIRs increased) of melanoma and oesophageal, colorectal, breast, prostate, kidney, nervous system and connective tissue cancers and myeloma and leukaemia was observed. The SMRs for pancreatic and nervous system cancers were increased in relatives whose parents had died from melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: These data should encourage a search for fatal subtypes of familial cancer, which may eventually have clinical implications.","['Brandt, A', 'Sundquist, J', 'Hemminki, K']","['Brandt A', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2133.2011.10350.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2011 Aug;165(2):342-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2011.10350.x.

Among them, photodynamic therapy (PDT) might be a promising modality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the purging efficacy of ex vivo PDT on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: A new amphiphilic mono-alpha-substituted zinc (II) phthalocyanine (ZnPcH(1)) was used as a PDT photosensitizer. Nest reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR of BCR/ABL1 fusion gene remained positive were performed to determine the purging effects of ZnPcH(1)-PDT on the mixture of CML cell line K562 cells and normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and on the CML cells from the bone marrow of patients with CML who had achieved complete hematology remission but whose BCR/ABL1 fusion genes remained positive. RESULTS: CML cells exhibited higher susceptibility to ZnPcH(1)-PDT than normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitors. PDT could eliminate K562 cells from K562-normal MNC mixture and the residual BCR/ABL1 positive CML cells from the bone marrow of patients with CML. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ZnPcH(1)-PDT may be a useful modality for purging CML cells for autologous grafts.","['Huang, H', 'Chen, Y', 'Chen, W', 'Wu, Y']","['Huang H', 'Chen Y', 'Chen W', 'Wu Y']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,2011/04/05 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01313.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Oct;33(5):477-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01313.x.

Improvements in its diagnosis and monitoring of leukemic patients could have a significant impact in their long-term treatment. We demonstrate that light-scattering spectroscopy (LSS)-based approaches could serve as a tool to achieve this goal. Specifically, we characterize the light scattering properties of leukemic (NALM-6) cells and compare them to those of normal lymphocytes and granulocytes in the 440-710 nm range, over +/-4 deg about the exact backscattering direction. We find that the LSS spectra are well described by an inverse power-law wavelength dependence, with a power exponent insensitive to the scattering angle but significantly higher for leukemic cells than for normal leukocytes. This is consistent with differences in the subcellular morphology of these cells, detected in differential interference contrast images. Furthermore, the residual light-scattering signal, extracted after subtracting the inverse power-law fit from the data, can be analyzed assuming a Gaussian distribution of spherical scatterers using Mie theory. This analysis yields scatterer sizes that are consistent with the diameters of cell nuclei and allows the detection of the larger nuclei of NALM-6 cells compared to those of lymphocytes and granulocytes.","['Hsiao, Austin', 'Hunter, Martin', 'Greiner, Cherry', 'Gupta, Sharad', 'Georgakoudi, Irene']","['Hsiao A', 'Hunter M', 'Greiner C', 'Gupta S', 'Georgakoudi I']","['Tufts University, Biomedical Engineering Department, Medford, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biomed Opt,Journal of biomedical optics,9605853,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1117/1.3562925 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Opt. 2011 Mar;16(3):037007. doi: 10.1117/1.3562925.,10.1117/1.3562925 [doi],,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology', 'Cellular Structures/pathology', 'Fractals', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Microscopy, Interference', 'Models, Biological', 'Optical Phenomena', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Reference Values', '*Scattering, Radiation', 'Spectrum Analysis/*methods']","['R21 CA114684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA114684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3081866,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the process of V. vulnificus infection in RBL-2H3 cells, the dynamic changes of quantitative phase images, cell volumes, and areas were observed in real time using QPM. In contrast, dramatic changes were not detected in RBL-2H3 cells infected with the noncytotoxic RtxA1 toxin mutant. The results showed good correlation between QPM analysis and biochemical assays, such as lactate dehydrogenase assay or beta-hexosaminidase release assay. We suggest that QPM is a powerful quantitative method to study the dynamic process of host cells infected with pathogens in a noninvasive manner.","['Lee, Seungrag', 'Kim, Young Ran', 'Lee, Ji Yong', 'Rhee, Joon Haeng', 'Park, Chang-Soo', 'Kim, Dug Young']","['Lee S', 'Kim YR', 'Lee JY', 'Rhee JH', 'Park CS', 'Kim DY']","['Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Department of Information and Communications, Buk-gu, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomed Opt,Journal of biomedical optics,9605853,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1117/1.3548882 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Opt. 2011 Mar;16(3):036004. doi: 10.1117/1.3548882.,10.1117/1.3548882 [doi],,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Size', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*physiology', 'Microscopy/instrumentation/*methods', 'Microscopy, Interference', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Mutation', 'Optical Devices', 'Optical Phenomena', 'Rats', 'Vibrio vulnificus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Virulence/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, dose measurement is mandatory for optimization in radiation protection to comply with international reference levels. OBJECTIVES: To estimate pediatric patient's radiation dose arising from common diagnostic x-ray examinations by measuring Entrance Surface Dose, thereby, to compare the results from established reference values and other published studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on pediatric patients under 15 years of age in Black Lion and Yekatite 12 Hospitals on May and August, 2009 respectively. Exposure factors used for commonly performed x-ray examinations like, chest, skull, abdomen, pelvis and spine were obtained from each Hospital. For each examination four age groups 0-1, 1-5, 5-10 and 10-15 years were studied. Entrance Surface Dose in air was measured using dositime dx X-ray Digital Dosimeter and Exposure Time Meter. RESULT: In Black lion hospital, the lowest and the highest calculated mean Entrance Surface Doses in microGY were 104 and 2482 for chest Anteroposterior (0-1) years and lumbo-sacral lateral (10-15) years, respectively. In Yekatit 12 hospital, the lowest and the highest calculated mean Entrance Surface Doses in microGY were 200 and 3570 for chest antrioposterior (0-1) years and lumbo-sacral lateral (10-15)years, respectively. Wide variations of doses for the same type of examination and projection have been detected in each hospital. CONCLUSION: The wider dose variation suggests that there is a pressing need to seek dose optimization to children in order to reduce the detriment caused by the unnecessary high doses imparted to them.","['Teferi, Seife', 'Admassie, Daniel', 'Abate, Tekle', 'Rao, A Durga Prasada']","['Teferi S', 'Admassie D', 'Abate T', 'Rao AD']","['Addis Ababa University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Seife Teferi. seifeteferi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ethiopia,Ethiop Med J,Ethiopian medical journal,0373223,2011/04/05 06:00,2011/04/08 06:00,['2011/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ethiop Med J. 2011 Jan;49(1):51-60.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethiopia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring/*methods', 'Radiography, Thoracic/methods/*standards', 'Radiology Department, Hospital/*standards', 'Reference Values']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro treatment of AML blasts with arsenic trioxide (ATO) down-regulated STAT3 activity within 6 hours associated with a reduced viability within 48 hours. METHODS: A phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the biologically effective dose and/or the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of ATO in vivo in conjunction with high-dose cytarabine (Hidac) and idarubicin (Ida) in patients with AML aged <60 years was conducted. Data were compared with 117 historic AML patients who had received treatment with Hidac/Ida. RESULTS: In total, 61 patients were enrolled onto 11 different dose levels (from 0.01 to 0.65 mg/kg ideal body weight). The MTD was 0.5 mg/kg. Compared with historic controls, patients who received ATO/Hidac/Ida, although they had similar pretreatment characteristics, had better overall survival (P = .039).

CXCR4 overexpression predicts a poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Data regarding the prognostic impact of CXCR4 in patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are sparse and limited to the pediatric population. METHODS: The authors analyzed CXCR4 and pCXCR4 expression in 54 adults with newly diagnosed B-ALL. CXCR4 was assessed by flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an anti-CXCR4 antibody. pCXCR4 expression was assessed using an anti-pCXCR4 antibody. RESULTS: The study group included 30 men and 24 women with a median age of 42 years (range, 17-84 years). Philadelphia chromosome was present in 19 patients. The median follow-up was 16 months (range, 17-84 months). Forty-nine patients had a complete response, and 12 patients relapsed with a median relapse free survival >120 weeks. Fifteen patients (28%) died with a median survival >125 weeks. CXCR4 detected by FC and IHC was highly correlated (P < .001). CXCR4 was not associated with clinical or laboratory findings or survival. In contrast, pCXCR4 was associated with higher leukocyte count (P = .006) and serum bilirubin level (P = .03). In multivariate analysis, pCXCR4 expression (P = .027), high serum creatinine level (P < .01), presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (P = .017), and late clinical response (P < .001) were associated with worse overall survival.

The authors report on long-term experience with NST in relapsed/refractory CLL and define prognostic factors associated with outcome. METHODS: The authors reviewed the outcome of 86 patients with relapsed/relapsed CLL enrolled in sequential NST protocols. RESULTS: The median patient age was 58 years. Patients were heavily pretreated before transplantation, and 43 required immunomanipulation after NST for persistent or recurrent disease. Immunomanipulation included withdrawal of immunosuppression, rituximab, and step-wise donor lymphocyte infusions. Of 43 patients receiving immunomanipulation, 20 (47%) experienced a complete remission. Patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype A1(+) /A2(-) /B44(-) were more likely to experience a complete remission (P = .0009), with rates of 9%, 36%, 50%, and 91%, respectively, for 0, 1, 2, and 3 of these HLA factors. This resulted in significant improvement in progression-free-survival rates of 68.2% at 5 years for patients with all 3 HLA factors. Overall, the estimated 5-year survival rate was 51%. In a multivariate model, a CD4 count of <100/mm(3) and a below normal serum immunoglobulin G level at study entry were associated with a short survival duration (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the potential cure of relapsed/refractory CLL with NST and provide the first evidence that immunoglobulin G and CD4 levels are predictive of overall survival after NST in CLL and that human leukocyte antigen alleles predict response to immunomanipulation.","['Khouri, Issa F', 'Bassett, Roland', 'Poindexter, Nancy', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Hsu, Yvonne', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Fernandez-Vina, Marcelo']","['Khouri IF', 'Bassett R', 'Poindexter N', ""O'Brien S"", 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Hsu Y', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Keating MJ', 'Champlin R', 'Fernandez-Vina M']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA. ikhouri@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/02 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26091 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Oct 15;117(20):4679-88. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26091.

This relationship has not been examined in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where absence of treatment or treatment delays can result in death within weeks or months. Induction followed by consolidation treatment, in contrast, has a high probability for remission or cure. We examined the relationship between race and health insurance and inpatient chemotherapy and survival in AML patients between the ages of 21 and 64 years. We also examined inpatient costs associated with inpatient treatment. METHODS: We used population-based data from the Virginia Cancer Registry and the Virginia Health Information discharge data for patients diagnosed with AML between 1999 and 2006 (n = 523). Adjusted logistic regression was used to measure the relationship between the independent variables and chemotherapy. We used the Cox proportional hazards method to estimate survival. RESULTS: Uninsured patients were more likely to be untreated than their privately insured counterparts (odds ratio, 4.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-10.49) and had a higher likelihood of death (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.84). Once treatment was adjusted in the survival analyses, differences between insurance groups were not statistically significant. The median 1-year cost of inpatient care following diagnosis for patients who received chemotherapy exceeded $100,000. CONCLUSION: This study addressed the urgency for health insurance that affords access to care. Without treatment, the outcome of AML is death within only a few months; with treatment, the chance for long-term remission or even cure exists.","['Bradley, Cathy J', 'Dahman, Bassam', 'Jin, Yan', 'Shickle, Lisa M', 'Ginder, Gordon D']","['Bradley CJ', 'Dahman B', 'Jin Y', 'Shickle LM', 'Ginder GD']","['Department of Healthcare Policy and Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, USA. cjbradley@vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/02 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26095 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Oct 15;117(20):4772-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26095.

Integration of messenger RNA (mRNA) and miRNA expression profiling may allow the identification of functional links between the whole transcriptome and microRNome that are involved in myeloid leukemogenesis. METHODS: We integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiles obtained from 48 newly diagnosed AML patients by using 2 different microarray platforms and performed correlation, gene ontology, and network analysis. Experimental validation was also performed in AML cell lines using miRNA oligonucleotide mimics and functional assays. RESULTS: Our analysis identified a strong positive correlation between HOX-related genes and miR-10 and miR-20a. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between miR-181a and miR-181b, miR-155, and miR-146 expression with that of genes involved in immunity and inflammation (eg, IRF7 and TLR4) and a positive correlation between miR-23a, miR-26a, miR-128a, and miR-145 expression with that of proapoptotic genes (eg, BIM and PTEN). These correlations were confirmed by gene ontology analyses, which revealed the enrichment of members of the homeobox, immunity and inflammation, and apoptosis biological processes. Furthermore, we validated experimentally the association of miR-145, miR-26a, and miR-128a with apoptosis in AML. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome in AML cells, it is possible to identify previously unidentified putative functional miRNA-mRNA interactions in AML.","['Havelange, Violaine', 'Stauffer, Nicole', 'Heaphy, Catherine C E', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Garzon, Ramiro']","['Havelange V', 'Stauffer N', 'Heaphy CC', 'Volinia S', 'Andreeff M', 'Marcucci G', 'Croce CM', 'Garzon R']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2011/04/02 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26096 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Oct 15;117(20):4696-706. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26096.

Moreover, induction of DNA damage seems to contribute to their antitumor effect. However, the apoptotic signaling pathway induced by these demethylating drugs is not well understood. Here, we have investigated the induction of apoptosis by two nucleoside DNMT inhibitors, decitabine and zebularine, in leukemic T cells. Both inhibitors induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in Jurkat, CEM-6 and MOLT-4 leukemia T cell lines, all with mutant p53, whereas resting and activated normal T lymphocytes were highly resistant to these demethylating agents. Although decitabine and zebularine showed different ability to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest among the three cell lines, they similarly activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by inducing mitochondrial alterations such as Bak activation, loss of transmembrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accordingly, Bcl-2- and Bcl-x(L) -overexpressing Jurkat cells, as well as caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells, were resistant to apoptosis induced by decitabine and zebularine. Interestingly, ROS production seemed to be necessary for the induction of apoptosis. Apoptotic events, such as Bak and caspase activation, started as soon as 20 hr after treatment with either decitabine or zebularine. In addition, progression of apoptosis triggered by both DNMT inhibitors was paralleled by the induction of DNA damage. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activated by decitabine and zebularine in p53 mutant leukemic T cells depends mainly on the induction of DNA damage.","['Ruiz-Magana, Maria J', 'Rodriguez-Vargas, Jose M', 'Morales, Jorge C', 'Saldivia, Manuel A', 'Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus', 'Ruiz-Ruiz, Carmen']","['Ruiz-Magana MJ', 'Rodriguez-Vargas JM', 'Morales JC', 'Saldivia MA', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Ruiz-Ruiz C']","['Unidad de Inmunologia, IBIMER, Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,2011/04/02 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26107 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Mar 1;130(5):1195-207. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26107.

Indeed, Pbx genes share overlapping functions and Pbx1 and Emx2 genetically interact in pelvic formation. We show that, in compound Pbx1;Pbx2 and Pbx1;Emx2 mutants, pelvic mesenchymal condensation is markedly perturbed, indicative of an upstream control by these homeoproteins.

Although the log-rank test is usually suitable for this purpose, it may result in substantial power loss when the two groups have nonproportional hazards. In a more general class of survival models of Yang and Prentice (Biometrika 92:1-17, 2005), which includes the log-rank test as a special case, we improve model efficiency by incorporating auxiliary covariates that are correlated with the survival times. In a model-free form, we augment the estimating equation with auxiliary covariates, and establish the efficiency improvement using the semiparametric theories in Zhang et al.

Although among the dematiaceous fungi Scedosporium is the most frequently isolated in blood cultures, Scedosporium endocarditis is rarely reported. We show herein a patient with acute leukaemia who developed S. prolificans endocarditis. Twelve cases were found in an extensive review of the English literature. In six cases (46%), there was predisposing heart conditions such as a prosthetic valve or an intracavitary device. Only 4 patients (31%) were immunocompromised hosts with haematologic neoplasia, solid-organ transplantation or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Exposure to Scedosporium was observed in immunocompetent patients who developed infection while in the community. Scedosporium endocarditis occurred on both sides of the heart. Systemic and pulmonary emboli and other metastatic complications were seen in all of these patients. The overall mortality was 77% and, specifically, all of the immunocompromised hosts and 6 out of 7 patients with mitral or aortic valve endocarditis died. Patients with right-sided endocarditis associated with a removable intracardiac device exhibited a better prognosis. Scedosporium endocarditis, although still rare, is an emerging infection with an ominous prognosis. At the present time, valve replacement or the removal of cardiac devices plus combined antifungal treatment may offer the best possibility of cure.","['Fernandez Guerrero, M L', 'Askari, E', 'Prieto, E', 'Gadea, I', 'Roman, A']","['Fernandez Guerrero ML', 'Askari E', 'Prieto E', 'Gadea I', 'Roman A']","['Division of Infectious Diseases and Haematology (Department of Medicine), Instituto de Investigaciones Sanitarias Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain, Aveda.

Ceramides, the central molecule of sphingolipid metabolism, are inducer of apoptosis and inhibitors of proliferation. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and glucosyleceramide, converted from ceramides by sphingosine kinase-1 (SK-1) and glucosyleceramide synthase (GCS) enzymes, respectively, inhibit apoptosis and develop resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we examined the therapeutic potentials of bioactive sphingolipids in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) alone and in combination with dasatinib in addition to investigate the roles of ceramide-metabolizing genes in dasatinib-induced apoptosis. Cytotoxic effects of dasatinib, C8:ceramide, PDMP, and SK-1 inhibitor were determined by XTT cell proliferation assay. Changes in caspase-3 enzyme activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured using caspase-3 colorimetric assay and JC-1 MMP detection kit. Expression levels of ceramide-metabolizing genes were examined by qRT-PCR. Application of ceramide analogs and inhibitors of ceramide clearance genes decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Targeting bioactive sphingolipids towards generation/accumulation of ceramides increased apoptotic effects of dasatinib, synergistically. It was shown for the first time that dasatinib induces apoptosis through downregulating expression levels of antiapoptotic SK-1 but not GCS, and upregulating expression levels of ceramide synthase (CerS) genes, especially CerS1, in K562 cells. On the other hand, dasatinib downregulates expression levels of both GCS and SK-1 and upregulate apoptotic CerS2, -5 and -6 genes in Meg-01 cells. Increasing endogenous ceramide levels and decreasing prosurvival lipids, S1P, and GC, can open the way of more effective treatment of CML.","['Gencer, Emel B', 'Ural, Ali U', 'Avcu, Ferit', 'Baran, Yusuf']","['Gencer EB', 'Ural AU', 'Avcu F', 'Baran Y']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir Institute of Technology, Gulbahce Campus, Urla, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2011/04/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1212-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Nov;90(11):1265-75. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1212-5.

In a previous study, we observed that the anti-CD176 antibody can induce the apoptosis of CD176-positive leukemic cells. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by the CD176 antibody. We found that CD95 (FAS, APO-1) and the death receptor 4 (DR4) (TRAIL-R1) are co-expressed with CD176 on the surface of defined leukemic cells as observed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses. Further-more, CD95, CD45, CD43 and DR4 are carrier proteins of CD176 in hematopoietic cells recognized by means of sandwich solid-phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and co-immunoprecipitation. As shown by microarray analysis, 20 genes which are directly related to the execution, induction or positive regulation of apoptosis, were up-regulated after CD176 antibody treatment of the KG1 cell line. Nine differentially expressed genes observed in the microarray analysis were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the KG1 and MT4 cell lines. Six genes (DAXX, CASP3, CHUK, RIPK2, NFKBIA and DFFA) out of these nine are involved in five apoptotic pathways: The CD95 signaling pathway, the DR3 and DR4/5 death receptor pathway, caspase cascade in apoptosis, the mitochondrial signaling pathway, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation and tissue homeo-stasis. Thus, we hypothesized that the CD176 antibody binds to the CD176 carbohydrate structure present on apoptosis-associated glycoproteins, such as CD95 and DR4 at the cellular surface, which activates apoptotic pathways, and consequently results in the apoptosis of CD176-positive cells. CD176 is expressed at the surface of human leukemic cells, but is almost absent in normal and benign adult human tissues. Thus, CD176 could be a promising target for anti-tumor therapy based on the induction of tumor-specific apoptosis.","['Yi, Bin', 'Zhang, Min', 'Schwartz-Albiez, Reinhard', 'Cao, Yi']","['Yi B', 'Zhang M', 'Schwartz-Albiez R', 'Cao Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Experimental Pathology, Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanism of CAS and Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 32 Jiaochang Donglu, Kunming, Yunnan 650223, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,2011/04/02 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.992 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Jun;38(6):1565-73. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.992.

H3K4 methylation is a consequence of transcriptional activity, but also has been shown to contribute to ""epigenetic memory""; i.e., it can provide a heritable landmark of previous transcriptional activity that may help promote or maintain such activity in subsequent cell descendants or lineages. A number of multi-protein complexes that control the addition of H3K4me have been described in several organisms. These Set1/MLL or COMPASS complexes often share a common subset of conserved proteins, with other components potentially contributing to tissue-specific or developmental regulation of the methyltransferase activity. Here we show that the normal maintenance of H3K4 di- and tri-methylation in the germ line of Caenorhabditis elegans is dependent on homologs of the Set1/MLL complex components WDR-5.1 and RBBP-5. Different methylation states that are each dependent on wdr-5.1 and rbbp-5 require different methyltransferases. In addition, different subsets of conserved Set1/MLL-like complex components appear to be required for H3K4 methylation in germ cells and somatic lineages at different developmental stages. In adult germ cells, mutations in wdr-5.1 or rbbp-5 dramatically affect both germ line stem cell (GSC) population size and proper germ cell development. RNAi knockdown of RNA Polymerase II does not significantly affect the wdr-5.1-dependent maintenance of H3K4 methylation in either early embryos or adult GSCs, suggesting that the mechanism is not obligately coupled to transcription in these cells. A separate, wdr-5.1-independent mode of H3K4 methylation correlates more directly with transcription in the adult germ line and in embryos. Our results indicate that H3K4 methylation in the germline is regulated by a combination of Set1/MLL component-dependent and -independent modes of epigenetic establishment and maintenance.","['Li, Tengguo', 'Kelly, William G']","['Li T', 'Kelly WG']","['Biology Department, Rollins Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,2011/04/02 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pgen.1001349 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2011 Mar;7(3):e1001349. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001349.

This discrepancy illustrates the limited success of RTK antagonists in solid tumor treatment compared with the impact of Imatinib in BCR-ABL-dependent leukemia. Here, we identified c-Abl as a signaling node interconnecting Met-RTK and p53 core pathways, and showed that its inhibition impairs Met-dependent tumorigenesis. Met ensures cell survival through a new path in which c-Abl and p38-MAPK are employed to elicit p53 phosphorylation on Ser(392) and Mdm2 upregulation. We found a clinical correlation between activated Met, phospho-p53, and Mdm2 levels in human tumors, supporting the role of this path in tumorigenesis. Our findings introduce the concept that RTK-driven tumors may be therapeutically treated by hitting signaling nodes interconnecting core pathways.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be upregulated by growth factors and are known to regulate proliferation and viability. Here, we show that IL-7 upregulates ROS in T-ALL cells in a manner that is dependent on PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activity and that relies on both NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial respiratory chain. Conversely, IL-7-induced activation of PI3K signaling pathway requires mitochondrial respiration and ROS. We have previously shown that IL-7-mediated activation of PI3K pathway drives the upregulation of the glucose transporter Glut1, promoting glucose uptake in T-ALL cells. Using phloretin to inhibit Glut function, we demonstrate that glucose uptake is mandatory for ROS upregulation in IL-7-treated T-ALL cells, suggesting that IL-7 stimulation leads to increased ROS via PI3K pathway activation and consequent upregulation of Glut1 and glucose uptake. Overall, our data reveal the existence of a critical crosstalk between PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and ROS that is essential for IL-7-mediated T-ALL cell survival, and that may constitute a novel target for therapeutic intervention.","['Silva, A', 'Girio, A', 'Cebola, I', 'Santos, C I', 'Antunes, F', 'Barata, J T']","['Silva A', 'Girio A', 'Cebola I', 'Santos CI', 'Antunes F', 'Barata JT']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2011/04/02 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/04/02 06:00'],"['2011/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201156 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.56 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jun;25(6):960-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.56.
