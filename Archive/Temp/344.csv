Infectious mononucleosis (IM) in association with acute leukemia (AL) has provided clinical investigators an active area of speculation for several years. Nineteen cases are presented for review in Table 1. The present case represents the second case of AMML to be associated with IM. It is the first case of a granulocytic leukemia reported in which active IM is occurring simultaneously with the onset of AL. Also, it represents the first case of associated IM-AL in which the diagnosis of IM is supported by lymphocyte culture data.

Differential salt elution of viral compared with cellular polymerases, as well as substrate elution, suggests the affinity nature for the matrix. Unlike some other affinity systems described, pyran-Sepharose is totally resistant to nuclease digestion and is stable at 4 degrees for several months. DNA polymerases isolated from several viruses by detergent treatment were recovered in good yield. Analysis of iodinated proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed that the DNA polymerase of avian myeloblastosis virus found in crude preparations of the virus could be purified nearly to homogeneity by a single passage through the column.

An electron microscopic and immunofluorescent study.,492-502,"The lymphocytes of five owl monkeys infected with Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) and three control monkeys were studied. Lymphocytes were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients, incubated in suspension cultures, and prepared for electron microscopic and immunofluorescent study at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the beginning of culture (AC). Buffy coats of whole blood immediately after bleeding were also prepared for study. At the time of the study, four of the five infected monkeys had died of malignant lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. HVS virions were demonstrated by electron microscopy and HVS antigens by immunofluorescence in 1 to 20 per cent of the lmyphocytes from infected monkeys in two of five cultures at 24 hours AC, four of five at 48 hours AC, and all five at 72 hours AC. There was quite good agreement between the electron microscopic and the immunofluorescent data. None of the control monkey cultures and none of the buffy coat preparations contained HVS virions or antigens. By electron microscopy the great majority of the virus particles were nucleocapsids within the nuclei of lymphocytes. Very seldom were enveloped virions observed. There was some evidence to suggest that the higher the percentage of lymphocytes containing HVS the poorer the prognosis for the monkey. HVS was isolated from all five infected monkeys by cocultivation of lymphocytes with Vero cells. Control lymphocyte cocultivations were negative.","['Giddens, W E Jr']",['Giddens WE Jr'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Haplorhini', 'Herpesviridae/*growth & development', 'Herpesvirus 2, Saimiriine/*growth & development/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/*microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Virus Replication']",1975/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/04/01 00:00'],"['1975/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1975 Apr;32(4):492-502.,,,,,,,,,,

Employing morphology as the overriding parameter four types of lines were identified. (1) Lymphoblastoid cell lines, derived from normal and neoplastic hematopoietic tissue, were characterized by the wide morphologic flexibility of individual lymphoblastoid cells, constant association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), polyclonal derivation, differentiation for immunoglobulin production (secretion) and their diploids. (2) Lymphoma cell lines. This type of line was established at a high frequency from Burkitt's lymphoma and rarely from other types of lymphoma, but never from patients without malignancy or with non-lymphoma malignancies. Important characteristics were morphologic stereotypia within each line, monoclonal derivation, common but not obligatory association with EBV, variability in the expression of Ig synthesis (no production, or membrane bound Ig, or secretion) and aneuploidy. (3) Myeloma cell lines could only rarely be obtained from patients with myeloma. The basis for classification of these lines is their production of Ig identical to the myeloma protein in vitro. Other important distinguishing features were: plasma cell morphology, absence of EBV and aneuploidy. (4) The leukemia cell line (MOLT 4) was the only line with T-cell characteristics and was easily distinguished from the other types. Important characteristics were a typical surface ultrastructure, absence of EBV and absence of immunoglobulin production, Individual lymphoblastoid lines were in principle identical whereas each line of the other three types had its own characteristic profile. The phenotypic characteristics of the lymphoblastoid lines were very stable during prolonged serial cultivation. Only in a few cases were secondary chromosomal, functional or morphologic alterations noted. We conclude that EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid lines can be obtained from non-neoplastic precursor cells from healthy as well as from diseased individuals. Lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia lines are only obtained from the respective neoplastic tissue but generally at a low frequency. With the exception of Burkitt's lymphoma, malignant hematopoietic tissue and leukemia frequently give rise to established cell lines in vitro of the lymphoblastoid type rather than lines derived from the neoplastic cells;","['Nilsson, K', 'Ponten, J']","['Nilsson K', 'Ponten J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', '*Cell Line', 'Chromosomes', 'Culture Media', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1975/02/15 00:00,1975/02/15 00:01,['1975/02/15 00:00'],"['1975/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910150217 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1975 Feb 15;15(2):321-41. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910150217.,53,,,,,,,,,

The sinusoidal walls of the normal spleen have no permanent openings. In the normal spleen, mature red blood cells and blood cells in the latest stages of maturation can be seen in diapedesis. The predominant form of transmural migration is intercellular. In MEV-inoculated animals, in which there is a vigorous erythroblastic proliferation, large numbers of erythroblasts are in transmural passage. Serial sections show that these cells migrate through the cytoplasm of the endothelial lining cells.

About 92 percent of the cats in exposure environments were positive for FeLV gsa or feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) antibody, and gsa-positive cats had lower FOCMA antibody geometric mean titers than gsa-negative cats. In the exposure environments, no differences were seen for cats of different sexes, but a higher geometric mean antibody titer was observed for cats 5 years and over when compared to younger groups. These results prove that previous reports of increased incidences of leukemia in cluster households were not due to chance alone, but rather to increased infection rates of cats in the FeLV environment. Also, they suggest that horizontal transmission of FeLV is highly efficient under crowded conditions, and that most cats naturally exposed to virus elicit an active immune response.","['Essex, M', 'Jakowski, R M', 'Hardy, W D Jr', 'Cotter, S M', 'Hess, P', 'Sliski, A']","['Essex M', 'Jakowski RM', 'Hardy WD Jr', 'Cotter SM', 'Hess P', 'Sliski A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Cats/*microbiology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Leukemia/transmission/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*immunology', 'Sex Factors']",1975/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/03/01 00:00'],"['1975/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975 Mar;54(3):637-41.,,,,,,,,,,

Only 2.7 percent of 221 cats from colony environments were antibody positive as compared to 50.4 percent of 256 cats from household environments. Incidence of FOCMA antibody and geometric mean antibody titer for pet cats from New York City representing single cat apartment habitats were substantially lower than values for unscreened cats from the Boston, Glasgow, and Detroit suburban environments. Geometric mean antibody titer for young adults in the Boston population was significantly higher than titers for kittens or aged cats. This may be due to greater mobility resulting in increased exposure to other cats. In contrast to the high frequency of FOCMA antibody positivity in pet-cat populations, less than 2 percent of the same groups were positive for virus group-specific antigen in peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets. This was interpreted as an indication that many more cats became infected with feline leukemia virus under natural conditions that the number developing persistent virus infection and/or clinical leukemia.","['Essex, M', 'Cotter, S M', 'Carpenter, J L', 'Hardy, W D Jr', 'Hess, P', 'Jarrett, W', 'Schaller, J', 'Yohn, D S']","['Essex M', 'Cotter SM', 'Carpenter JL', 'Hardy WD Jr', 'Hess P', 'Jarrett W', 'Schaller J', 'Yohn DS']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Domestic/microbiology', 'Animals, Laboratory/microbiology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Boston', 'Cats/*microbiology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Michigan', 'New York City', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*immunology', 'Sarcoma/immunology', 'Scotland']",1975/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/03/01 00:00'],"['1975/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975 Mar;54(3):631-5.,,,,,,,,,,

This ""autoinhibition"" was comparable to that observed when a 3- to 4-log excess of infectious MuLV was added to standard MuSV. The degree of inhibition was influenced by the tropism of the MuLV (or the ease of spread and propagation of MuLV in certain cells), multiplicity of infection by MuLV, amount of excess MuLV, and ability of the MuSV-transformed cells to replicate independently.

In contrast, the anamnestic PFC (IgM) response of mice preimmunized with cholera and later (2 to 9 months following priming) infected with either FV or MuLV-M, before the secondary challenge, was inhibited 90% or more when compared to the anamnestic response of controls. Hemolytic PFC response to a single (primary) immunization with sheep red blood cells (sRBC, an antigen to which laboratory mice have a natural immune background) was suppressed by infection with both viruses in a manner similar to the suppression of the secondary vibiolytic response. The suppressive effect of FV, and the lack of it, on these different immune responses was correlated with the appearance of FV-induced cell membrane antigen, FVMA, on respective individual PFC from the spleen. FVMA was detected by inhibition of PFC in the presence of specific antiserum, anti-FVMA, and complement (C). In particular, about 80% of the FV-infected mice with an anamnestic response to a secondary challenge with cholera antigen had a significant decline in the proportion of PFC (33% or more) following incubation with anti-FVMA plus C. A similar degree of inhibition was found with hemolytic (anti-sRBC) PFC from FV-infected mice. In contrast, primary vibriolytic PFC from FV-infected mice were not inhibited by anti-FVMA, i.e., they did not carry the virus-induced antigen. These results indicate absolute correlation between viral suppression of a given clone of immunocompetent cells, and antigenic alteration of individual antibody-forming cells due to the virus-infection. Furthermore, the absence of both functional inhibition and virus-induced antigen(s) in the primary immunocompetent cells and the presence of both these virus-related functions in the memory cells (either experimentally sensitized cholera memory cells or naturally sensitized sRBC memory cells) strongly suggested that the latter are selectively susceptible to oncornavirus.","['Cerny, J', 'Waner, E B']","['Cerny J', 'Waner EB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Bacterial', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Sheep/immunology', 'Vibrio cholerae/immunology']",1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1975 Feb;114(2 Pt 1):571-80.,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that relative differences in globin gene expression within and between clones largely reflect differences in the proportion of cells participating in differentiation rather than uniform differences in the extent to which all cells in these clones undergo differentiation. We call this phenotype of a clone its characteristic probability of differentiation, a property that reflects the likelihood that a cell of this clone will undergo erythrodifferentiation under given conditions. We have examined somatic hybrid cells formed between similar erythroleukemic lines, between phenotypically different erythroleukemic lines, between phenotypically different erythroleukemic lines, and between erythroleukemic cells and mouse fibroblasts. Results of these experiments demonstrate that the spontaneous and induced probabilities of differentiation may be altered in an uncoupled fashion, suggesting that each is determined at different steps leading to a common pathway of globin gene expression.","['Orkin, S H', 'Harosi, F I', 'Leder, P']","['Orkin SH', 'Harosi FI', 'Leder P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genes', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human', '*Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.72.1.98 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1975 Jan;72(1):98-102. doi: 10.1073/pnas.72.1.98.,,,PMC432248,,,,,,,

The incidence of disease development in FeLV-postive cats was more than fivefold higher than the incidence for FeLV-negative cats. Ten cases of leukemia developed in 69 infected cats, whereas one case of leukemia occurred in 59 uninfected cats. The incidence for development of diseases other than leukemia was 30.4 percent for FeLV-infected cats as opposed to 6.8 per cent for uninfected cats. This could be a result of the immunosuppressive effects of FeLV. Felv-infected cats had no evidence of subclinical anemia. Mean packed cell volumes and total leukocyte counts were about the same for infected and uninfected animals. The only variation seen in healthy FeLV-infected cats was a decreased mean lymphocyte count. The difference between mean lymphocyte count for FeLV-infected and uninfected animals was significant at the 0.999 level. These findings suggest that the incubation period for feline leukemia may be very prolonged under natural conditions and that an increased susceptibility to unrelated infectious diseases exists during this period.

A threefold increase in the total number of cells was observed during the first seven passages; the cell population increased by a factor of 10 to 20 every 7 days from passage 8 through 85; from 20 to 40 times from passage 86 through 150, and more than 40 times after 150 passages. (2) The majority of the nononucleated cells are undifferentiated blasts. (3) The karyotype of all the cells examined show the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome and a long acrocentric marker plus aneuploidy. The Giemsa-banding studies identified the Ph1 chromosome as a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22:del(22)(q12) and the long acrocentric marker as an unbalanced reciprocal translocation of one chromosome 17 and the long arm of one chromosome 15. (4) The CML cells do not produce immunoglobulins, are free of mycoplasma, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes-like virus particles. (5) CML cells have no alkaline phosphatase and myeloperoxidase activities and did not engulf inert particles. (6) Cultured CML cells provide a constant source of a specific antigen.

The virus can be transmitted readily between cats. It causes a variety of haemopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms; the most common types are alimentary, multicentric and thymic lymphosarcoma and lymphatic leukaemia. The virus is involved in the aetiology of certain other diseases including anaemia, glomerulonephritis and an immunosuppressive syndrome which predisposes cats to intercurrent infections. Many infected cats mount an immune response and do not suffer from any of these. The immune status is shown by serum antibody levels to feline leukaemia virus associated cell membrane antigens. Cats with a titre of 32 or more are most unlikely to suffer any ill effects and may eliminate the virus infection. The outcome of infection in an individual cat depends on the immunological competence of the cat, the dose of virus received and its ability to induce immunosuppression. FeLV infection can be detected by examination of tissues by electron microscopy, and by culture of virus from plasma and other tissues. In the United States, a method is now in use for the detection of leukaemia virus antigen in peripheral blood leukocytes; this is carried out on ordinary blood films. Successful prototype vaccines have been developed against FeLV.

In one experiment, 10 kittens were inoculated neonatally with Jarrett FeLV-1, an isolate of subgroup A; 6 developed anemia a few weeks later. This anemia was characterized by macrocytosis, normoblastosis, increased erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. Anemia was transient and nonfatal and occurred before the onset of lympoid malignancy. The same type of anemia was also seen in 9 of 24 kittens inoculated with Jarrett FeLV-9 of subgroups A and B. A different form of anemai occurred in another experiment in which 10 kittens were inoculated with FeLV-C of subgroup C only. All 10 kittens developed a profound aplastic or erythroblastopenic anemia in which the bone marrow became depleted of erythroid tissue; all kittens died within 16 weeks, most as a direct result of anemia. In an experiment in which kittens were inoculated with FeLV-B of subgroup B only, no kitten showed anemia. Cats with naturally acquired, nonleukemic lymphosarcoma were also studied. Of 33 lymphosarcomas in which myelophthisis was excluded as a cause, 54% of the affected cats had anemia, the features of which were consistent with hemolytic origin.

Six of these, mouse Sarcoma 180, Ehrilich ascites carcinoma, mammary adenocarconoma (TA3), leukemia L1210, mouse kidney, and canine kidney cells, differed by up to 16-fold with respect to their sensitivity and were chosen for further study. One factor contributing to the resistance was a slower formation of intracellular 5-monophosphate of IPAR (IPAMP) due to reduced adenosine kinase activity. Because of this slower formation of IPAMP in the resistant cells, a higher extracellular IPAR was required for the maintenance of equal intracellular IPAMP levels. Regardless of the degree of resistance, the rate of decay of intracellular IPAMP was similar and very rapid, with a half-life of 37 plus or minus 5 min. In the sensitive cells IPAMP was cleaved back to IPAR, while in the resistant cells IPAR was cleaved further to the free base, N-6-(delta-2-isopentenyl)adenine (IPA), which accumulated in the medium. The rate of formation of IPA constitutes an irreversible inactivation of IPAR, because IPA is not converted back to IPAMP and is not growth inhibitory. In one of the resistant cells (mouse kidney) the inactivation was so rapid that in 1 hr 25% of the extracellular (30 muM) IPAR was converted to IPA.","['Slocum, H K', 'Hakala, M T']","['Slocum HK', 'Hakala MT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Phosphates)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', '*Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Paper', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Pentosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Sarcoma 180', 'Tritium']",1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1975 Feb;35(2):423-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,49-58,"Quantitative and qualitative electron microscopic studies were performed on the mitochondria of leukemic lymphoblasts in 6 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Similar studies were performed on lymphoblasts from lymph nodes obtained from 10 surgical patients without nodal diseases. Significant quantitative differences between normal and leukemic mitochondria were not observed except for a difference in mitochondrial area per cell (P less than 0.05). This was not significant lacking, qualitative diffecrences were observed. These abnormalities included rare giant mitochondria, disrupted mitochondria with virus-like particles, smaller granules in greater abundance, mitochondrial DNA, and contact between the mitochondrion and nucleus during interphase. Fifty-three percent of the leukemic lymphoblasts contained polyribosomes, as compared to 25% of the normal lymphoblasts. The cells with the polyribosomes contained the giant mitochondria. The leukemic lymphoblasts had an appearance similar to transformed lymphocytes resulting from an immunologic stimulus. This suggests that acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be a disease which is associated with an immunologic response. From the available ultrastructural and biochemical data, it would seem that the leukemic lymphoblast is a product of an abnormal metabolism which affects its ability to differentiate. These ultrastructural findings seem to indicate the need for biochemical investigation of leukemic mitochondria.

The cell-mediated-immune (CMI) system was markedly suppressed, as evidenced by: (i) Prolonged cutaneous allograft retention time (41-84 days); (ii) Decreased lymphocyte blast transformation response to mitogens (2% of pretreatment response to pokeweed mitogen or concanavalin A) and antigen (12% of untreated control cat response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin); (iii) Reduced number of absolute erythrocyte-rosetting T-cells in the peripheral blood. This immunosuppression lasted at least 3 months, the duration of the experiment. Suppression of the hematopoietic system was also noted as evidenced by: (i) Peripheral lymphopenia lasting 3 months and neutropenia lasting 3 weeks; (ii) Bone marrow hypocellularity lasting 3 weeks; (iii) Hypoplasia of neutrophilic precursors lasting 3 weeks and erythroid precursors lasting 4 days.

This was shown by the ability of the tumor cells or their cell-free extracts to suppress standard MLC reactions. This suppression was acting mainly at the induction phase of the cytotoxic response. It could not interfere with the killing activity of the fully generated CTLs. In a Friend virus-induced leukemia FBL-3 system, at least two major components could be attributed to the cause of immunosuppression; one was of viral origin and the other was of non-viral origin. The viral component was sensitive to UV-irradiation and could be pelleted after ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g. The non-viral component was UV-resistant and was retained in the supernatant fraction after ultracentrifugation. Friend virus and 12 commonly found murine viruses have been excluded as the possible candidates causing the immunosuppression. The immunosuppressive viruses are very likely of endogenous origin and are defective in replication as shown by electromicroscopy, and by the virus focus-inducing and reverse transcriptase assays. These findings indicate that probably all tumor cells possess the immunosuppressive factor(s) which may account for their apparent lack of immunogenicity and the lack of proper immune responses in the tumor-bearing hosts.","['Ting, C C', 'Rodrigues, D', 'Ting, R C', 'Wivel, N', 'Collins, M J']","['Ting CC', 'Rodrigues D', 'Ting RC', 'Wivel N', 'Collins MJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Ultracentrifugation', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1979/11/15 00:00,1979/11/15 00:01,['1979/11/15 00:00'],"['1979/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910240519 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Nov 15;24(5):644-55. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910240519.,,,,,,,,,,

NCS perturbations of cycling bone marrow cells were studied in two patients receiving the drug by continuous infusion. Both of these patients showed G2 accumulation of marrow cells following treatment. Immunochemically detectable levels of drug were seen in three patients treated with continuous infusion.

In addition, citrovorum factor-induced reversal of MTX was several orders of magnitude more efficient in the presence of both FdUrd and dThd than in the presence of dThd alone or in the absence of both nucleosides. Likewise, the presence of FdUrd (3 microM) and dThd (5.6 microM) completely prevented the lethality of 0.3 mM MTX to L1210 cells in culture medium supplemented with micromolar concentrations of citrovorum factor. We propose that this protection against the cytotoxic effects of MTX by dThd, hypoxanthine, and FdUrd have a common biochemical mechanism--namely, inhibition of the de novo synthesis of thymidylate by either a direct [FdUrd; inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (thymidylate synthase; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUMP C-methyl-transferase, EC 2.1.1.45)] or indirect (dThd and hypoxanthine; feedback inhibition by anabolites on ribonucleotide reductase and deoxycytidylate deaminase) effect. The resultant decreased rate of loss of reduced folates due to de novo thymidylate synthesis would allow a higher degree of inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase to be endured without damage to the cell.","['Moran, R G', 'Mulkins, M', 'Heidelberger, C']","['Moran RG', 'Mulkins M', 'Heidelberger C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methotrexate/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*metabolism']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.11.5924 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Nov;76(11):5924-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.11.5924.,,,PMC411765,,,,,,,

This fraction also produced optimal stimulation of normal human marrow. During remission, the patient's marrow cells did not grow in liquid culture and produced normal numbers of granulocytic and erythroid colonies in response to CSA and erythropoietin. Extended culture of the AML cells resulted in cell differentiation evidenced by decreasing proliferative capacity and by morphological and histochemical changes.

The leukemic B lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia express these antigens very well. In the present study they were readily detected by several techniques utilizing both allo- and heteroantisera. However, the leukemic B cells from most patients were found to be extremely poor stimulating cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction. This was particularly apparent when comparisons were made on a B-cell basis with isolated normal B lymphocytes. Leukemic cell death, abnormal kinetics of leukemic cell-mediated stimulation, and serum or cellular suppressor factors do not appear to explain these findings. Studies comparing cells from a leukemic patient with those of her HLA identical sibling and results of mixed lymphocyte reactions between normal and leukemic subjects discordant for D-region-associated Ia antigens ruled out genetic explanations for the differences observed. Experiments with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells depleted of T cells and monocytes exclude the quantitative deficiency of monocytes which is found in the peripheral blood of most leukemic patients as an explanation. The present results with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells indicate that the mere expression of the Ia-like antigens by cell populations does not render them effective stimulators. The accumulated evidence obtained indicate that abnormalities, particularly of membrane function and metabolism, known to occur in chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes may be involved in the poor stimulatory capacity of the leukemic B cells.","['Halper, J P', 'Fu, S M', 'Gottlieb, A B', 'Winchester, R J', 'Kunkel, H G']","['Halper JP', 'Fu SM', 'Gottlieb AB', 'Winchester RJ', 'Kunkel HG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Rabbits']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI109567 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1979 Nov;64(5):1141-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI109567.,,,PMC371258,,,,,,,

It was confirmed that the mitogenic reactivity of whole cell populations (PBL) was delayed and depressed. When CLL rosette-forming cells (RFC) were stimulated, their 3H-thymidine uptake was increased, but the pattern of the response was similar to that of whole PBL, thus suggesting some impairment of these cells. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible recruitment of B cells, generally thought to be unresponsive, some co-culture experiments were performed in which 10(4) normal lymphocytes and 10(5) CLL whole PBL or RFC-depleted cell populations were stimulated with mitogens. An amplified response of the CLL lymphocytes was obtained in all co-cultures, and this effect was more evident when specific T cell stimulants were used; autologous CLL T lymphocytes, on the contrary, failed to display such a 'synergic' effect. These results indicate that normal lymphocytes are able to recruit a large number of CLL lymphocytes in the mitogenic response; furthermore, the fact that in co-cultures of CLL T-depleted fractions a better response was obtained with T cell mitogens suggests that the definition of CLL as a clonal expansion of unresponsive 'B' lymphocytes may be inadequate.","['Neri, A', 'Paciucci, P A', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Camba, L', 'Comis, M', 'Iacopino, P', 'Nobile, F', 'Lombardo, V T']","['Neri A', 'Paciucci PA', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Camba L', 'Comis M', 'Iacopino P', 'Nobile F', 'Lombardo VT']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Ric Clin Lab,La Ricerca in clinica e in laboratorio,7613947,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02905029 [doi]'],ppublish,Ric Clin Lab. 1979 Jan-Mar;9(1):67-77. doi: 10.1007/BF02905029.,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanism of reduced bone marrow toxicity in mice.,1103-11,"Chlorozotocin is a chloroethyl nitrosourea with a glucose carrier that has curative activity for the murine L1210 leukemia, but is nonmyelosuppressive in mice. To determine the mechanism for this unique property of reduced bone marrow toxicity, comparative studies were conducted with chlorozotocin and CCNU, a myelotoxic chloroethyl nitrosourea. Suspensions of L1210 leukemia and murine bone marrow cells were incubated for 2 h with 0.1 mM [(14)C]-chloroethyl chlorozotocin or CCNU. Chlorozotocin demonstrated a fourfold increased covalent binding of the chloroethyl group to L1210 nuclei when compared to equimolar CCNU. Chlorozotocin alkylation of L1210 cells resulted in the binding of 57 pmol of [(14)C]ethyl group/mg of DNA, which represented a 2.3-fold increased alkylation when compared to CCNU. In marked contrast, the binding of the chloroethyl group to bone marrow nuclei was equivalent for both drugs. In addition, chlorozotocin alkylation of murine bone marrow DNA, 45 pmol of [(14)C]ethyl group/mg of DNA, was equivalent to that of CCNU. The ratio of L1210:bone marrow DNA alkylation was 1.3 for chlorozotocin compared to 0.6 for CCNU. The intracellular carbamoylation of L1210 and bone marrow protein by CCNU was 400- to 600-fold greater than that produced by chlorozotocin. After a 2-h exposure to 0.1, 0.05, or 0.01 mM drug, both chlorozotocin and CCNU produced a reduction in the cloning efficiency of L1210 cells that was dose dependent. However, chlorozotocin was significantly more cytotoxic than CCNU at all three molar concentrations (P < 0.01). Chlorozotocin, 0.1 mM, reduced L1210 DNA synthesis to 1% of control by 48 h, in contrast to 16% with equimolar CCNU (P < 0.01). In mice bearing 10(5) L1210 cells, chlorozotocin produced its optimal antitumor activity (332% increased life span [ILS]) at doses of 48-64 mumol/kg, with >50% indefinite survivors. In contrast, CCNU at the same molar doses resulted in only a 191% ILS; a CCNU dose of 128 mumol/kg was required for comparable optimal L1210 antitumor activity, 413% ILS. On a molar basis, the dose of chlorozotocin that produced optimal in vivo L1210 antitumor activity was one-third to one-half that of CCNU. Chlorozotocin, unlike CCNU, produced no murine bone marrow toxicity at its optimal therapeutic dose. This unique combination of antitumor activity without myelosuppression can be correlated with the advantageous ratio of L1210:bone marrow in vitro DNA alkylation by chlorozotocin (1.3) as compared to equimolar CCNU (0.6).","['Panasci, L C', 'Green, D', 'Schein, P S']","['Panasci LC', 'Green D', 'Schein PS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '0 (Proteins)', '3053LTY75Z (chlorozotocin)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Streptozocin/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1979/10/01 00:00,1979/10/01 00:01,['1979/10/01 00:00'],"['1979/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI109549 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1979 Oct;64(4):1103-11. doi: 10.1172/JCI109549.,,,PMC372222,,,,,,,

The methods were developed using radioactively labeled drugs, but they should be adaptable to studies using nonlabeled compounds. Sephadex G-25 chromatography or trichloroacetic acid precipitation were utilized for isolation of the macromolecular cell fraction; prior treatment of this fraction with RNase or heating at 65 degrees for 15 min resulted in selective removal of RNA or the thymidylate synthetase complex, respectively, from the precipitable fraction. Free intracellular drug metabolites present in the acid-soluble fraction were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography.

These results indicate that cytocidal activity of NCS is greatly inhibited through contact with tumor cells, blood cells, spleen cells, and/or hemorrhagic ascites. This may be one of the reasons why L1210 cells, which show high sensitivity against NCS in vitro, are less sensitive in vivo. In order to explain these findings, the possibility of inactivation of NCS by the cells or reduction of free active NCS molecules by the binding or adsorption with the cells is discussed.

Possible mechanisms for regulation of the lymphocyte contractile apparatus and its importance in a number of lymphocyte functions are discussed.","['Fechheimer, M', 'Cebra, J J']","['Fechheimer M', 'Cebra JJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Polymers)', '9013-26-7 (Actomyosin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Actins/*isolation & purification', 'Actomyosin/isolation & purification', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Binding Sites', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*analysis', 'Myosins/*isolation & purification', 'Polymers', 'Rabbits']",1979/06/01 00:00,1979/06/01 00:01,['1979/06/01 00:00'],"['1979/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 Jun;122(6):2590-7.,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of exogenous peritoneal cells from normal C57BL/6 MIce enhanced the in vitro secondary cell-mediated cytotoxic response of both spleen and lymph node cells as responding cells against syngeneic FBL-3 leukemia. Peritoneal phagocytic macrophages seemed to be responsible for the enhancement. No inhibitory effect was demonstrated by the addition of peritoneal macrophages at a concentration as high as 20%, whereas the primary cytotoxic allograft response was significantly suppressed. In the present studies, there was no absolute restriction of macrophage-T cell interaction by an H-2 barrier. Supernatants of peritoneal macrophage cultures also enhanced this cell-mediated cytotoxic response. There was no difference between the effects of syngeneic or allogeneic peritoneal macrophage culture supernatants.","['Igarashi, T', 'Rodrigues, D', 'Ting, C C']","['Igarashi T', 'Rodrigues D', 'Ting CC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Idoxuridine/metabolism', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rabbits', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1979/04/01 00:00,1979/04/01 00:01,['1979/04/01 00:00'],"['1979/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 Apr;122(4):1519-27.,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the effect of other inducers, s-ch as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethylene-bisacetamide (HMBA), and butyrate, on poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis was examined. The extent of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in nuclei of FLC treated with DMSO or HMBA began to decrease before many phenotypic changes including hemoglobin production and reached 30--50% of the level of nontreated control when the cells enter the stationary phase. FLC variants unresponsive to HMBA or DMSO did not exhibit as low an activity of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis as their parent cells did by treatment with these inducers. In contrast, butyrate stimulated poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis transiently but distinctly (about 50%) at an early stage of culture (6--24 hr), but suppressed it at a later stage. Neither the cell growth nor degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) is correlated with the effect of inducers.

This study showed differential biochemical effects of the potent inducers DMSO and butyrate on the heme biosynthetic pathway in three clones of Friend MEL cells. When the cells were incubated with combinations of DMSO and butyrate, hemoglobin production was less than that amount produced when each inducer was incubated singly with the cells. Procaine, a local anesthetic that competes with Ca2+ and thus affects membrane permeability, slightly inhibited DMSO-mediated hemoglobin production but almost tripled the level stimulated by butyrate alone. Similarly, EDTA, which also can bind Ca2+ and which can modify the activity of heme biosynthetic enzymes, also inhibited hemoglobin production mediated by DMSO, whereas it stimulated hemoglobin production in cells exposed to butyrate. Total porphyrin accumulation was greater in DMSO-treated cells than in butyrate-treated cells, which suggests that butyrate induces the enzymes of the heme pathway more efficiently than does DMSO.

These observations lead us to speculate that leukaemic null-cells which possess a stimulating capacity may represent less differentiated leukaemic B lymphoid cells (early B-cell precursors) and leukaemic null-cells which possess no stimulating capacity may represent less differentiated leukaemic T lymphoid cells (early T-cell precursor).","['Han, T', 'Minowada, J']","['Han T', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1978 Aug;35(2):333-9.,,,PMC1457255,,,,,,,

It has recently been postulated that some patients with CML may undergo a T lymphoblastic crisis because the leukaemic blasts from these patients have high terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity and that some patients may undergo a non-T/non-B lymphoblastic crisis since leukaemic blasts from a majority of morphologically lymphoid type CML-BC cases react with antiserum specific for non-T/non-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The present study shows that leukaemic blasts from each of six patients with Ph1-positive chronic myelocytic leukaemia-blastic crisis (CML-BC) exerted a strong stimulation on allogeneic lymphocytes in 'one-way' mixed lymphocyte reaction. There was no apparent difference in stimulating capacity between morphologically myeloid type (four cases) and lymphoid type (two cases). The stimulating capacity of leukaemic blasts from patients with CML-BC was quite similar to that of blasts from all patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and from some patients with non-T/non-B type ALL. Leukaemic blasts from a patient with T-cell type ALL and cultured leukaemic T lymphoblastoid cells (2 lines) consistently failed to stimulate while cultured leukaemic null-cells (4 lines) consistently exerted a strong stimulation in 'one-way' mixed lymphocyte reaction. These observations suggest that leukaemic cells from patients with CML-BC, morphologically lymphoblastic type, are not T lymphoblasts although the possibility that these cells are non-T/non-B lymphoblasts cannot be ruled out entirely.","['Han, T', 'Gomez, G A', 'Minowada, J']","['Han T', 'Gomez GA', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1978 Aug;35(2):299-305.,,,PMC1457272,,,,,,,

In five patients, autologous AML cells suppressed 3H-Tdr uptake by lymphocytes stimulated with up to three different allogeneic cells. Responses to allogeneic AML cells were more strongly suppressed than responses to pooled allogeneic lymphocytes. Suppression was abolished by ultrasonic disintegration of the autologous AML cells, suggesting that a soluble factor was not involved. Suppression was absent from autologous AML cells exposed to ultraviolet light, or when untreated autologous AML cells were present in ratios of less than 1:1 to lymphocytes, or when added 24 or more hours after stimulation of remission lymphocytes with allogeneic cells. It is suggested that suppression is a property of the differentiative level of AML cells, rather than of their malignant properties, although malignant-transformation may bring AML cells into contact with circulating T cells in vivo.

The differences in the ontogeny of the two activities suggest that they are distinct. Preliminary effector cell characterization studies suggest that: (i) NK and ADCC in the pig are physically not separable; (ii) the majority of the cytotoxic activity on a cell-per-cell basis is mediated by the non-T lymphocyte fraction; and (iii) the rosetted T cells, which account for about 60% of the total pig peripheral blood lymphocytes, have low but demonstrable cytotoxic activity as well.","['Koren, H S', 'Amos, D B', 'Kim, Y B']","['Koren HS', 'Amos DB', 'Kim YB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/immunology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Line', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Swine/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1978/10/01 00:00,1978/10/01 00:01,['1978/10/01 00:00'],"['1978/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.75.10.5127 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1978 Oct;75(10):5127-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.75.10.5127.,,,PMC336277,,,,,,,

If biphasic plots are assumed, the two linear components show markedly diminished receptor capacity (15 and 137 ng/10(6) lymphocytes) in CLL as compared to controls (60 and 668 ng). In contrast, affinity was similar in patients (1.0 x 10(8) M(-1) and 2.1 x 10(6) M(-1)) and controls (1.8 x 10(8) M(-1) and 1.5 x 10(6) M(-1)). Highly purified B cells from patients and controls generated binding data comparable to that obtained from the mixed lymphocyte (ML) suspensions from which they originated. Maximal DNA synthesis of highly purified, normal, thymus-derived (T) and B cells in response to LPHA stimulation was comparable to that of ML (mitotic index [MI] 19.9, 20.1, and 23.4, respectively), though B-cell responses were slightly delayed. In CLL the markedly decreased and delayed DNA synthesis by ML (MI 2.3), and by highly purified T (MI 1.6) and B (MI 1.9) cells seemed out of proportion to their decreased receptor capacity for LPHA. The impaired mitogenic responses of leukemic cells from five patients were not enhanced when cocultured with normal lymphocytes. In contrast, cells from eight patients inhibited cocultured normal lymphocyte responses to LPHA by 94.3%. Sera from these patients and supernates from their cultured cells did not mediate this suppressor effect. These observations indicate that the decreased DNA synthesis observed in CLL is not an attribute of B cells and does not represent the expected response of a few residual normal T lymphocytes, but rather reflects impaired responses by all CLL cells. The defect does not relate to the density or function of membrane receptors for LPHA, to the presence of inhibitors in these patients' sera, or to depletion of helper T cells. Our data strongly suggest that one mechanism for the immunoincompetence observed in CLL reflects excessive suppressor-cell activity.","['Faguet, G B']",['Faguet GB'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Lectins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI109280 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1979 Jan;63(1):67-74. doi: 10.1172/JCI109280.,,,PMC371919,,,,,,,

Although orderly follicular growth is found in the fetal ovary, many of the early growing follicles show abnormalties. Follicles with irregular granulosa layers, with hypertrophied or with underdeveloped theca layers, are characteristic. Such follicles are rarely seen after birth. The ovary during childhood is an active organ in which follicular growth and follicular atresia normally take place. Follicles begin to grow at all ages, differentiate to preantral and antral follicles, but degenerate at various stages of their development before they reach pre-ovulatory sizes. Follicular growth in the fetus and children is dependent on hormones. Fetal gonadotrophins are necessary to ensure normal and sequential follicular growth before birth. During childhood a close correlation between follicle growth, hormone response and hormone production seems to exist. Certain diseases and treatment with cytotoxic agents or radiation to the abdomen influence ovarian development and follicular growth. Chromosome abnormalities, especially Turner's syndrome, trisomy 18 or 21, alter normal ovarian development by reducing the pool of available follicles and inhibiting follicular growth. Treatment with cytotoxic drugs inhibits follicular growth, while abdominal irradiation in childhood unless the ovaries are adequately shielded causes permanent damage by destroying the small follicles.","['Peters, H', 'Byskov, A G', 'Grinsted, J']","['Peters H', 'Byskov AG', 'Grinsted J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Endocrinol Metab,Clinics in endocrinology and metabolism,0357424,"['9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, 16-18', 'Down Syndrome/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/physiology', 'Gestational Age', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Luteinizing Hormone/physiology', 'Ovarian Follicle/embryology/*growth & development/ultrastructure', 'Ovary/growth & development', 'Puberty', 'Trisomy', 'Turner Syndrome/physiopathology']",1978/11/01 00:00,1978/11/01 00:01,['1978/11/01 00:00'],"['1978/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0300-595x(78)80005-x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1978 Nov;7(3):469-85. doi: 10.1016/s0300-595x(78)80005-x.,72,,,,,,,,,

The TCGF-induced effect could not by duplicated by the addition of fresh medium or a mitogenic concentration of concananvalin A. Although TCGF augmented the proliferation of antigen-nonreactive cells, antigen-reactive cells appeared to be preferentially stimulated by TCGF. Finally, it was shown that depletion of TCGF from MTLC resulted in an impairment of proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic effector cells. These findings demonstrate that soluble factors are involved in the regulation of in vitro cell-mediated immune responses in an analogous manner to similar factors that have been shown to regulate humoral immune responses.

An inhibitory activity (I-activity) for the induction of differentiation was present in conditioned medium and lysate of MI cells resistant to the D-factor. The I-activity was non-dialyzable, heat-labile and protease-sensitive. Most of the activity was recovered in the fraction precipitated with 30-50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The fraction inhibited induction of phagocytic activity, migrating activity and morphological changes in MI cells, which are typical properties of differentiated MI cells. Low levels of I-activity were detected in conditioned medium or lysate of MI cells sensitive to the D-factor. The resistant MI cells were sensitized to the D-factor by treatment with a low concentration (5-10 ng/ml) of actinomycin D. The I-activity in conditioned medium of actinomycin D-treated resistant cells decreased with development of sensitivity to the D-factor. These results suggest that production of the I-activity in the resistant cells is closely associated with resistance of the MI cells to the D-factor.","['Okabe, J', 'Hayashi, M', 'Honma, Y', 'Hozumi, M']","['Okabe J', 'Hayashi M', 'Honma Y', 'Hozumi M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Floxuridine', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Rats']",1978/11/15 00:00,1978/11/15 00:01,['1978/11/15 00:00'],"['1978/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910220511 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1978 Nov 15;22(5):570-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910220511.,,,,,,,,,,

In the remaining three cases (histiocytic lymphomas) the immunological nature of the tumor cells could not be determined. All reactivity to mitogenic stimuli of cells from B-cell lymphomas was due to residual normal T cells. In follicular lymphocytic lymphomas more reactive T cells prevailed among the malignant B cells than in diffuse lymphocytic lymphomas. Heterogeneity among B-cell lymphomas was indicated by differences in intensity of fluorescence with anti-Ig reagents and in stimulatory capacity in mixed lymphocyte culture. T-cell lymphomas were characterized by high percentages of T cells together with impaired responses to stimuli.

Immunosuppression of the host influenced very differently the growth of transplanted malignancies. The growth of thymoma and of Ehrlich tumor was regularly enhanced. The growth of fibrosarcoma and of melanoma, on the other hand, was retarded in mice pretreated with EAF and X-rays, or remained unchanged in mice pretreated with drugs. Leukaemia growth was not influenced by any immunosuppressive treatment; the only exception was enhanced growth of lymphoid leukaemia in animals pretreated with EAF. Thus different tumors grew differently in animals immunosuppressed by the same immunosuppressive agent, while different immunosuppressive treatment changed the growth of one particular tumor always in the same way. From this we concluded: (1) there is no rule as to how immunosuppression of the host will influence tumor growth; and (2) the way in which the malignant growth will be changed depends mainly upon the type of the tumor and probably not very much upon the type of immunosuppressive treatment.","['Pavelic, K', 'Hrsak, I']","['Pavelic K', 'Hrsak I']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Z Krebsforsch Klin Onkol Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Zeitschrift fur Krebsforschung und klinische Onkologie.

The tumors induced by these cells, as well as by a cell line derived from it, grew progressively and led to death of the animals between 3 and 7 wk after tumor transplantation. No evidence for production of virus from these cells was obtained or for the presence of viral antigens (p30, gp69/71). From both cell variants, sarcoma virus genome could be rescued by infection with helper virus, resulting in the establishment of a cell line producing focus- and XC plaque-forming virus. The rescued producer cells very frequently also produced tumors which finally grew progressively. The nonproducer cells were not immunogenic, as was demonstrated in cross transplantation tests and in studies for cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) and complement-dependent antibody-mediated cytotoxicity (AMC). The producer cells, however, were demonstrated to possess a strong immunogenicity. The nonproducer cells, though nonimmunogenic, revealed a weak immunosensitivity when used for challenge in the transplantation protection assay or as target cell for the demonstration of AMC and CMC, if the immune response was induced by cells producing the sarcoma-helper virus complex, but not by cells producing only helper virus. The nonproducer cells, as well as their rescued producer derivative, showed a stronger reactivity with cytotoxic antibodies than with cytotoxic cells, whereas the helper virus-producing cell line was comparably suitable as target cell for AMC and CMC. The recurrence of a regressed Moloney sarcoma is assumed to be the result of the occurrence of transformed nonproducer cells escaping immune destruction, and not as a consequence of a depleted immune resistance in the host.","['Weiland, E', 'Mussgay, M', 'Weiland, F']","['Weiland E', 'Mussgay M', 'Weiland F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions', 'Immunity', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology/pathology']",1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.148.2.408 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1978 Aug 1;148(2):408-23. doi: 10.1084/jem.148.2.408.,,,PMC2184942,,,,,,,

Methods included immunofluorescence microscopy with antisera against T-cells, B-cells and MLV intact virus, routine histology, and electron microscopy. Following time sequence of changes was observed in mice with oncogenic MLV- and GLV-A infection but not in GLV-T infection: Significant decrease of Ig receptor fluidity and expression of virus antigen were observed already at the initial investigation, i.e. 2 weeks post virus infection. This was followed by significant decreases in percent T-cells 5--8 weeks later, accompanied by histologic atrophy of the thymus and of thymus-dependent regions of lymphatic tissues. Another 2--8 weeks after the decrease in percent T-cells occurred, the first lymphomatous foci became obvious in the thymus. Clinically overt and generalized lymphoma was diagnosed at 20--30 weeks post virus infection. Ultrastructurally, some changes in the arrangement and quantity of cytoplasmic microfilaments were noted in proliferating lymphoblasts and in lymphoma cells.

Two classes of cross-links were demonstrated, based on sensitivity to proteinase K; the proteinase-sensitive cross-links appear to be DNA-protein cross-links, and the proteinase-resistant class may include interstrand cross-links. Proteinase-sensitive cross-links form more rapidly than do proteinase-resistant cross-links in cells treated with chloroethylnitrosoureas, perhaps because these agents can chloroethylate protein sulfhydryl or amino groups followed by rapid reaction of these chloroethylated groups with DNA. Although both types of cross-links produced by nitrogen mustard disappeared or were repaired after 24 hr, the removal of cross-links produced by chloroethylnitrosoureas either did not occur or was incomplete in 24 hr.

It is most often diagnosed as acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Leukaemic skin nodules and hepatosplenomegaly are the most frequent clinical findings noted. The laboratory manifestations include a markedly elevated white count with a large percentage of blasts, and a bone marrow aspirate that is cellular with a monotonous population of immature cells. Neonatal leukaemoid and leucoerythroblastic reactions may cause diagnostic confusion. In particular, the neonate with Down's syndrome can manifest either AML or a profound transient myeloproliferative syndrome that is clinically and haematologically indistinguishable from congenital AML. In contrast to congenital leukaemia, however, this myeloproliferative syndrome is transient and resolves spontaneously without anti-leukaemia therapy. On the other hand, untreated congenital leukaemia is a fatal disease. For this reason it is important to establish early diagnosis of congenital leukaemia and institute therapy.

The stimulatory and suppressive effects were noted only when MER was present during the initial 24-48 hours of the 6-day culture.

During recent decades an increasingly reductionist approach to structure has enabled such correlations to extent from those easily visible to the naked eye to those who resolution requires sophisticated electron microscopy. Although recognition of clinical--pathological correlations has evident advantages, there are instances, such as diabetes mellitus, where such recognition appeared to lull investigators into believing that the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the disease had been found. Moreover, the recognition of a structural abnormality, such as the extra chromosome in Down syndrome, may sometimes have delayed rather than accelerated research on metabolic aspects of the disease. The advances in medical understanding that have proceeded from a correlation of structure with function have enabled diseases to be investigated at different levels. This has led to a more sophisticated redefinition of the meaning of clinical--pathological correlations and to the surprising finding that immense structural variability can be tolerated by the human organism without its function being recognizably perturbed. Indeed, some molecular variations of structure lead to a distinct biological advantage under singular environmental conditions. Finally, where molecular structure is known in its most intimate detail, the distinction between structure and function becomes less easy to discern.","['Bearn, A G']",['Bearn AG'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,,IM,"['Cell Biology', 'Diabetes Mellitus/metabolism', 'Disease/*etiology', 'Down Syndrome/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', 'Molecular Conformation', '*Pathology', 'Viruses/ultrastructure']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/9780470720264.ch3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1976;(44):25-40. doi: 10.1002/9780470720264.ch3.,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, DNA synthesis in L1210 cells was suppressed to less than 10% of control for a minimum of 72 hr.

Although it is important to continue chemical and surgical treatment of cancer, support of the anti-tumor immune system of the host should also be considered. Long term remission has been reported in leukemia by treating with BCG after chemotherapy whereas surgical treatment is usually more effective in preventing cancer recurrence in digestive organ cancer. The first step is extirpating the tumor as thoroughly as possible and the second step is chemo-immunotherapy. Cancer immunity, however weak, constitutes the basis for other treatments in selectively attacking cancer cells remaining after surgery, chemotherapy or irradiation. Immunotherapy should thus not replace chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but these methods should be employed in combination to attain more favorable results.","['Orita, K', 'Miwa, H', 'Mannami, T', 'Konaga, E', 'Yumura, M']","['Orita K', 'Miwa H', 'Mannami T', 'Konaga E', 'Yumura M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Acta Med Okayama,Acta medica Okayama,0417611,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunotherapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium bovis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/immunology/surgery/*therapy', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/surgery']",1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Okayama. 1977 Aug;31(4):217-34.,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the serum of these patients inhibited the mitotic reactivity of both autologous and homologous normal lymphocytes. Since incubation with CLL serum did not affect the SRBC-rosetting capacity of normal lymphocytes, we believe that CLL serum interferes with some metabolic stage in blastogenesis rather than at the level of mitogen membrane interaction. The in vitro transformation of lymph node, bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes in some of these patients was also investigated. Stimulation of peripheral blood cells with plant mitogens resulted in a more serious impairment of the response than that found with bone marrow and lymph node cells. This could be explained by the fact that, although CLL is a widespread lymphoproliferative disorder, some preferential homing of normally reactive cells in the bone marrow and lymph nodes cannot be excluded. Finally, since no stimulation was observed in mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC), our experiments provide evidence that no antigenic differences are detectable in CLL lymphoid populations.","['Neri, A', 'Paciucci, P A', 'Nobile, F', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Camba, L', 'Comis, M', 'Iacopino, P', 'Trapani Lombardo, V']","['Neri A', 'Paciucci PA', 'Nobile F', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Camba L', 'Comis M', 'Iacopino P', 'Trapani Lombardo V']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Ric Clin Lab,La Ricerca in clinica e in laboratorio,7613947,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation']",1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02879478 [doi]'],ppublish,Ric Clin Lab. 1977 Apr-Jun;7(2):124-35. doi: 10.1007/BF02879478.,,,,,,,,,,

We covalently coupled NCS to the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of agarose and obtained a product that, by a variety of biochemical and immunological criteria, has been demonstrated to be devoid of any free or loosely bound NCS. Agarose-bound NCS, which is unable to enter cells because of its size, retains a significant amount of inhibitory activity (ID50, 6 to 15 X 10(-9) M) and is also capable of inhibiting tritiated deoxythymidine incorporation into CCRF-CEM cells.

Thin sections were compared with freeze-fracture replicas to elucidate further aspects of leucocyte cytology. The atypia exhibited in these cells (eosinophils, basophils and neutrophil granulocytes) consisted mostly of a disorganization of granulopoiesis with hyper- and hypogranulation, a pathological increase in the number of nuclear blebs and a maturation asynchrony sometimes leading to Pelger-like cell forms. Moreover, a presumptive stem cell was demonstrated in the erythopoietic and granulocytic cell lines resembling CFU cells. In conclusion, granulopoiesis in CMGM exhibited abnormalities as generally observed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

Suppression is demonstrated by increasing the concentration of cells added to cultures and does not require preactivation of suppressor cells. Suprression of 3H-thymidine incorporation occurred if the high concentrations of MNL were added to cultures before the proliferative responses commenced. This suppressive effect of high cell concentration upon 3H-thymidine incorporation is removed by depleting MNL present in high numbers of cells that adhere to foreign surfaces or by preincubating these cells with cycloheximide, puromycin, or pactamycin. The suppressor cell, which only functions when present in a viable state, is radioresistant, adheres to foreign surfaces, remains active through 5 days in culture, and equates with the presence of a cell that is rich in cytoplasmic esterase. The suppressor cell may be of the monocyte series and did not appear to belong to either the T or the B lymphocyte series. This study provides additional evidence that normal immune reactivity in man is under regulatory control. The suppressor mechanism identified herein with normal human MNL is probably related to a similar type of suppression (but at a much lower cell concentration) that has been described with Hodgkin's disease and solid tumors.","['Laughter, A H', 'Twomey, J J']","['Laughter AH', 'Twomey JJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '23668-11-3 (Pactamycin)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Pactamycin/pharmacology', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium']",1977/07/01 00:00,1977/07/01 00:01,['1977/07/01 00:00'],"['1977/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Jul;119(1):173-9.,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests an important role for cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) in the destruction of grafts and tumours. Quantitative methods allow the assay of CTL and of CTL memory cells which appear in lymphoid tissues, blood, grafts and tumours during rejection. The formation of CTL and CTL memory cells can also be induced in vitro, and the functional activity of such cells has been demonstrated in transfer experiments. In the present report, results of experiments will be discussed which were aimed at the analysis of the characteristics of memory cells, of the functional activity in vivo of CTL induced in secondary mixed leucocyte cultures (MLC), and of the specificity of CTL formed in response to tumours induced by the Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV). Our results show that there exists a qualitative difference between the original precursor of the CTL and its memory cell, and that the transfer by the intravenous route of CTL induced in secondary MLC protects irradiated mice effectively and specifically against allogeneic tumour growth. In the MSV system, studies of the specificity of CTL show that syngeneic tumour cells are lysed preferentially (and that allogeneic MSV induced tumour cells are not lysed), indicating a genetic restriction in their activity.","['Brunner, K T', 'Cerottini, J C']","['Brunner KT', 'Cerottini JC']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Immunol (Paris),Annales d'immunologie,0353045,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Graft Rejection', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Immunol (Paris). 1977 Jan-Mar;128(1-2):473-83.,,Mecanisme d'action des lymphocytes T cytolytiques dans le rejet des cellules cibles tumorales,,,,,,,,

We have studied the stimulating and responding capacity of lymphocytes from patients with different immunodeficiency syndromes in a one-way MLC-LMIF assay. Lymphocytes from patients known to have qualitative and quantitative defects of T cell or B cell functions (Hodgkin's disease, mycosis fungoides, thymoma, chronic lymphatic leukemia) were found to respond poorly as measured by mediator production although their stimulating fuction was frequently retained. Patients with advanced solid tumors often had both MLC-stimulating and responding functions depressed. There was no apparent correlation between mitogen response and MLC-induced LMIF responses or between MLC proliferative response (as measured by thymidine incorporation) and mediator production.

We performed these tests using, as responder cells, unfractionated mononuclear cells and T-cell-enriched populations obtained after nylon-wool column filtration. The results showed that nonadherent T-cell-enriched populations from both CLL patients and normal controls responded to allogeneic stimulation and that adherent cell fractions from normal individuals, and often from CLL patients, provided a stronger stimulus in MLC than did nonadherent cells. T-cell-enriched populations from normal individuals showed increased DNA synthesis after autologous mixed lymphocyte culture (AMLC) with adherent cells, but this phenomenon was uniformly lacking when the same experiment was performed with cell populations from CLL patients. This lack of response after AMLC was not due to serum factors or to short-range factors produced by inactivated CLL cells in culture. Possibly AMLC represents a recognition phenomenon between autologous T- and B-cells, and thus it may reflect the interaction of T-helper or suppressor cells and B-lymphocytes. The lack of autorecognition in CLL may reflect the monocional nature of the B-cells in this disease or a defect in helper or suppressor T-cells.","['Smith, J B', 'Knowlton, R P', 'Koons, L S']","['Smith JB', 'Knowlton RP', 'Koons LS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunity', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/58.3.579 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1977 Mar;58(3):579-85. doi: 10.1093/jnci/58.3.579.,,,,,,,,,,

Its biological and biochemical properties are compared with those of chlorozotocin. At a 10% lethal dose (10 mg/kg i.p.), GANU demonstrates minimal myelosuppression. This dose failed to depress normal bone marrow DNA synthesis, in contrast to a 96% inhibition in L1210 DNA synthesis. In L1210 cell suspension, equimolar doses of GANU and chlorozotocin produced equivalent degrees of inhibition in DNA synthesis. GANU has significant L1210 activity in BALB/c X DBA/2 F1 mice treated on Day 2 of tumor growth. A 117% increased life-span and 15% 45-day survivors are atained with 15 mg/kg i.p., a 50% lethal dose. However, in concurrent studies using randomly selected littermate groups of mice, GANU proved less active than chlorozotocin which produced a 306% increased life-span (15 mg/kg i.p.). GANU and chlorozotocin have similar in vitro alkylating activity but the in vitro carbamoylating activity of GANU is sevenfold that of chlorozotocin. On a molar basis, the lethal toxicity of GANU is twice that of chlorozotocin. The significant carbamoylating activity of GANU may contribute to its greater toxicity and therefore limit the mumoles of alkylating agent that can be administered to the tumor. These structure-activity studies further confirm that the addition of a glucose carrier to a cytotoxic nitrosourea moiety can selectively reduce bone marrow toxicity while retaining antitumor activity.","['Fox, P A', 'Panasci, L C', 'Schein, P S']","['Fox PA', 'Panasci LC', 'Schein PS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '3053LTY75Z (chlorozotocin)', '46U771ERWK (Ethyl Chloride)', '58484-07-4 (GANU)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Ethyl Chloride/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Streptozocin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Mar;37(3):783-7.,,,,,,,,,,

This increase, which can be detected by a micronucleus assay for chromosomal damage, was postulated by us to result from a defect in the rejoining system which repairs chromosomal breaks. The postulated defect would result in a longer rejoining time, therapy permitting more movement of broken ends and thus enhancing the frequency of exchanges. To test this possibility, the time required for the rejoining (repair) of chromosome breaks was measured in lymphocytes from five Down's syndrome (four trisomy 21 and one D/G translocation partial trisomy 21) donors, from a monosomy 21 donor, and from five diploid donors. The rejoining time was reduced in the Down's syndrome lymphocytes in comparison to the normal diploid and monosomy 21 lymphocytes. Thus the repair of chromosome breaks, far from being defective as evidenced by a longer rejoining time in Down's syndrome cells, occurred more rapidly than in normal cells. A mechanism is proposed by which reduced rejoining times would increase aberration frequencies as a consequence of competition between a (hypothetical) error-free repair system and the error-prone repair system that generates chromosomal aberrations. We suggest that the alteration in the rejoining of chromosomal aberrations may underlie the increased susceptibility of people with Down's syndrome to leukemia.","['Countryman, P I', 'Heddle, J A', 'Crawford, E']","['Countryman PI', 'Heddle JA', 'Crawford E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', '*DNA Repair', 'Diploidy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'X-Rays']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Jan;37(1):52-8.,,,,,,,,,,

This is chracterized by benign clinical course, poor physical findings, leukopenia and mild anemia in the peripheral blood, and apparent infiltration of abnormal myeloblasts in the bone marrow. Immunological studies of the host defence mechanism were made, because the pathogenesis of its ""smoldering"" course has never been well understood. Nine cases, seen during last 2 years, were investigated for immunological profile, especially the cellular immunity. Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, i.e., tuberculin test, was found to be positive in 8 of 9 cases (88.9%). Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) sensitization test showed to be positive in 4 of 6 cases examined (66.9%). Peripheral lymphocyte balstogenesis by stimulating with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was evaluated using the smear counting method. The blastoid lymphocyte ratio was 55% at the median value (range: 31-68%), compared with 63% in normal young control (age: 25-32) and 41% in normal aged control (age: 60-75). In this report, the cellular immunity in smoldering acute leukemia was proved to be preserved at the normal level and to be more competent than that in aged group. The preserved cellular immunity is considered to explain the phenomenon of ""smoldering"", in other words, the exacerbating proliferation of leukemic cells is suppressed by immuno-surveillance system.","['Toki, H']",['Toki H'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Acta Med Okayama,Acta medica Okayama,0417611,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Tests', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Okayama. 1976 Apr;30(2):125-33.,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms involved were studied in vivo by adoptive transfers into sub-lethally irradiated rats of tumour cells mixed with spleen cells and/or sera from normal, tolerant, or tumour immune rats, and in vitro by a 51Cr release assay involving similar mixtures. The results indicate the presence of a suppression mechanism which is sensitive to irradiation and abolished by trypsinisation. Weak blocking factors can also be detected in serum.

In 1 patient with acute leukemia, 4 with refractory anemia and 1 with acquired dyserythropoiesis the defect of the pyruvate kinase activity was associated with a normal antigen concentration (and, therefore, the molecular specific activity in whole hemolysate was lowered). The enzyme activity was restored by incubation with SH reagents in two cases and by partial purification as often as it was performed. The electrofocusing pattern of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase was normal in both these types of defects. In two patients with so-called ""acquired dyserythropoiesis"" an erythrocyte glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency has been detected; in both the cases it was associated with a parallel decrease of the antigen concentration. The residual enzyme had a normal electrofocusing and electrophoretic pattern and a normal heat stability; the enzyme activity could not be restored by any treatment. In 1 patient with erythroleukemia and in 1 other with acquired dyserythropoiesis the erythrocyte phosphofructokinase activity was lowered. The enzyme activity was not restored by cross incubation in isologous plasma or by the SH reagents. In one case immunologic study could be performed, indicating that the enzyme defect was mainly due to the decreased ratio of the muscle type subunit of the erythrocyte phosphofructokinase. The electrofocusing pattern of deficient phosphofructokinases was normal. Finally, we point out the probable existence of several direct mechanisms, genetic and post translational, accounting for the acquired enzyme defects of red blood cells in various blood disorders.","['Kahn, A', 'Marie, J', 'Bernard, J F', 'Cottreau, D', 'Boivin, P']","['Kahn A', 'Marie J', 'Bernard JF', 'Cottreau D', 'Boivin P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['EC 2.7.1.11 (Phosphofructokinase-1)', 'EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)', 'EC 5.3.1.9 (Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase)']",IM,"['*Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital Nonspherocytic', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/enzymology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/enzymology', 'Erythrocytes/*enzymology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Phosphofructokinase-1/blood/*deficiency', 'Pyruvate Kinase/blood/*deficiency/immunology']",1976/09/20 00:00,1976/09/20 00:01,['1976/09/20 00:00'],"['1976/09/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/09/20 00:01 [medline]', '1976/09/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-8981(76)90088-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-8981(76)90088-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 1976 Sep 20;71(3):379-87. doi: 10.1016/0009-8981(76)90088-7.,,,,,,,,,,

CML leukocyte actin resembled skeletal muscle and other cytoplasmic actins by its subunit molecular weight, by its ability to polymerize in the presence of salts, and to activate the Mg2+-ATPase activity of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin. CML leukocyte myosin was similar to other vertebrate cytoplasmic myosins in having heavy chains and two light subunits. However, its apparent heavy-chain molecular weight and Stokes radius suggested that it was variably degraded during purification. Purified CML leukocyte myosin had average specific EDTA- AND Ca2+-activated ATPase activities of 125 and 151 nmol Pi released/mg protein per min, respectively and low specific Mg2+-ATPase activity. The Mg2+-ATPase activity of CML myosin was increased 200-fold by rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin, but the specific activity relative to that of actin-activated rabbit skeletal muscle myosin was low. CML leukocyte myosin, like other vertebrate cytoplasmic myosins, formed filaments in 0.1 M KCl solutions. Reduced and denatured CML leukocyte-actin-binding protein had a single high molecular weight subunit like a recently described actin-binding protein of rabbit pulmonary macrophages which promotes the polymerization and gelation of actin. Cytoplasmic extracts of CML leukocytes prepared with ice-cold 0.34-M sucrose solutions containing Mg2+-ATP, dithiothreitol, and EDTA at pH 7.0 underwent rapid gelation when warmed to 25 degrees C. Initially, the gel could be liquified by cooling to ice-bath temperature. With time, warmed cytoplasmic extract gels shrunk (""contracted"") into aggregates. The following findings indicated that CML leukocyte actin-binding protein promoted the temperature-dependent gelation of actin in the cytoplasmic extracts and that CML leukocyte myosin was involved in the contraction of the actin gels: (a) Cytoplasmic extract gels initially contained actin as their major polypeptide component and consistent of tangled thin filaments; (b) Contracted aggregates of cytoplasmic extract gels contained by large quantities of myosin as well as actin; (c) Purified actin-binding protein underwent a temperature-dependent, reversible aggregation and caused low concentrations of purified muscle or CML leukocyte actins to gel in sucrose solutions; (d) The gels formed from purified actin plus purified actin-binding protein slowly contracted in the presence but not in the absence of purified CML leukocyte myosin; (e) Rabbit antiserum against purified CML leukocyte actin-binding protein but not against purified CML leukocyte myosin inhibited the gelation of warmed CML leukocyte extracts. Antiserum against CML leukocyte myosin had no effect on the gelation of CML leukocyte extracts but partially curtailed the contraction of the CML leukocyte extract gels and of gels formed from purified CML leukocyte actin-binding protein plus rabbit skeletal muscle actin.","['Boxer, L A', 'Stossel, T P']","['Boxer LA', 'Stossel TP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Actins/*blood/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Blood Proteins/*blood/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myosins/*blood/immunology/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Protein Binding', 'Rabbits']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI108373 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1976 Apr;57(4):964-76. doi: 10.1172/JCI108373.,,,PMC436740,,,,,,,

Age, spleen volume, white blood cell count are in keeping with those found in usual chronic myeloid leukemia (C.M.L.). However, clinical course is more severe with fever, bone pains, and anemia. Myelogibrosis, high circulating basophil polymorphonuclear count, platelet and megacaryocyte abnormalities (in morphology and number) are frequently associated with blastic excess. Subacute myeloid leukemia Ph1 positive (L.M.S. Ph1+) is proposed as an appellation for these cases in order to distinguish them from chronic myelocytic leukemia (C.M.L.) and other subacute myelogytic leukemias. The association of Ph1 chromosome excess of blasts and bone marrow fibrosis distinguishes L.M.S. Ph+ from: 1 degree C.M.L. with myelogibrosis; 2 degrees unusual cases of Ph1 positive myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (M.M.M.); 3 degrees h1 positive acute leukemia. Forms of L.M.S. Ph+ with heavy blastic involvement are probably transitional cases with Ph1 acute myeloblastic leukemia. Prognosis is poorer than in C.M.L. but better than in acute blastic crisis occurring after chronic phase, which can be very similar to L.M.S. Ph1+, when seen for the first time.","['Briere, J', 'Castro-Malaspina, H', 'Tanzer, J', 'Bernard, J']","['Briere J', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Tanzer J', 'Bernard J']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,0401074,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets/abnormalities', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology']",1975/07/01 00:00,1975/07/01 00:01,['1975/07/01 00:00'],"['1975/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1975 Jul-Aug;15(4):407-23.,,Les leucemies myeloides subaegues a chromosome de Philadelphie,,,,,,,,

The u.v.-induced DNA-repair synthesis was followed by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in the presence of hydroxyurea. Similar dose-response curves were established for Down's syndrome leukocytes and controls. The cells from patients with Down's syndrome incorporated 70-75% of the activity of control cells at the various doses (32-196 erg/mm.2). This difference was significant for the two highest u.v.-doses (P less than 0-01). The yield of dicentric chromosomes after X-ray exposure (150 rad.) was 35% higher in Down's syndrome leukocytes than in the control cells (P less than 0-001). Combined u.v. and X-ray irradiation caused a twofold increase in the frequency of dicentric chromosomes in control cells, while the increase was only 27% in Down's syndrome leukocytes. This synergistic effect of u.v. and X-ray irradiation on the yield of dicentric chromosomes suggests that healing of X-ray and u.v.-induced DNA lesions may partly utilize the same repair enzymes. The results also indicate that DNA repair mechanisms are impaired in leukocytes from patients with Down's syndrome, which may contribute to the increased incidence of leukemia and the susceptibility to X-ray irradiation in this disorder.","['Lambert, B', 'Hansson, K', 'Bui, T H', 'Funes-Cravioto, F', 'Lindsten, J']","['Lambert B', 'Hansson K', 'Bui TH', 'Funes-Cravioto F', 'Lindsten J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Hum Genet,Annals of human genetics,0416661,"['VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/*radiation effects', '*DNA Repair/radiation effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes/ultrastructure', '*Radiation Genetics', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'X-Rays']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1469-1809.1976.tb00133.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hum Genet. 1976 Jan;39(3):293-303. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-1809.1976.tb00133.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Report of seven cases.,3-28,"This study reports results from the first clinical tests in which 7 patients with myeloid leukaemia (5 acute and 2 chronic leukaemias in metamorphosis) were treated from 4 to 45 days with granulocyte chalone, the tissue-specific endogenous inhibitor of granulopoiesis. It was observed that i.v. injection of partially purified chalone inhibits proliferation of leukaemic, and presumably also normal granulocytic cells, leaving all other cell types unaffected. Inhibition of leukaemic growth was distinct in 6 of the 7 patients; in 5 cases the inhibition was followed by acutal regression of the leukaemia, lasting up to several months in the absence of any maintenance therapy, and in one case the treatment led to a complete remission. Chalone treatment also resulted in an enhancement of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and in phenomena some of which were totally unexpected, such as immunostimulation and a remarkable resistance to bacterial infections in the presence of extreme granulocytopenia. This study shows that granulocyte chalone is biologically active against myeloid leukaemia in man, but not that the therapeutic value of the impure chalone is superior to modern cytostatic drugs. Long-term therapeutic trials were not possible with the partially purified preparations available, mainly because of side-effects which prevented adequate dosing.","['Rytomaa, T', 'Vilpo, J A', 'Levanto, A', 'Jones, W A']","['Rytomaa T', 'Vilpo JA', 'Levanto A', 'Jones WA']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Scand J Haematol Suppl,Scandinavian journal of haematology.

Within 1 hr after administration of the drug, the levels of guanosine triphosphate, guanosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine diphosphate were reduced, whereas those of inosine monophosphate (IMP) and uridine triphosphate were increased. The most pronounced effects were the lowering of guanine ribonucleotide pools and the elevation of IMP. Aminothiadiazole produced a marked inhibition (approximately 95%) of the incorporation of [8-14C]inosine into guanine nucleotides, whereas only a slight inhibition (approximately 20%) of incorporation into adenine nucleotides was observed. These results suggest that the thiadiazole (or a metabolite thereof) inhibits the conversion of IMP to guanosine monophosphate; this conclusion is reinforced by the observation that mycophenolic acid, a known inhibitor of this conversion, produced effects on ribonucleotide pools similar to those produced by aminothiadiazole. Aminothiadiazole did not inhibit IMP dehydrogenase isolated from L1210 cells. The effects of the thiadiazole on nucleotide pools were prevented by simultaneous administration of nicotinamide. Since nicotinamide is known to prevent or reverse the antileukemic activity of aminothiadiazole, it is probable that the inhibition of synthesis of guanosine monophosphate is related to the antileukemic action of this agent.","['Nelson, J A', 'Rose, L M', 'Bennett, L L']","['Nelson JA', 'Rose LM', 'Bennett LL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Inosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '6L41AOK74P (2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Guanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Inosine/metabolism', 'Inosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Niacinamide/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Thiadiazoles/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Uracil Nucleotides/metabolism']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Apr;36(4):1375-8.,,,,,,,,,,

The granuloma consisted of inflammatory cell infilrations, reactive gliosis, and richly developed blood vessels. The lesions consistently contained numerous characteristic large round cells. In cases of long-survival, the findings included reparative changes, such as extensive gliosis, withdrawal of inflammation, and a decrease in the numbers of large round cells and blood vessels. These lesions were tentatively designated as ""large round cell granuloma."" The early foci of the granoloma were composed of proliferating glial cells and large round cells at the subependymal regions. Electron microscopically these large round cells had abundant intracytoplasmic fibrils quite similar to gliofibrils. Numerous C-type virus particles were present in the intercellular nad perivascular spaces, and occasionally budded from cell membranes of the large round cells and vascular endothelia. The large round cells were considered to be reactive astrocytes activated by biral infection. It was conclided that MSV-M was not a sarcomogenic but a granulomogenic virus in mice.

The leukemia cells migrate into the Disse spaces from the sinusoids. The leukemic cells penetrate with cytoplasmic digitations between connected endothelial cells. There is no lytic disintegration of the endothelial cells. The leukemic cells multiply by mitotic division of the Disse spaces, thereby compressing the liver cells. The cell membranes of both cell-types remain intact. Electronmicroscopically no evidence is found of a secretion of enzymes from the leukemia cells that destroy liver cells. Destruction of the liver cells is the consequence of the growth-pressure exerted by the dividing leukemic cells. Within the liver of the recipients the leukemic cells produce RNA-viruses. In the cytoplasm - frequently in the area of the Golgi-field - groups of immature A-particles are formed. In the virus fields the ribosomes disappear. The immature A-particles consist of two concentric electron dense shells. On the surface of the liver cells budding particles and immature C-particles develop.

Patients with Hodgkin's disease tend to have depressed responses to both newly encountered and recall antigens. Patients with solid tumors are more likely to be deficient only in the response to newly encountered antigens. In patients who have intact response to recall antigens, reactivity to antigen preparations from tumor and control tissue may be studied. Tumor-associated or organ-associated antigens have been demonstrated by delayed hypersensitivity responses in leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, malignant melanoma and carcinoma of the lung, breast, cervix uteri and intestine. Approaches to a definition of the specificity of these reactions are described. The results with these tumor antigen tests correlate strongly with the clinical course. This is a promising technique for monitoring immunotherapy. The results from tests with recall and newly encountered antigens also correlate with the clinical status and perhaps with prognosis. Various possible interpretations of these changes are discussed. Further work should be directed toward an exact definition of immunologic defects in patients with cancer and toward the use of this understanding for a rational program of immunotherapy.","['Burdick, J F', 'Wells, S A Jr', 'Herberman, R B']","['Burdick JF', 'Wells SA Jr', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Surg Gynecol Obstet,"Surgery, gynecology & obstetrics",0101370,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dinitrochlorobenzene)']",IM,"['Antigens', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Arthus Reaction/immunology', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Carcinoma/immunology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Dinitrochlorobenzene/immunology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology', 'Humans', '*Hypersensitivity, Delayed', 'Immunity', 'Intradermal Tests/*methods', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Skin Tests/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",1975/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/11/01 00:00'],"['1975/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Surg Gynecol Obstet. 1975 Nov;141(5):779-94.,163,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for the deposition of immune complexes in the kidney was obtained by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, as well as by immuno-electrophoretic analysis of kidney elutions. Tests with antiserum reagent against Moloney leukemia virus antigen revealed its presence in some but not all glomeruli. The presence of other viruses in Moloney leukemia virus negative glomeruli was not ruled out. Serum autoantibody against an array of rat tissues could not be detected. Therefore, it would appear that autoimmune mechanism may not be the primary underlying cause of pathogenesis of the disease. Accordingly, the disease could be referred to as chronic immune complex glomerulonephropathy with nephrotic syndrome, but sources of the antigens in the complex were mostly unknown, althougn virus could be one portion of them.

Following this first mitotic peak no futher peak of neither the mitotic nor the labeling index was observed during 48 hrs in L 1210 ascites tumor cells and during 38 hrs in crypt epithelia. Thus, in both cell types it was not possible to obtain a synchronizing effect by applying vincristine. Based on cell kinetic considerations it was examined whether peaks of the mitotic as well as the labeling index can be expected at all under the given circumstances. The results show that the theoretical course of the mitotic index coincides with the measured values. This means that no peak of the mitotic index can be expected from the theoretical point of view. In calculating the time course of the labeling index the theoretical curve proved to depend to a high degree on the variations of the cycle time which are not known in detail, especially not after application of vincristine.

Epidemiologic investigations revealed that clinically healthy HBsAg carriers, the ""carrier"" status in immunodeficiency syndromes and the natural circulation of the hepatitis B virus are of major interest. The demonstration of HBsAg enables us to characterize some diseases which show associations to hepatitis B virus, but where the pathogenic role of HBsAg/Ab immunocomplexes is questionable.

The neoplastic cells of these disorders have membrane features of thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes, a characteristic tissue distribution (skin infiltration, marrow sparing, localization in T-cell regions of lymphoid tissue), and distinctive morphology. For these reasons, we suggest that these lymphoproliferative disorders be grouped together as ""cutaneous T-cell lymphomas"". The anergy noted in patients of this group with leukemia probably is related to both decreased percentages of normal T cells and presence in the serum of macrophage migration inhibitory activity. Leukapheresis has been particularly effective in the management of selected patients. The homogeneous T-cell populations in the patients with leukemia also provide important opportunities to study many aspects of lymphocyte physiology that are of broad biologic significance.","['Lutzner, M', 'Edelson, R', 'Schein, P', 'Green, I', 'Kirkpatrick, C', 'Ahmed, A']","['Lutzner M', 'Edelson R', 'Schein P', 'Green I', 'Kirkpatrick C', 'Ahmed A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Cell Membrane/pathology', '*Dermatitis, Exfoliative/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Keratoderma, Palmoplantar/blood/immunology/pathology', '*Lymphatic Diseases/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mycosis Fungoides/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Syndrome', '*T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1975/10/01 00:00,1975/10/01 00:01,['1975/10/01 00:00'],"['1975/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-83-4-534 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1975 Oct;83(4):534-52. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-83-4-534.,,,,,,,,,,

The total urinary GAG were isolated by precipitation with cetyltrimethyl-ammoniumbromide (CTAB), and assayed in terms of their hexuronic acid content. A statistically highly significant increase in the excretion of total GAG was observed in all the disorders studied, except Hodgkin's disease, the highest value being seen in myeloid leukaemia (ML). Constant amounts of non-dialysable urinary GAG were electrophoresed in 0.5 M lithium acetate on cellulose acetate strips, and stained with alcian blue. The densitometric tracing derived from the electrophoresis strips were analysed with a Du Pont Curve Resolver. The electrophoretic data suggested the existence of a qualitative deviation in GAG excretion in CLL and in MF, in that patients with these diseases excreted on an average larger than normal amounts of slowly migrating GAG fractions. Pooled crude urinary GAG material from patients with CLL, MF, AML and CML and from control subjects was further purified and subjected to analytical studies. These indicated that a similar qualitative urinary GAG distribution exists in ML and in controls, whereas the urinary GAG in CLL and MF patients contained relatively more dermatan sulphate (DS, in terms of iduronate) than those of the controls.","['Friman, C', 'Juvani, M']","['Friman C', 'Juvani M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Sweden,Acta Med Scand,Acta medica Scandinavica,0370330,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Cetrimonium Compounds)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Hexuronic Acids)']",IM,"['Carbazoles/urine', 'Cetrimonium Compounds', 'Electrophoresis', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*urine', 'Hexuronic Acids/urine', 'Hodgkin Disease/urine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*urine', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/urine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/urine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/urine', 'Lymphoma/*urine', 'Multiple Myeloma/urine', 'Mycosis Fungoides/urine']",1975/07/01 00:00,1975/07/01 00:01,['1975/07/01 00:00'],"['1975/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.0954-6820.1975.tb19514.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Scand. 1975 Jul-Aug;198(1-2):115-22. doi: 10.1111/j.0954-6820.1975.tb19514.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-six patients less than 60 years old (median age: 44 years) presenting with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia were entered to the study. Sixteen achieved complete remission (C.R.), i.e. 44% of the whole and 53% of treated patients. Out of 16 patients with complete remission, 4 relapsed during the observation period which lasted 4-1/2 years. The stability of the hematologic equilibrium in patients in C.R. is the main finding of the present study. The actuarial curve of the duration of the first complete remission reaches a ""plateau""; after the 8th month only one relapse was observed in 9 patients. The rate of C.R. at 2 years is 76 +/- 23%. As compared to the results from other schedules of treatment, this rate appears significantly better, specially in the case of immunotherapy (p less than 0,001).

Two methods were utilized simultaneously: the measurement of the incorporation of 3H-TdR by liquid scintillation counting and the labeling index by autoradiography. These two data allowed to appreciate the mean incorporation per labeled blast cell. A significant correlation has been found between liquid scintillation counting and labeling index on the one hand, between mean incorporation per labeled blast cell and mean grain count on the other hand. The prognostic value of these different data was significant, at least if one consider the chance to get a complemente remission with the various drugs which were utilized. The responders are characterized, on the average, by a high rate of incorporation of 3H-TdR before therapy, with a higher labeling index than the non-responders. The measurement of the variations of incorporation of 3H-TdR, 48 hours after starting chemotherapy and before any morphological change, allows an early evaluation of the therapeutic effect: in the responders there is generally a decrease of the 3H-TdR incorporation and of the labeling index. On the apposite in the non-responders there is an increase of the mean incorporation per labeled blast cell, even if the labeling index decreases. The measurement of the incorporation of 3H-TdR by liquid scintillation counting which gives an earlier response than autoradiography, may be considered as a useful prognostic tool in acute leukemia, mainly in the non-lymphoblastic types and during the first phase of the disease.","['Zittoun, R', 'Bouchard, M', 'Facquet-Danis, J', 'Percie-du-Sert, M', 'Bousser, J']","['Zittoun R', 'Bouchard M', 'Facquet-Danis J', 'Percie-du-Sert M', 'Bousser J']",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,0401074,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Autoradiography/methods', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Scintillation Counting/methods', 'Thymidine/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1975 Jan-Feb;15(1):19-30.,,"Incorporation ""in vitro"" de la thymidine tritiee dans la leucemie aigue et reponse a la chimiotherapie",,,,,,,,

An immunodepleting and immunosuppressive disorder.,467-75,"Irradiated leukocytes or mononuclear leukocytes, from 16 out of 30 patients with Hodgkin's disease and from one patient with the Sezary syndrome, stimulated in culture subnormal (3H)thymidine incorporation by allogeneic lymphocytes from normal individuals. This abnormality was not demonstrated in any of 30 other patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Subnormal mixed leukocyte culture reaction activation was caused by suppression of the mixed leukocyte reaction by patients' cells. Inhibition of the reaction by patient mononuclear leukocytes was corrected when adherent cells were removed or when protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide. The inhibitory cells were probably lymphocytes since selective removal of phagocytic cells did not remove the inhibition by other patient mononuclear leukocytes. The presence in culture of as few as 2,500 granulocytes per mm3 also reduced responses when target cells were from patients with Hodgkin's disease. Patient cells no longer suppressed the mixed leukocyte reaction after patients entered clinical remission which suggests that suppression is a reversible, disease-related abnormality. Thus, the immune deficiency with advance Hodgkin's disease caused by ly lymphocyte depletion may be compounded by a relative excess of suppressor lymphocytes. The overall immunodeficiency may be further compounded by suppression of immune response by granulocytes at even physiologic concentrations.","['Twomey, J J', 'Laughter, A H', 'Farrow, S', 'Douglass, C C']","['Twomey JJ', 'Laughter AH', 'Farrow S', 'Douglass CC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Dermatitis, Exfoliative/immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Thymidine', 'Tritium']",1975/08/01 00:00,1975/08/01 00:01,['1975/08/01 00:00'],"['1975/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI108113 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1975 Aug;56(2):467-75. doi: 10.1172/JCI108113.,,,PMC436607,,,,,,,

A linear relationship between log cell dose and survival time was established for the range of unirradiated cell doses between 10-8 to ""10-0"", resulting in survival times from 6 to 16 days, with very little variation between individual animals of each group. This narrow deviation of survival time makes it possible to use mean survival time as a measuring parameter instead of the cell dose required to kill 50 percent of recipient animals. From the longer survival times observed after transfer of a given number of X-irradiated cells, the number of viable cells transferred in the inoculum could be calculated and thus the degree of cell death due to X-radiation. Agains a correlation between log cell dose and survival time was found but host survival was prolonged when small numbers (similar to 10-2) of viable irradiated cells were transferred. It is suggested that this is not due to a change in proliferation kinetics but rather to host factors, such as an immunological reaction. Thus the L 5222 leukaemia seems to be a good model in its reproducibility of survival time, and may have some similarity to human acute leukaemia when low numbers of treated cells are concerned.","['Hoelzer, D', 'Harriss, E B']","['Hoelzer D', 'Harriss EB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Z Krebsforsch Klin Onkol Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Zeitschrift fur Krebsforschung und klinische Onkologie.

Evidence for myeloperoxidase-linked and myeloperoxidase-independent candidacidal mechanisms.,338-46,"We tested the ability of human peripheral blood monocytes to kill Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. Evidence that multiple fungicidal mechanisms operate in normla monocytes was found. Normal monocytes ingested and killed viable C. albicans, and could iodinate heat-killed C. albicans. Both functions were defective in monocytes from subjects with myeloperoxidase deficiency or chronic granulomatous disease. Methimazole, isoniazid, and aminotriazole inhibited iodination by normal monocytes without impairing their ability to kill C. albicans, indicating that iodination was not essential to the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-mediated fungicidal system of the monocyte. C. parapsilosis, an organism killed with supranormal efficacy by monocytes from a patient with hereditary myeloperoxidase deficiency, was selected to examine the myeloperoxidase-independent fungicidal mechanisms of monocytes. Monocytes were obtained from the blood of normal or leukemic subjects and homogenized in 0.34 M sucrose to yield fractions rich in cytoplasmic granules. These fractions were extracted with 0.01 M citric acid and the soluble components were separated by micropreparative polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Monocytes were found to contain cationic proteins, other than myeloperoxidase, that kill C. parapsilosis in vitro.","['Lehrer, R I']",['Lehrer RI'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Iodides)', '554Z48XN5E (Methimazole)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'V83O1VOZ8L (Isoniazid)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', '*Candida/drug effects', 'Candida albicans/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granuloma/blood', 'Humans', 'Iodides/metabolism', 'Isoniazid/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/blood', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Methimazole/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/microbiology', 'Peroxidases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Subcellular Fractions']",1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI107937 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1975 Feb;55(2):338-46. doi: 10.1172/JCI107937.,,,PMC301752,,,,,,,

These studies might help to resolve the controversy about the nature of the stimulating cells and to offer some insight into the mechanism of the stimulation in the MLR. The significant observations from this study are summarized as follows: (1) Stimulatory capacity of CLL lymphocytes was intact or increased, while their responding capacity was markedly depressed. (2) In our group of patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease, both stimulating and responding capacities were imparied. (3) In these patients a correlation existed between the degree of stimulatory capacity and production of a blastogenic factor. This observation would raise the possibility that the production of a blostogenic factor may in some way be involved in the stimulation of responding lymphocytes in mixed cultures. Our results, which show a dichotomy between MLC stimulatory and responding capacities of CLL lymphocyte, may suggest that different factors are involved in stimulation and response.","['Kasakura, S']",['Kasakura S'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Hodgkin Disease/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphokines', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium']",1975/06/01 00:00,1975/06/01 00:01,['1975/06/01 00:00'],"['1975/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73523-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1975 Jun;45(6):823-32.,,,,,,,,,,

Blood, marrow, and thymus cells from normal individuals and patients with lymphoproliferative disorders were examined. Samples were fixed before exposure to specific reagents. Normal lymphocyts with detectable sIg, i.e. B lymphocytes, were characterized by a villous surface; nonlabeled blood lymphocytes and thymocytes were smooth cells. Intermediate cells were also found which in sections appeared moderately villous and labeled, thus identified as B lymphocytes. Further evidence for a relationship between villous surface and sIg was given by the finding of a few lymphocytes with polar concentration of labeled microvilli. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, most cells exhibited a villous surface with parallel variations of the number of microvilli and of anti-immunoglobulin-binding capacity. However, some labeled smooth blastic cells were also observed. On the other hand, abnormal lymphocytes from Sezary's syndrome which could exhibit segments of villous membrane had no detectable sIg. This study confirms that in most cases human B lymphocytes have a characteristic surface appearance and that the detection of sIg in normal lymphocytes correlates with the presence of microvilli.","['Lejonc, R J', 'Gourdin, M F', 'Mannoni, P', 'Dreyfus, B', 'Reyes, F']","['Lejonc RJ', 'Gourdin MF', 'Mannoni P', 'Dreyfus B', 'Reyes F']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Keratoderma, Palmoplantar/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Lymphatic Diseases/blood', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Peroxidases', 'Syndrome', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.141.2.392 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1975 Feb 1;141(2):392-410. doi: 10.1084/jem.141.2.392.,,,PMC2190536,,,,,,,

From the present study, the suppressor cells appeared to be macrophages since they were radioresistant, inactivated by carrageenan, and removed by adherence columns and an iron/magnet technique. We have also found that suppressor cells were still fully active when added 16 hr after the mitogen, thus indicating that early mitogen-induced changes were not the target of suppressive action. It appeared that suppressor cells inhibited metabolic events related to the initiation of DNA synthesis and that they had a selective effect on proliferation-dependent lymphocyte effector functions. PHA-induced cytotoxic reactivity which in our system is largely independent of DNA synthesis was not depressed but actually enhanced in MSV spleens. Cytotoxicity of MSV spleen cells against syngeneic lymphoma cells was unaffected by suppressor cells whereas lymphocytes stimulation by mitomycin C-treated syngeneic lymphoma cellls was inhibited. MSV spleen cells also inhibited DNA synthesis of cultured murine lymphoma cells. This function was only slightly diminished after treatment with anti-omicron serum plus guinea pig complement. Furthermore, spleen cells from MSV tumor-bearing nude mice were as effective as spleen cells from their heterozygous littermates, thus suggesting that T lymphocytes are not the main effector cells of inhibition of lymphoma cell DNA synthesis. The inhibitor cells were radioresistnant, inactivated by carrageenan, and removed by adherence columns and the iron/magnet technique. These data strongly suggest that the inihibitor cells of lymphoma cell DNA synthesis are macrophages and that they belong to the same group of cells as the suppressor cells of PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation.","['Kirchner, H', 'Muchmore, A V', 'Chused, T M', 'Holden, H T', 'Herberman, R B']","['Kirchner H', 'Muchmore AV', 'Chused TM', 'Holden HT', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Lectins)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Lectins', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/abnormalities', 'Tritium']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1975 Jan;114(1 Pt 1):206-10.,,,,,,,,,,

Striking oscillations of the colony and cluster formation occurred also during remission with or without maintenance therapy, but with a longer periodicity as compared sto the phase of induction of remission.

The results were compared with retro- and prospective investigations of patients of the Kiel lymphoma study group. The aim of the study is to evaluate the value of the Kiel classification for the therapy and prognosis of malignant lymphomas. The malignant lymphomas of low- and high-grade malignancy differ significantly in their biological behaviour. Especially the clinical progress of the disease and the response to therapy are different. The lymphomas of low-grade malignancy may not need any treatment for long periods in some patients. In contrary, patients with lymphomas of high-grade malignancy need an active treatment immediately after the establishment of the diagnosis. In stages I and II radiotherapy is sufficient, in stages III and IV chemotherapeutic regimens are necessary. Each type of malignant lymphoma may be accompanied by leukemia. Most of the malignant lymphomas, particularly the immunocytomas, may produce monoclonal gammopathies, most of them being macroglobulinemias. Thus the macroglobulinemia Waldenstrom is just a clinical necessary to evaluate the significance of the subtypes of the Kiel classification for the planning of specific treatment.","['Stacher, A', 'Heinz, R', 'Waldner, R']","['Stacher A', 'Heinz R', 'Waldner R']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/pathology']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1979;49(8):715-30.,,Klinik der Nicht-Hodgkin-Lymphome nach der Kieler Klassifikation.,,,,,,,,

The reactive nature of the plasma cells of HCL was suggested by the fact that there was no restriction of light-chain expression, although viable hairy cells were shown to express monoclonal surface immunoglobulin. This, together with the absence by both light and electron microscopy of forms intermediate between hairy cells and plasma cells and the lack of ribosome-lamella complexes in the plasma cells, suggested that hairy cells do not differentiate into plasma cells. Although hairy cells are known to contain immunoglobulin, this was not demonstrable in hairy cells in the paraffin-embedded tissue.

Three in vitro growth patterns were observed: markedly decreased or no growth in 4 cases, extensive growth of granulocytic colonies in 2 cases, and extensive growth of macrophage colonies in the remaining 2. It is suggested that the marrows presenting diminished or no growth patterns are presumably of acute myelogenous leukemia patients with a monocytic component. The excessive granulocytic or macrophage colony growth may be an in vitro indication for an in vivo proliferation of either granulocytic or monocytic leukemic cell lines, and therefore may represent the Naegeli or Schilling variants of AMML respectively.

Considering the total patient group, age and white blood count at diagnosis had no significance in predicting relapse. Of relapse events in males, 21% were isolated testicular relapses, identifying the testicles as a major risk site in males completing three years of continuous complete remission. This study demonstrates that continuing chemotherapy beyond three years results in a significant prolongation of remission in males, although the eventual survival outcome for later discontinuance of therapy will require longer follow-up.","['Baum, E', 'Sather, H', 'Nachman, J', 'Seinfeld, J', 'Krivit, W', 'Leikin, S', 'Miller, D', 'Joo, P', 'Hammond, D']","['Baum E', 'Sather H', 'Nachman J', 'Seinfeld J', 'Krivit W', 'Leikin S', 'Miller D', 'Joo P', 'Hammond D']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Long-Term Care', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Sex Factors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950070106 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1979;7(1):25-34. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950070106.,,,,,,,,,,

They were demonstrated to be enzymatically hydrolyzed to the corresponding steroid and ara-CMP and the latter was further shown to be hydrolyzed to ara-C by phosphodiesterase I, snake venom, 5'-nucleotidase, and acid phosphatase. However, the conjugates were shown to be resistant to hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase. The activity of conjugates I and II against L1210 lymphoid leukemia in female mice (C3D2F1/J) was significantly greater than that of ara-C alone or in combination with the steroid. In fact, when the optimum dosage of 75 (mumol/kg)/day x 5 was used, the administration of ara-C alone was followed by an increased life span (ILS) of 45%. This result is similar to that previously reported. With the same equimolar doses of mixtures of ara-C and either prednisolone or prednisone, the ILS values were 40 and 44%, respectively.

In vitro C deposition by immune complex formation with normal human lymphocytes enhanced Mk rosette formation, and this could be inhibited with antiserum to C 3. The use of Mk rosette formation revealed that cells from a wide variety of human lymphoid and myeloid leukemias carry membrane-bound C. It was also shown that several lymphoblastoid cell lines, including a T cell line, probably synthesize both C 3 and C 4.

The binding appears to be specific, since we could demonstrate the release of viral RNA from polyribosomes with EDTA. Moreover, when infection occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, most viral RNA molecules were detected in the free cytoplasm. Size analysis on polyribosomal viral RNA molecules indicated that two size class molecules, 38S and 23S, are present in polyribosomes at 3 h after infection. Analysis of the polyriboadenylate [poly(rA)] content of viral RNA extracted from infected polyribosomes demonstrated that such molecules bind with greatest abundance at 3 h after infection, as has been detected with total viral RNA. No molecules lacking poly(rA) stretches could be detected in polyribosomes. Furthermore, when a similar analysis was performed on unbound molecules present in the free cytoplasm, identical results were obtained. We conclude that no selection towards poly(rA)-containing viral molecules is evident on binding to polyribosomes. These findings suggest that the incoming viral genome of the Moloney strain of murine leukemia virus may serve as a messenger for the synthesis of one or more virus-specific proteins early after infection of mouse fibroblasts.","['Shurtz, R', 'Dolev, S', 'Aboud, M', 'Salzberg, S']","['Shurtz R', 'Dolev S', 'Aboud M', 'Salzberg S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*analysis/metabolism', 'Poly A/analysis', 'Polyribosomes/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis/metabolism']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.31.3.668-676.1979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1979 Sep;31(3):668-76. doi: 10.1128/JVI.31.3.668-676.1979.,,,PMC353495,,,,,,,

Identification of virus and cell surface antigens in situ has been accomplished in indirect reactions by unconjugated markers. Hemocyanin (Hcy) from whelk, Busycon canniculatum, has been developed as an immunospecific marker for virion and cell surface labeling in the electron microscope. Its size (30 x 50 nm) and distinct cylindrical shape permit easy visualization in the SEM and the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The Hcy method involves the preparation of antisera to Hcy in appropriate hosts for use in an unlabeled antibody macromolecule procedure based exclusively on antigen-antibody affinity to couple the macromolecule to the antigen site. Further correlative data from fluorescence microscopy can be obtained from similarly labeled samples by binding fluorescein to the bridging antibodies used in the Hcy technique. The usefulness of the Hcy marker system was demonstrated by employing highly specific antisera to the major envelope and cell surface glycoprotein (gp70) of Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV), a type C retrovirus. The antiserum was shown to bind to the virion and cell surfaces of virus-infected cells in the homologous virus-infected cell system. It also demonstrated the expression of R-MuLV gp70-related antigens on a murine cell line Mm5mt/c1 which produces mouse mammary tumor virus (MuMTV), a type B retrovirus. Furthermore, when used in the Hcy marker system the anti-gp70 serum was able to distinguish type B from type C budding virus on the same cell. Methods for the preparation of immunoreagents and labeling of cells are discussed.","['Gonda, M A', 'Gilden, R V', 'Hsu, K C']","['Gonda MA', 'Gilden RV', 'Hsu KC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Hemocyanins', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Retroviridae/*analysis', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/27.11.117048 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1979 Nov;27(11):1445-54. doi: 10.1177/27.11.117048.,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with MF and CML, mean activities of the lipoxygenase pathway were significantly lower when compared with normal controls (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively). When a normal range of the activity was defined as mean +/- 2 SD, all patients with MF, 8 with CML, 6 with PV, and 1 with ET showed decreased lipoxygenase activities, while activities of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway were decreased in one of each patient with CML, PV, and ET.

Among the members of this family, represented by the V(kappa)21 group of plasmacytomas, are examples in which six different germ-line V genes are joined to four different J segments in various combinations. The mRNA precursors were identified by hybridizing a cloned kappa-cDNA probe to poly(A)-containing nuclear RNAs that were size fractionated on methylmercury-agarose gels and transferred to diazotized paper. Based on the length of the segment excised in the last detectable processing step, which presumably represents the removal of the J-C intron, the precursor patterns were classified into four primary categories that correlated well with the type of J segment being expressed. The J segments were thus located at distances ranging from 2.4 to 4.8 kilobases from the constant-region gene. Different V genes joined to the same J segment exhibited similar precursor patterns, suggesting that the size of the translocated V segment may be relatively uniform among members of the V(kappa)21 group. A large (9.1 kilobases) component, which is likely to represent a primary transcription product, was observed in all processing categories, regardless of which J segment was being utilized. This surprising observation leads to some interesting predictions about the mechanism of V-J translocation.","['Perry, R P', 'Kelley, D E', 'Schibler, U']","['Perry RP', 'Kelley DE', 'Schibler U']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myeloma Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Precursors/*genetics', 'Plasmacytoma/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.8.3678 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Aug;76(8):3678-82. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.8.3678.,,,PMC383896,,,,,,,

In an experiment reported here, in female Sprague-Dawley rats, using the same doses of DMBA and phorbol and the same injection schedule, phorbol given after DMBA did not augment mammary adenocarcinoma incidence or lymphatic leukemia incidence as compared to DMBA given alone. It thus appears that there is a strain-related sensitivity between Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats with regard to the promoting activity of phorbol when phorbol treatment follows DMBA treatment, and mammary adenocarcinoma incidence and lymphatic leukemia incidence are studied. Further, in Sprague-Dawley rats, phorbol did not promote mammary fibroadenoma incidence in DMBA-treated rats, mammary adenocarcinoma incidence in procarbazine-treated rats, and mammary adenocarcinoma incidence or mammary fibroadenoma incidence in X-ray-treated rats. DMBA and procarbazine, with or without phorbol, tended to induce more mammary neoplasms in the anterior (thoracic) than in the posterior (abdominal) mammary glands. X-irradiation tended to induce mammary neoplasms in approximately equal numbers in the anterior and posterior mammary glands. It was suggested that regional differences in chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis were due to a difference in the transport and delivery of the chemical carcinogens to the regions rather than a difference in the amount of mammary gland tissue in the regions. An analysis of the numbers of Sprague-Dawley rats that developed either no mammary neoplasms, or only mammary adenocarcinomas, or only mammary fibroadenomas, or both mammary adenocarcinomas and mammary fibroadenomas in response to DMBA, procarbazine, and X-ray, suggested that the development of a mammary adenocarcinoma or the development of a mammary fibroadenoma are independent processes.","['Shellabarger, C J', 'Holtzman, S', 'Stone, J P']","['Shellabarger CJ', 'Holtzman S', 'Stone JP']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phorbols)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Adenocarcinoma/chemically induced', 'Adenofibroma/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/chemically induced', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Procarbazine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'X-Rays']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1979 Sep;39(9):3345-8.,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was entering a blastic phase at the time of the most detailed studies. Cytological, cytochemical, and ultrastructural studies revealed a mixed myeloid proliferation with granulocytic forms predominating over monocytic elements. A variety of ultrastructural abnormalities, including defective granulation, was observed but no cells with highly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum were observed. Immunological marker studies showed that the mature myeloid cells possessed receptors for the Fc of IgG and weakly expressed the Ia-like P29/34 antigen. The mature myeloid cells also expressed both surface and intracytoplasmic Ig restricted to IgG K, and this IgG K persisted after 4 weeks in culture. A reverse plaque assay showed that the myeloid cells were capable of releasing IgG K in vitro, but studies involving the incorporation of radio-labeled amino acids showed no detectable Ig production by the myeloid cells. The possible interpretations of these data are discussed in some detail in relation to previous reports of paraproteinemia in myeloid proliferative disorders.","['Barnard, D L', 'Burns, G F', 'Gordon, J', 'Cawley, J C', 'Barker, C R', 'Hayhoe, F G', 'Smith, J L']","['Barnard DL', 'Burns GF', 'Gordon J', 'Cawley JC', 'Barker CR', 'Hayhoe FG', 'Smith JL']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin G', '*Immunoglobulin Light Chains', '*Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Fc']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197909)44:3<927::aid-cncr2820440321>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1979 Sep;44(3):927-36. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197909)44:3<927::aid-cncr2820440321>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,

Six patients with benign monoclonal gammopathy, one with amyloidosis of immunoglobulin origin, and two with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia had normal karyotypes. All six MM patients with aneuploidy were in a group of 10 patients in an accelerated or relapse phase of their disease and four had high serum paraprotein levels (7.92, 6.24, 6.80, and 4.24 g/dl, respectively) when their abnormal karyotypes were detected. Five of the 6 MM patients with aneuploidy had received prior chemotherapy. Aneuploidy was not observed in 8 stable MM patients. Abnormalities of chromosome 14 were present in all 6 patients, with a 14q+ marker in 5 and loss of No. 14 in 1. A translocation between Nos. 11 and 14 was found in aneuploid cells of 2 patients who had plasma cell leukemia (PCL). However, the break point in the long arm of No. 11 differed in the 2 patients. A gain of Nos. 5, 9, and 11 was seen in 3 patients, a gain of No 1 in 2, and rearrangements of No. 1 in 5 MM patients, including all 4 who had a 14q+ marker chromosome initially. A deletion of chromosome 6 at band q25 was detected in 2 MM patients and a pericentric inversion of No. 6 (6p21 to 6q13) was seen in the patient with PCL. Three of 4 MM patients had a nonrandom loss of one chromosome 8. Two other MM patients, who were treated with melphalan and prednisone, developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) 2+ and 4+ years after the diagnosis of MM. Marrow cells of one patient showed a 5q- chromosome and a constitutional translocation involving Nos. 13 and 14 during the preleukemic stage; during the leukemic phase, the karyotype evolved to 50 chromosomes including extra chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 10, and 21 and a missing 7, in addition to the originally detected 5q- and the 13/14 translocation. The peripheral blood from the other patient was hypodiploid, with a missing chromosome 7 and a translocation between 3q and 9p. These patterns of chromosome change resemble those of ANLL rather than MM and are similar to the changes seen in ANLL after treated malignant lymphoma.","['Liang, W', 'Hopper, J E', 'Rowley, J D']","['Liang W', 'Hopper JE', 'Rowley JD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amyloidosis/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 1-3', '*Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Paraproteinemias/*genetics', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/genetics']",1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197908)44:2<630::aid-cncr2820440233>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1979 Aug;44(2):630-44. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197908)44:2<630::aid-cncr2820440233>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far, only the virus neutralization antibody (VNA) test, the immunofluorescence test, and the immunodiffusion test with the major internal virion protein have been critically evaluated as diagnostic methods for the identification of BLV-infected cattle. Of these tests, the VNA test is the most sensitive and specific. Therefore, in the present study the VNA test has been applied to evaluate the reliability of the radioimmunoassay for BLV p25 (RIAp25) and of the immunodiffusion test with BLV-associated glycoprotein antigen (IDgp). The results show a very close agreement between the RIAp25, and the VNA test. The IDgp test is less sensitive than the RIAp25, particularly for the detection of BLV antibodies in early stages of infection. The RIAp25 is more rapid than the VNA test and does not require tissue culture techniques. Thus, the RIAp25 seems to be the most practical and sensitive available method for the serolgical diagnosis of BLV infection in cattle.","['Gupta, P', 'Ferrer, J F']","['Gupta P', 'Ferrer JF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Ann Rech Vet,Annales de recherches veterinaires.

Moreover, the fact that combined inoculations of Con-A-bound vaccine, assumed to be blastogenic to T cells, with anti-thymocyte sera, but not with cyclophosphamide or carrageenan, resulted in reduced production of resistant animals was also consistent with, but not proving, this possibility.

Effects of ionizing radiations on the embryon and foetus (author's transl)].,155-64,"In man, the period of maximum risk for the embryo and foetus is between the second and tenth week after conception. The most frequent and most severe malformation is microcephaly which in extreme cases is accompanied by mental retardation. The results of studies in experimental animals and man agree that it is impossible to demonstrate any increased risk of malformation with doses below 15 rads, and that the increase over the spontaneous incidence of malformation is slight at doses below 25 rads. A very small increase in the frequency of leukaemias and cancers has been observed after irradiation in utero for pelvimetry, which delivers a few rads; it can be estimated from these data that a dose of 2 rads induces at the most the risk of one case of cancer in 2,000 children. In practice, it is only exceptionally that an abortion is advised after a diagnostic radiological examination, since the doses in these circumstances are relatively low. A therapeutic termination of pregnancy should be advised when the dose is greater than 20 rads, but it is necessary to take into account other medico-social factors. Conversely, it is important to avoid any irradiation in women who could be pregnant and in particular avoid any irradiation of the true pelvis during the 10 days prior to menses and especially if there has been a delay in the start of menstruation. In pregnant women radiological examinations should only be made if they are of paramount importance for the mother, and all precautions taken to reduce the dose to the uterus in the absolute minimum.","['Tubiana, M']",['Tubiana M'],['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Bone Diseases, Developmental/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*radiation effects', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/etiology', 'Fetus/*radiation effects', 'Growth Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Mice', 'Microcephaly/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radiography/adverse effects', 'Rats']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1979;66(2):155-64.,,Problemes poses par l'irradiation des femmes enceintes.

Thus, AKR SL3 cells were not lysed nor were EL4 cells (H-2(b); but only weakly positive for gp70). Cells not bearing the MuLV antigens tested for, such as P815 mastocytoma cells and spleen cell ""blasts"" from C57BL/6 and CBA (H-2(k)) mice, were also insusceptible to attack. The cytotoxic effector cells induced bore Thy 1.2 alloantigen and were of the Lyt 1+2+ phenotype. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the conclusion that the cytotoxic T cells raised against E{male}G2 are directed against AKR/Gross virus-associated antigens and are H-2 restricted. It will be of interest to determine the relevance of such effector cells to the known resistance of the C57BL/6 mouse to AKR/Gross virus-induced leukemia.","['Green, W R', 'Nowinski, R C', 'Henney, C S']","['Green WR', 'Nowinski RC', 'Henney CS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.150.1.51 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1979 Jul 1;150(1):51-66. doi: 10.1084/jem.150.1.51.,,,PMC2185612,,,,,,,

Similarly, absorption of the suppressor factor with anti-Iad antiserum removed the suppressive properties of the material.

A new binding assay for TMP synthetase allows detection of 0.005 pmol of enzyme. The quantitative enzymatic conversion of dUMP to [methyl-(14)C]-TMP using 5,10-methylene[(14)C]tetrahydrofolate by pure L. casei TMP synthetase is used as an assay for dUMP with a sensitivity of 10 pmol.

Preincubation of NK cells with detergent-solubilized cell-surface proteins of YAC lymphoma cells prevented subsequent binding to intact YAC targets. The NK target structures (NK-TS) consisted of three molecular species tentatively assigned molecular weights of 130,000, 160,000, and 240,000 based on electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels. Moloney cell surface antigen (MCSA), gp71, p30, H-2, and NK-TS were localized in distinct fractions of gels. The NK-TS bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose columns and could be eluted with the specific sugar, suggesting that the target structures may be glycosylated. NK-TS molecules could not be detected in gels of NK-insensitive target cells such as P815, A9HT, YWA, or EL-4. The quantity obtained from the gels varied directly with the NK sensitivity of YAC which is more sensitive when grown in vitro than when grown in vivo. The NK-TS molecules specifically inhibited the binding of NK cells but not alloimmune T cells to their appropriate targets. Additional NK-sensitive tumor cells also expressed some or all of the target molecules exhibited by YAC. Some of these structures shared specificities in the case of MPC-11 or were unique in the case of Molt-4 and K562, as shown by cross-inhibition studies.

It was concluded that the gene(s) that tend to duplicate in parallel with the neoplastic transformation of the prothymocyte to an overt leukemic cell have a greater chance of duplicating and/or may have a stronger promoting effect on leukemogenesis if stronger promoting effect on leukemogenesis if located on the CBA-derived, structurally rearranged T(14:15)6 than the corresponding genes located on the C57BL-derived normal chromosome 15.","['Wiener, F', 'Spira, J', 'Ohno, S', 'Haran-Ghera, N', 'Klein, G']","['Wiener F', 'Spira J', 'Ohno S', 'Haran-Ghera N', 'Klein G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Trisomy']",1979/04/15 00:00,1979/04/15 00:01,['1979/04/15 00:00'],"['1979/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910230410 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Apr 15;23(4):504-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910230410.,,,,,,,,,,

Immunization with B10.D2, a strain H-2 identical with BALB/c, does not generate cytostatic effector cells, nor does immunization with the F1 hybrids between B10.D2 and BALB/c. Analysis of the progeny of backcrosses of the F1 hybrids to BALB/c gave evidence that the suppressive effect of B10.D2 immunization is controlled by a single gene. Spleen cells from mice immunized with BALB/c or B10.D2 cultured in vitro with the corresponding stimulator cells yielded soluble factors in the supernatants that were respectively capable of amplifying or suppressing the in vitro cytostatic effect. Such experiments revealed that the inhibition of cytostasis caused by immunization with B10.D2 is not at the sensitization but at the effector phase of the assay.

Its binding to the Fc gamma portion bears many features of the antibody-antigen interaction, such as the dissociation constant, lattice formation, and complement activation. Moreover, SpA seems to compete with membrane Fc receptors for IgG so that the possibility of an interaction with the same CH domain(s) of IgG can be considered. In the present study, evidence is given that anti-SpA antisera obtained from chickens and rabbits are able to inhibit EA rosette formation by normal human lymphocytes and that they are able to recognize, with immunofluorescent staining, a subpopulation of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) that closely resembles that of EA rosette-forming cells (RFC). Moreover, the depletion of EA RFC by means of a single gradient centrifugation is accomplished by the parallel depletion of PBL stainable by anti-SpA antisera. The relevance of these results in the hypothesis of a similarity between the combining sites of SpA and membrane Fc receptor(s) for IgG is discussed.","['Biguzzi, S']",['Biguzzi S'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Cross Reactions', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/*pharmacology', 'Immunodiffusion', '*Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sheep', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/*immunology']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830090112 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1979 Jan;9(1):52-60. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830090112.,,,,,,,,,,

The clinically monitored reduction of leukemic cell mass following therapy was accompanied by reductions in TBK and TBK/Kp.

The collection of epidemiological data, however, is equally important in assessing and providing insight into prophylactic measures. The beneficial effects and risks of vaccination may be calculated by special formulae. Changes in the effect of vaccines can be detected by constant reevaluation of the epidemiological situation by means of these formulae. Another possibility lies in the calculation of the borderline number of complications of a certain disease when the risks of the sequelae of the disease or of the vaccination are about equal. Examples of valuable and recommendable vaccinations are vaccination against measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus and tick-borne encephalitis. A follow-up of the case mortality of whooping-cough in Austria over the past 15 years and a consideration of the fatal complications of vacinnation, as quoted by Ehrengut, reveals that the risks of the disease balanced the risks of vaccination with usual vaccines, already in 1971 (1976 with WHO data). A beneficial effect of BCG vaccination is still present, but the influence on mortality figures is very slight only. However, the benefit of BCG may lie in the prevention of deaths from leukaemia observed by some authors. Paraspecific effects of some vaccinations are mentioned. Finally, cost-benefit calculations for Austria are presented in the case of vaccination against measles and mumps, which appear to be highly recommendable, not only from the medical, but also the economic point of view.","['Wiedermann, G']",['Wiedermann G'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Austria', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Measles/prevention & control', 'Mumps/prevention & control', 'Risk', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/mortality', 'Vaccination/adverse effects/economics/*trends', 'Whooping Cough/mortality']",1979/03/02 00:00,1979/03/02 00:01,['1979/03/02 00:00'],"['1979/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1979/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 1979 Mar 2;91(5):143-50.,,"Moderne Trends im Impfwesen: Erfassung von Nutzen, Risiko und Kosten von Impfungen.",,,,,,,,

Using such modifications, the cytotoxic activity of NRS towards human lymphoid cells was investigated and was found to involve activation of the classical complement pathway rather than activation of the alternate complement pathway.

Because not all patients can undergo invasive procedures, we sought other methods for diagnosis. We reviewed the data from all patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia treated at our center during a 3-year period. Of 125 patients, 18 had invasive aspergillosis (cases). Eleven patients had nose cultures growing Aspergillus flavus or A. fumigatus; 10 of these 11 had aspergillosis, whereas only eight of 114 without such nose cultures had invasive disease (P less than 0.000001). Thus, A. flavus on nose culture appears ""predictive"" for aspergillosis. Absence of such a culture does not preclude infection. Of 125 patients, 61 had sterile nose culture(s) and 14 of the 18 cases had such a sterile nose culture. Only four of the 64 patients without sterile nose cultures developed aspergillosis (P less than 0.008), suggesting a relation between sterile nose culture and aspergillosis. Carbenicillin was used for a longer period among cases and patients with predictive nose cultures than among patients without aspergillosis. These data may help identify patients at risk of aspergillosis and help determine antifungal therapy when invasive procedures are contraindicated.","['Aisner, J', 'Murillo, J', 'Schimpff, S C', 'Steere, A C']","['Aisner J', 'Murillo J', 'Schimpff SC', 'Steere AC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'G42ZU72N5G (Carbenicillin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Agranulocytosis/complications', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Aspergillus flavus/isolation & purification', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/isolation & purification', 'Carbenicillin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Nose/*microbiology']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-90-1-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1979 Jan;90(1):4-9. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-90-1-4.,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients in whom acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) developed following prolonged alkylating agent therapy are described. Five of the patients received no radiotherapy. The conditions treated were: Hodgkin's disease (four patients), primary amyloidosis, primary macroglobulinemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and carcinoma of the tonsil. 2. Prior to the advent of chemotherapy, this complication was not observed in large series of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and multiple myeloma. However, the medical literature now contains at least 125 other detailed reports of ANLL developing after prolonged cytotoxic agent therapy. 3. Multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease, both of which commonly have good responses to chemotherapy, predominate as the underlying diseases. However, 35% of the case reports involve patients with other illnesses, including 12 patients who did not have neoplasms. 4. More than half of the patients developing ANLL have received chemotherapy alone without radiotherapy. 5. At least half of the patients developing ANLL experienced long periods of significant cytopenia during therapy, often with documentation of bone marrow dysplasia. 6. The wide variety of drugs associated with this complication suggests that any cytotoxic agent may be leukemogenic. However, alkylating agents overwhelmingly predominate as the class of compounds which are most often associated with terminal ANLL. 7. The vast majority of patients reported in the literature with ANLL complicating underlying malignancies have received cytotoxic drugs for prolonged periods (median 3 1/2 years) and leukemia developed most commonly 3 to 5 years after the diagnosis of the underlying disease. Most of these patients benefited from therapy and survived longer (median 5 years) than historical control of untreated patients. 8. The leukemogenic potential in man of prolonged cytotoxic agents therapy, especially with alkylating agents, seems to be well established. This evidence admonishes against the prolonged use of these drugs in non-fatal disorders. 9. More accurate assessment of risk: benefit ratios awaits the results of prospective controlled studies. The results of these studies could also lead to significant modifications in recommendations for long-term maintenance therapy with cytotoxic agents.","['Casciato, D A', 'Scott, J L']","['Casciato DA', 'Scott JL']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Alkylating Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Amyloidosis/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Pancytopenia/complications', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Tonsillar Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005792-197901000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1979 Jan;58(1):32-47. doi: 10.1097/00005792-197901000-00002.,156,,,,,,,,,

Mortality rates of 49% for general medical, 54% for lymphoma or leukemia, and 20% for surgery patients suggest the need for a selective admission and discharge policy which concentrates financial and personnel resources on those for whom there remains a reasonable chance of worthwhile palliation, if not cure, of their malignancy. An informal policy of this kind may have contributed to a 10% increase in hospital discharges and a reduction of in-unit mortality from 22--18% when compared to 1035 earlier unselected admissions. A modified version of the classification suggested by the Critical Care Committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital has been adopted for use at this institution. A similar approach by other cancer centers is urged so that predictive indices based on prognosis of the underlying disease as well as physiological status may be developed.

The clinical symptoms did not differ from those in purulent meningitis caused by other bacteria. In the cerebrospinal fluid the cellular response was dominated by polymorphonuclear cells in 29 patients and by mononuclear cells in 20. Ten patients had septicemia, which was fatal in four. Clinical symptoms were dominated by chills, high fever and general prostration. One patient had pleurisy and one an abscess of the neck; both recovered. Serotypes 1 and 4b prevailed and were equally common. Many patients developed raised antibody titers in both the O-agglutination test and the complement fixation test. The titers were often not positive until after a month. Moderate granulocytosis was the rule and monocytosis was rarely seen. Ampicillin alone or combined with an aminoglycoside seemed to be the drug of choice in the treatment of listeriosis. An alternative drug was tetracycline. Most deaths occurred within six days of onset of the illness. Early diagnosis and treatment were imperative.

Knowing those factors and conditions, we have been able to establish a systematic immunopharmacologic study of systemic immunity adjuvants, which has resulted in the discovery of agents whose actions are more rapid than that of BCG on one or a few populations of cells involved in immunity and which, unlike BCG, do not induce suppressor cell amplification. This amplification may explain the difference in the results obtained with this mycobacterium in various clinical immunotherapy trials in which it was applied differently. It is proposed to combine these mono- or pauc-functional adjuvants in order to try to obtain all of the beneficial effects of BCG without the amplification of suppressor cells.","['Mathe, G', 'Florentin, I', 'Olsson, L', 'Bruley-Rosset, M', 'Schulz, J', 'Kiger, N', 'Orbach-Arbouys, S', 'Schwarzenberg, L', 'Pouillart, P', 'de Vassal, F']","['Mathe G', 'Florentin I', 'Olsson L', 'Bruley-Rosset M', 'Schulz J', 'Kiger N', 'Orbach-Arbouys S', 'Schwarzenberg L', 'Pouillart P', 'de Vassal F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '2880D3468G (Levamisole)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'BCG Vaccine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Immunity/drug effects', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/*therapy', 'Levamisole/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Propionibacterium acnes/immunology', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/immunology', 'Thymosin/pharmacology']",1978/11/01 00:00,1978/11/01 00:01,['1978/11/01 00:00'],"['1978/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1978 Nov;62(11):1613-21.,93,,,,,,,,,

ADA deficit associated with combined immunodeficiency is an autosomal recessive form. Low enzyme levels, which is produced by a structural gene located on chromosome 20, were detected in chronic lymphatic leukemias where ADA decrease is correlated to low levels of T lymphocytes and the prevalence of an atypical B lymphocyte population. Particularly high levels of ADA were detected in acute lymphoblastic leukemias, in transplant rejection, in blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia... NP deficit is associated with a T branch immunodeficiency, with high levels of inosine, guanosine, hypouricemia, hypochromic microcythemia and hematopoietic tissue megaloblastosis. This enzyme, with trimeric structure, whose structural gene is located on chromosome 14, shows a cytoplasmic location, and its maximum activity is to be found in T lymphocytes separated by rosetting. IGPT deficit is to be held responsible for the neurological Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This deficit is associated with a depression of B lymphocyte function evaluated as response to the mitogens (PWM, Protein A) or as specific immunoglobulins production. At last the Authors report some personal investigations performed on hemolysates and lymphocytes of subjects with impaired immunity, as well as on some children at birth to establish the correlation between ADA and NP behaviour and immunosurveillance. Lastly, the data on the variations of the enzymatic and immunological parameters of subjects with immunodeficiency associated to enzymopenia after red cell transfusion are reported.","['Mainardi, V', 'Brugo, M A', 'Tassi, G C']","['Mainardi V', 'Brugo MA', 'Tassi GC']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Boll Ist Sieroter Milan,Bollettino dell'Istituto sieroterapico milanese,17720040R,"['EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/deficiency', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*enzymology', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*immunology', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/deficiency', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1978/05/31 00:00,1978/05/31 00:01,['1978/05/31 00:00'],"['1978/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/31 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Boll Ist Sieroter Milan. 1978 May 31;57(2):178-91.,,Immunodeficienze e deficit enzimatici.,,,,,,,,

These cytotoxic agents are commonly employed in the therapy of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia for remission induction therapy, and these antimicrobial agents are used in infection therapy. The maximum concentrations of the two cytotoxic drugs were chosen to be twice the known peak plasma levels of commonly employed dosage schedules. Neither of the cancer chemotherapeutic agents, alone or in combination, demonstrated bactericidal activity at the levels tested. However, in the presence of these agents, the antimicrobial activity of gentamicin and amikacin, although not that of ticarcillin, was depressed for 11 of 15 K. pneumoniae strains and 8 of 15 P. aeruginosa strains, but for none of the strains of E. coli. This level of decreased activity occasionally resulted in a minimal inhibitory concentration of the tested aminoglycoside well above the standard serum levels.

In this case the range of bound 3H-HTX varied from 0.00 to 927 pg/mg protein. The presence of a binder in the cytoplasm of leukocytes might represent a new step in the regulation of endogenous folate metabolism. The MTX, widely used as an antifolate drug, may also be bound by FABP of CGL leukocytes, although in different amounts from case to case: this finding suggests a new point of interference of MTX in the folate metabolism.

This ""preclinical stage"" or preleukemic stage is difficult to recognize by conventional hematologic morphologic techniques. A prospective study was carried out to determine whether cytogenetic studies would be helpful in the recognition of preleukemic states and whether the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities would have prognostic significance. A study of 284 patients with suspected preleukemia has yielded 62 patients with progression to overt ANLL. Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in 30% of suspected preleukemic patients, whereas 53% of the patients progressing to acute leukemia had cytogenetic abnormalities. These studies show that the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities aid in the recognition of preleukemia but are not specific for early leukemia. Patients with cytogenetic abnormalities are more likely to develop overt ANLL. Banded chromosome studies demonstrated cytogenetic abnormalities in the preleukemic phase in 13 of 26 patients.

These are not consistent, but non-random abnormalities are being increasingly identified by banding techniques, pointing to the sites on human chromosomes where genes important in neoplastic development are located. It is postulated that tumor progression occurs as a result of genetic lability within the neoplastic clone, leading to emergence of increasingly mutant subpopulations (often recognizable cytogenetically) with more malignant properties. In the context of this hypothesis, acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, and preleukemia can be viewed as differing only in the rate at which an abnormal hemic clone is expanding, with progression to a more aggressive phase (e.g. the ""blast crisis"" of chronic granulocytic leukemia) reflecting emergence of a new predominant subpopulation as the result of an additional genetic change. These concepts, and the cytogenetic data from which they have been derived, may help our understanding of basic tumor biology, and have some practical applications in the diagnosis of human neoplasms.","['Nowell, P C']",['Nowell PC'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

From October 1972 to December 1975, 473 previously untreated patients entered this study and 465 (390 children and 75 adults) are evaluated in this paper. Of them, 373 (80%) achieved complete remission (children 84% and adults 61%). Out of 109 ""high risk"" children (one or more of the following characteristics at diagnosis: marked organomegaly, mediastinal widening, leukocytosis above 50000/mm3 and CNS involvement) 83 (76%) and out of 281 ""standard risk"" children (all the others) 244 (87%) achieved complete remission. The median duration of complete remission according to different prognostic factors was as follows: ""high risk"" children 10 months, adults 24 months and ""standard risk"" children 25 months. Duration of complete remission of the ""standard risk"" children in relation to with or without intensification, daily or weekly maintenance and additional intrathecal therapy or none, showed no significant difference; however, those who received intensification, daily maintenance and further intrathecal therapy behaved slightly better. Median survival for all the cases of this study was as follows: adults 10 months, ""high risk"" children 12 months and ""standard risk"" children 26 months.

The malignant B cells maintain a limited potential for differentiation. In addition to surface immunoglobulins, various markers may be present on the B cell surface; when surface Ig cannot be identified, these markers are used to identify B cells. However, for practical purposes, the detection of surface Ig is most important in the identification of B cells in immunoproliferative diseases, particularly when the malignant cell population displays only one immunoglobulin light chain. The procedures used so far to detect surface Ig have several drawbacks regarding their sensitivity or their specificity. The advantages of new procedures which involve the identification of B cells by their natural binding of B. melitensis or the detection of surface Ig by antibody-coated E. coli are presented. Detection of changes in the percentage of B lymphocytes and in the ratio of kappa- to gamma-bearing B cells in blood smears or in lymphocyte suspensions may be helpful in the early diagnosis of immunoproliferative diseases.","['Teodorescu, M', 'Mayer, E P']","['Teodorescu M', 'Mayer EP']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/analysis/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Brucella/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Escherichia coli/immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rosette Formation', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*immunology']",1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1978 Sep-Oct;8(5):353-65.,39,,,,,,,,,

Both these effects of F-MuLV were under host genetic control. In vitro suppression of lymphocyte mitogenesis was regulated by a single autosomal gene called Fv-3 that is dominant for susceptibility. Genetic analyses, with the use of the susceptible DBA/2 and resistant B10.D2/n parents, their F1, intercross, and backcross progeny, indicated that a single autosomal gene dominant for susceptibility regulated the in vivo susceptibility to immunosuppression by F-MuLV. Individual [(DBA/2xB10.D2)F1xB10.D2] mice were typed both for susceptibility to F-MuLV-induced suppression of lymphocyte mitogenesis in vitro (an Fv-3 function) and susceptibility to immunosuppression by F-MuLV in vivo. Such an analysis indicated that the same mice that were susceptible or resistant to immunosuppression in vivo were susceptible or resistant to suppression of lymphocyte mitogenesis in vitro.

The percentage of PNP-positive cells largely corresponds to the number of E rosette-forming cells and is inversely proportional to the number of Ig-bearing cells. In six of seven CLL patients studied only a minor percentage of the lymphocytes showed strong PNP activity, whereas the large majority (88%--98%) possessed trace activity. Such patients have a high number of Ig-bearing cells and a low number of E rosette-forming cells. A different pattern of markers was found in the lymphocytes of the seventh CLL patient: 66% were strongly reactive for PNP, an important number formed E rosettes, and a minor percentage were Ig bearing.

This is already made clear by this preliminary study, particularly in the area of acute leukemia and Hodgkin's disease.","['Gastaut, J L', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Carcassonne, Y']","['Gastaut JL', 'Gastaut JA', 'Carcassonne Y']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Neurol (Paris),Revue neurologique,2984779R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/complications']",1978/02/01 00:00,1978/02/01 00:01,['1978/02/01 00:00'],"['1978/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Neurol (Paris). 1978 Feb;134(2):115-31.,,Les complications endocraniennes des hemopathies.

That additional types of the biological effects should have come under scrutiny was directly attributable to widespread use and abuse of this drug on a world-wide basis. Although ""genetic toxicology"" encompasses a broad spectrum of disciplines, including many areas of highly specialized research, perhaps the most germane, and those on which this review has concentrated, are Clastogenicity, Mutagenicity, Teratogenicity and Oncogenicity. Based on our current understanding and interpretation of the available data, the genetic toxicology of LSD provides an excellent example of Newton's ""third law of motion"", e.g., to every force there is an equal and opposite reaction force. From the published material it is impossible to draw clear cut conclusions regarding any of the above ""problem areas"" in spite of the considerable scientific effort invested. Most of the in vitro studies performed on the clastogenicity of LSD indicate either suppression of mitosis or enhanced chromosome damage. However, extrapolation of such results to the in vivo situation is very difficult. With regard to in vivo human use of the drug, no concensus is attainable as to chromosome breakage and the inconsistencies within and between studies remain inexplicable. However, several of the ""controlled"" investigations assessing the in vivo effect of chemically pure LSD suggest a transient increase in lymphocyte chromosome breakage. On the other hand, the results of cytogenetic studies on experimental animals are contradictory. Although human studies are nonexistent, in those experimental organisms tested, using accepted techniques, LSD proved to be, at best, a weak mutagen, if mutagenic at all. Teratogenicity studies in animals are confusing due to the multitude of organisms and plethora of discriminant parameters studied. However, with regard to man there has been ample opportunity and one can conclude that LSD is not teratogenic. As to the drug's oncogenic potential, the 3 reported cases of leukemia in LSD users are most likely the result of coincidence.","['Cohen, M M', 'Shiloh, Y']","['Cohen MM', 'Shiloh Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Teratogens)', '8NA5SWF92O (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drosophila', 'Female', 'Fetus/drug effects', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Lysergic Acid Diethylamide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Macropodidae', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mice', '*Mutagens', 'Plants', 'Pregnancy', 'Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Sea Urchins', 'Teratogens']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1110(77)90003-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(77)90003-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1977-1978;47(3-4):183-209. doi: 10.1016/0165-1110(77)90003-3.,160,,,,,,,,,

Reactivity with products of lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells.,1199-205,"It was shown previously, that an antiserum directed against highly purified fractions of migration inhibitory factor inhibits delayed hypersensitivity reactions in vivo and in vitro. Using radiolabeling techniques we determined that the anti-lymphokine serum reacted primarily with three lymphocyte activation products (m.w. 60,000, 45,000, and 30,000) all of which had a similar isoelectric point of 5.2. The cellular origin of this material was investigated. It was found that activated B cells, B leukemia cells (L2C), and growing fibroblasts produced material of a similar m.w. as analyzed on SDS-PAGE. No cross-reaction was found with radiolabeled products of activated murine and human lymph node cells and of SV 40-infected African green monkey kidney cells. The isoelectric point of the reactive material from B cells, leukemia cells, and fibroblasts was determined at 5.2. In addition to material with pI 5.2, lymph node cells also produced material with pI 3.5 to 4.5, which focused at pH 5.0 to 5.4. After neuraminidase treatment macrophage migration inhibitory activity in fibroblast culture supernatants could be absorbed specifically to insolubilized anti-lymphokine antibody. These findings suggests that lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells are capable of producing molecules whose physicochemical and functional properties appear to be identical.","['Sorg, C', 'Geczy, C L']","['Sorg C', 'Geczy CL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Fibroblasts/immunology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/*immunology', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice']",1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1978 Sep;121(3):1199-205.,,,,,,,,,,

As recorded by time-lapse cinematography, the two cell configurations represent different functional states: resting cells are completely spherical, locomotive cells are polarized with a conspicuous extension posteriorly. In 9 out of 12 cases of acute myeloid leukemia the two cell configurations were found to coincide with a different pattern of intermediate-sized filaments (ISF). Most spherical myeloblasts possessed large bundles of ISF (a minority had small bundles), whereas polarized myeloblasts showed small groups or single filaments. A similar correlation between cell shape and arrangement of ISF was observed in a transplantable undifferentiated rat leukemia. Two concepts can be distinguished with regard to the role of fibrillar structures in leukemic myeloblasts: thick bundles of ISF either represent a pathological state or have a functional significance. A tentative interpretation of our own results provides some arguments in favor of a disaggregation-reaggregation cycle of thick ISF bundles, whereas a pathological (""end stage"") nature of these structures appears less likely.","['Felix, H', 'Strauli, P']","['Felix H', 'Strauli P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

HIX and Moloney viruses share the majority of the large T1 oligonucleotides derived from their genomes but each possesses a set of distinctive oligonucleotides that lie clustered in corresponding regions in the 3' halves of their oligonucleotide maps. These regions presumably contain envelope glycoprotein coding sequences. The type C viral envelope glycoprotein is believed to be translated from a 21S RNA. Thus, at least part of the region of the Moloney virus genome that is altered relative to HIX was expected to be present on such a species. To test this prediction, we purified an intracellular 21S Moloney viral RNA species and analyzed its large T1 oligonucleotides by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This RNA contains one T1 oligonucleotide that is probably derived from the 5' end of the Moloney virus genome, the Moloney virus T1 oligonucleotides that are missing in HIX, and those that lie to their 3' side on the Moloney virus T1 oligonucleotide map.","['Faller, D V', 'Rommelaere, J', 'Hopkins, N']","['Faller DV', 'Rommelaere J', 'Hopkins N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.27.3 (Ribonuclease T1)']",IM,"['*Genes, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Oligoribonucleotides/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Ribonuclease T1/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1978/06/01 00:00,1978/06/01 00:01,['1978/06/01 00:00'],"['1978/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.75.6.2964 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1978 Jun;75(6):2964-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.75.6.2964.,,,PMC392687,,,,,,,

Several lines of evidence indicate that this effect is due to interferon itself, rather than to unknown contaminants of interferon preparations. Autoradiograph analysis of growth parameters of Friend leukemia cells during treatment with interferon demonstrates that the rate of entry into the S phase, the percent decline of unlabeled mitoses, and the mitotic indexes are significantly lower in interferon-treated cell cultures than in control untreated cultures when tritiated thymidine was added 12 h after the administration of interferon. These data indicate that fractions of interferon-treated cell population are delayed in both G1 and in G2 phases of the cell cycle. This was confirmed by exact measurements of the length of the various phases of the cycle. The interferon-induced inhibition of growth of Friend leukemia cells is reversible after removal of the compound. Autoradiograph data obtained from control cultures and from cultures previously treated with interferon that had been washed free of interferon and reseeded in interferon-free medium, demonstrate that during the first 12 h after removal of interferon, a large majority of the cells previously treated with interferon had a deranged flow into the S phase, a high number of unlabeled mitoses, and a low mitotic index. These data provide further evidence for the above-mentioned prolongations of G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. All growth parameters tested reverted to normal values within 12 h after washing out interferon.","['Matarese, G P', 'Rossi, G B']","['Matarese GP', 'Rossi GB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice']",1977/11/01 00:00,1977/11/01 00:01,['1977/11/01 00:00'],"['1977/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.75.2.344 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1977 Nov;75(2 Pt 1):344-54. doi: 10.1083/jcb.75.2.344.,,,PMC2109928,,,,,,,

By this assay, we can better correlate specific structures of these drugs with inhibitory mechanisms. Using an immobilized template, we were also able to observe drug effects on the stability of complexes formed between the polymerase, a template (polyadenylic acid-agarose), and a primer, as well as to monitor the synthesis of DNA in the presence of drug. For each drug, we determined the complex (intermediate in DNA synthesis) which was primarily affected and whether the effect was due to a destabilization process. Although the activity and specificity of the unsubstituted ansamycins (streptovaricins and rifamycin SV) were modulated by conformation of the molecule and electron density of the aromatic ring, the principal mode of inhibition is, apparently, drug binding to a polymerase-template complex; the drug binds in a manner which prevents subsequent formation of a polymerase-template-primer complex. However, some derivatives of rifamycin SV, when substituted at carbon-3 with bulky or hydrophobic side chains, displayed markedly different modes of action. For example, demethyl dimethyl rifampin prevented the formation of polymerase-template complexes, whereas rifazacyclo 16 acted by promoting the dissociation of polymerase-template-primer complexes.","['Milavetz, B I', 'Horoszewicz, J S', 'Rinehart, K L Jr', 'Carter, W A']","['Milavetz BI', 'Horoszewicz JS', 'Rinehart KL Jr', 'Carter WA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Rifamycins)', '1404-74-6 (Streptovaricin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Enzymes, Immobilized', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'RNA/*physiology', 'Rifamycins/pharmacology', 'Sepharose', 'Streptovaricin/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Templates, Genetic']",1978/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.13.3.435 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1978 Mar;13(3):435-40. doi: 10.1128/AAC.13.3.435.,,,PMC352260,,,,,,,"['CA 14801-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-33736/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']"

Pathological persistence or fragmentation of the nucleoli is thought to be the cause of some numerical chromosomal aberrations due to non-disjunction of the chromatids, with particular involvement of the satellite chromosomes. Thus, a combined selective staining of both the nucleoli (amido black 10B according to Mundkur and Brauer's cytochemical technique) and the chromosomes (neutral red) was applied to the metaphase plates of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in the blastic crisis. Duplicated Ph1 was associated with amido black-stained areas at a very high rate in some cases. Since the blastic crisis in chronic myeloid leukaemia is characterized by the appearance of an increased number of immature, highly nucleolated cells, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that the duplication of the Ph1 represents a feature possibly favoured by the pathological persistence of nucleolar RNA-rich structures in the metaphase.","['Castoldi, G', 'Borsetti, G', 'Abbasciano, V', 'Scapoli, G']","['Castoldi G', 'Borsetti G', 'Abbasciano V', 'Scapoli G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Ric Clin Lab,La Ricerca in clinica e in laboratorio,7613947,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Nucleolus/*analysis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA/*analysis']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02932178 [doi]'],ppublish,Ric Clin Lab. 1979 Jul-Sep;9(3):265-71. doi: 10.1007/BF02932178.,,,,,,,,,,

Work over the past years and especially results of the past few years indicate that type-C viral or viral related genetic information exists in humans. 2. We do not know how this information entered humans or whether it causes disease, but it is of interest that the probes from the viruses used to detect this information are from the very same viruses which we find can affect growth and differentiation of some human hematopoietic cells. 3. The status of actual virus isolates from humans, though encouraging because of similarities of isolates from five different laboratories, remain very perplexing and so far have not been especially informative to human leukemogenesis. 4. In the near future we hope to clone in bacteria the viral related sequences detected in human DNA in order to more precisely determine their chemical and biological properties. The HL-60 system may also afford an opportunity to purify receptors for CSF. When CSF and other, perhaps more important, regulatory factors are purified, we would like to determine if they bind differently to leukemic and normal cells.","['Gallo, R C']",['Gallo RC'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Primates/microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification', '*Retroviridae/analysis/immunology']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-67057-2_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1979;23:7-24. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-67057-2_2.,,,,,,,,,,

The dose-response curves for AMV and RMuLV polymerases primed with (rA)n.(dT)10 showed PFA to be a 1000-fold more active than PAA; the RMuLV polymerase activity was reduced to 50% after incubation with 0.7 microM-PFA and 0.7 mM-PAA, respectively. There was no difference in PFA inhibition of virus-associated and purified reverse transcriptase activity. Results with various synthetic templates showed that both the RNA- and the DNA-dependent polymerase activities of reverse transcriptase were inhibited by PFA. The endogenous polymerase activity of AMV was inhibited to 50% at 100 microM-PFA, while PAA had no effect. The PFA inhibition was dependent on whether Mg2+ or Mn2+ was used as divalent cation in the assay. Phosphonoformate arrested DNA synthesis immediately after being added to the assay system.

The plasma membrane of extragonadal somatic cells absorbed 1.2 to 2.8% of these hydrophobic proteins. The unoccupied H-Y receptor sites residing on the plasma membrane of bovine fetal ovarian cells, on the other hand, selectively absorbed polymers of 18,000 mol. wt. subunits, and this antigen-receptor interaction, if allowed to continue for five days, induced the formation of tunica albuginea and seminiferous tubules in bovine XX embryonic indifferent gonads.

Young adult cats at an age previously demonstrated to be highly resistant to FeLV, were injected intravenously with moderately toxic doses (15-20 mg/kg) of MNU alone or with infections FeLV (Rickard strain). Following exposure to virus and chemical, cats were monitored for antibody to the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA), viremia by direct infectivity and the presence of gsa in peripheral blood leukocytes, and for toxic effects of MNU by hemogram analyses on peripheral blood. Of 8 cats injected with MNU + FeLV, 6 developed persistent viremia, 5 of which became debilitated from thymic lymphoma. Only 1 of 6 non-MNU-treated and infected cats of the same age became transiently viremic. FOCMA antibody development was markedly depressed in MNU + FeLV inoculated cats compared with cats inoculated with FeLV alone. Results show that MNU was apparently responsible for the obliteration of age-related susceptibility in cats to FeLV infection and induction of FeLV-related disease, and suggest that in nature exposure to toxic chemical carcinogens may act as factors which determine susceptibility to feline oncornaviruses in the cat.","['Schaller, J P', 'Mathes, L E', 'Hoover, E A', 'Olsen, R G']","['Schaller JP', 'Mathes LE', 'Hoover EA', 'Olsen RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Cats', 'Epitopes', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Methylnitrosourea/*pharmacology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*pharmacology']",1979/11/15 00:00,1979/11/15 00:01,['1979/11/15 00:00'],"['1979/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910240526 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Nov 15;24(5):700-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910240526.,,,,,,,,,,

Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice have little or no natural killer (NK) cell activity, but when they are relocated in conventional conditions, they develop strong NCMC within 2 to 3 days. Unlike other SPF animals, hypothymic nude mice display good NCMC which is further augmented upon their entry into a pathogenic environment. The ontogeny, genetic control and other features of pathogen-activated NCMC resemble those previously described for NK cells. An H2-D region NCMC regulatory gene is active in either a homozygous or heterozygous state, but to be operative seems to require the presence of an additional complementing locus, which maps outside the H-2 complex. It is proposed that H-2 influences NCMC levels by affecting the expression or immunogenicity of NK cell-activating determinants. Recently activated NK cells were non-adherent and lacked Ia and Thy-1 determinants. NCMC was not affected by treatment with monoclonal high-titer Thy-1.2 antisera and complement. However, an Ly-6.2 antiserum did contain anti-NK cytotoxic activity, which was shown by absorption analysis to be distinct from anti-Ly-6.2 activity. The NK antigen has a strain distribution pattern distinct from Ly-5 and other Ly markers, but may be related or identical to NK-1.","['Clark, E A', 'Russell, P H', 'Egghart, M', 'Horton, M A']","['Clark EA', 'Russell PH', 'Egghart M', 'Horton MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human', 'Paramyxoviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology']",1979/11/15 00:00,1979/11/15 00:01,['1979/11/15 00:00'],"['1979/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910240525 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Nov 15;24(5):688-99. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910240525.,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-B6 R101 (anti-Kb) CTL, which display a cross-lysis of mutant Kbd (M505) and Kba (Hzl) target cells, were separated into two fractions, one of them being able and the other unable to adhere to the cell monolayer of the particular mutant. The fraction of anti-Kb CTL adherent to Kba antigen was isolated by elution from the Hzl cell monolayer. These anti-Kba CTL and CTL eluted from the B6 cell monolayer displayed a considerably higher cytotoxic effect on B6 than on Hzl target cells. This difference was not due to lower sensitivity of Hzl targets to lysis. The findings indicate that anti-Kb CTL are homogeneous in the specificity of their receptors.

Nystatin is a channel former and mellitin is not, although both are hemolytic. Whereas MAC and melittin disintegrated the viral membrane, nystatin had no effect on morphology, integrity, and infectivity of the virus. Incorporation of the antibiotic into the viral membranes was demonstrated by measurements of the characteristic fluorescence of nystatin in membranes and the dose-dependent increase in viral density after uptake of the antibiotic. The density of nystatin was measured to be 1.26-1.27 g/cm3. Proof for the formation of functional nystatin channels was obtained by light scattering measurements. Exposure of untreated virus to hypotonic conditions increased viral light scattering because of osmotic swelling but otherwise had no effect on the integrity of the virus. Nystatin channel formation abolished the light scattering change, showing that the antibiotic had impaired the viral permeability barrier. We interpret these results to indicate that virolysis by MAC is not caused by channel formation and, conversely, in the absence of colloid-osmotic effects, channel formation by itself is not sufficient to disassemble a viral membrane.","['Esser, A F', 'Bartholomew, R M', 'Jensen, F C', 'Muller-Eberhard, H J']","['Esser AF', 'Bartholomew RM', 'Jensen FC', 'Muller-Eberhard HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bee Venoms)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '1400-61-9 (Nystatin)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bee Venoms/*pharmacology', 'Complement System Proteins/*metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Ion Channels/*drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Melitten/*pharmacology', 'Membranes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Nystatin/*pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Water-Electrolyte Balance/drug effects']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.11.5843 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Nov;76(11):5843-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.11.5843.,,,PMC411748,,,,,,,

However, oligonucleotide fingerprints obtained of MMTV 70S RNA revealed that approximately 20% of the large oligonucleotides examined were unique to each virus. The oligonucleotide fingerprint indicated that although the viruses were similar, they differed in their genetic content. The differences in the two viruses extended to immunological differences in the major envelope glycoprotein, gp52. C3Hf MMTV competed only partially in a homologous radioimmunoassay for gp52 of C3H MMTV, whereas C3H MMTV gave complete competition, indicating that gp52 of C3H MMTV contained type-specific determinants not present on gp52 of C3Hf MMTV. Comparison of C3Hf MMTV with highly oncogenic C3H, GR, and RIII MMTVs in a homologous C3H MMTV gp52 assay gave two patterns of reactivity: complete competition by GR and C3H MMTV and incomplete competition by C3Hf and RIII MMTV. Absorption of anti-C3H MMTV serum by either C3Hf MMTV or RIII MMTV removed all antibodies against both viruses but not against GR and C3H MMTVs.

Using labeled A-MuLV-induced nonproducer cells, only P120 could be detected by anti-AbT sera, suggesting that it may be the only A-MuLV-specified protein. Reactivity of anti-AbT sera with P120 was not blocked by M-MuLV virion proteins, implying that the sera recognize a portion of P120 that is not homologous to any M-MuLV product. Anti-AbT sera stained the surface of live, A-MuLV-transformed nonproducer cells in a two-stage immunofluorescence assay, and such staining was not blocked by M-MuLV protein. Also, intact A-MuLV-transformed cells absorbed much of the reactivity of certain anti-AbT sera for P120. Thus a portion of P120 appears to be exposed on the surface of transformed cells. P120 lacks detectable carbohydrate, is not affected by endoglycosidase H, and cannot be labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination.

Purification of this activity indicated that it was associated with a smaller molecule than that produced by wild-type virus.

A novel dehydrogenation of the latter through the application of a trimethylsilylation-oxidation procedure gave ara-AC in good yield. Using murine L1210 leukemia as a test system, ara-AC was evaluated for antitumor properties in parallel determinations with 5-AC and ara-C. Although higher dose levels were necessary, ara-AC demonstrated a reproducibly greater efficacy in the L1210 system (% ILS = 144-148) than that shown by 5-AC (% ILS = 126-124) or ara-C (% ILS=127-121 ). Moreover, initial data suggest that ara-AC exhibits less host toxicity than either 5-AC or ARA-C.

The DHL-1 enzyme used template-primers at levels expected of a viral reverse transcriptase, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoretic analysis of radioiodinated DHL-1 enzyme revealed a peak at a position corresponding to those of several other type C viral reverse transcriptases (namely, at 72,000-78,000 daltons). The purified enzyme was partially neutralized by antibodies specific for the reverse transcriptase of simian sarcoma virus. Two-dimensional analysis on thin-layer cellulose plates of tryptic hydrolysates of the radioiodinated enzymes of several viruses revealed that six peptides are common to the polymerases of simian sarcoma virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, baboon endogenous virus, and the DHL-1 virus, and that two to four peptides are unique to each of these enzymes. The DHL-1 viral reverse transcriptase appears to be most closely related structurally to the enzymes of simian sarcoma virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, and baboon endogenous virus. However, the DHL-1 viral enzyme differed from any one or combination of the other subhuman primate viral enzymes by virtue of its unique peptides. The implications of these findings with respect to the probable origin of the DHL-1 virus are discussed.","['Goodenow, R S', 'Kaplan, H S']","['Goodenow RS', 'Kaplan HS']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Species Specificity', 'Trypsin']",1979/10/01 00:00,1979/10/01 00:01,['1979/10/01 00:00'],"['1979/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.10.4971 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Oct;76(10):4971-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.10.4971.,,,PMC413060,,,,,,,

The assay will detect the number of double strand breaks induced by as little as 1000 rad of X-ray. The rate of DNA elution through the filters under neutral conditions increases with X-ray dose. Certain conditions for deproteinization, pH, and filter type are shown to increase the assay's sensitivity. Hydrogen peroxide and Bleomycin also induce apparent DNA double strand breaks, although the ratios of double to single strand breaks vary from those produced by X-ray. The introduction of double strand cuts by HpA I restriction endonuclease in DNA lysed on filters results in a rapid rate of elution under neutral conditions, implying that the method can detect double strand breaks if they exist in the DNA. The eluted DNA bands with a double stranded DNA marker in cesium chloride. This evidence suggests that the assay detects DNA double strand breaks. L1210 cells are shown to rejoin most of the DNA double strand breaks induced by 5-10 krad of X-ray with a half-time of about 40 minutes.","['Bradley, M O', 'Kohn, K W']","['Bradley MO', 'Kohn KW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/pharmacology', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1979/10/10 00:00,1979/10/10 00:01,['1979/10/10 00:00'],"['1979/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/7.3.793 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1979 Oct 10;7(3):793-804. doi: 10.1093/nar/7.3.793.,,,PMC328056,,,,,,,

Among the values of experience those factors will play a part, the evidence of which during the ALL initial stage will be a risk for successful therapy and survival rate. This results in a choice of more aggressive variants of modern therapy schemes. In a cytogenetic study made in 35 children with ALL it was tested, whether even leukaemic chromosome clones will be a risk for the course of acute leukaemia. The duration of the first remission and survival rate were considered as criteria. The evidence of a leukaemic chromosome clone could be shown to be followed by a short survival rate, irrespective of the stage of the disease where the clone had been observed first. Thus, cytostatic therapy in those ALL patients who are affected with luekaemic chromosome aberration of stem line character should be aimed at the complete annihilation of the clone, irrespective of other remission criteria. The failure of blood and bone-marrow cultures as early as during the untreated initial stage indicated a primary cellular immuno-insufficiency. This combination of cell immuno-depression with high peripheral leukocytes connts and a primary mediastinal tumour or a generalizing lymphosarcoma respectively, was the highest risk up till now for the course of the disease. Judging from the duration of the first remission and the survival rates, the consecutive schemes of therapy did not differ in their effect on leukaemia with pathological stem lines. On the basis of the present study the impression could not be excluded that up till now long term survival rates could be attributed rather to individual manners of response than to the modern therapy scheme.","['Kirchner, M']",['Kirchner M'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch,"Folia haematologica (Leipzig, Germany : 1928)",0374615,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Culture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Metaphase', 'Risk']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch. 1979;106(2):182-96.,,Die leukamischen Chromosomenklone.

Transplants of RL male 1 regressed after initial growth, and after tumor regression mice could resist repeated inocula of 10(7) RL male 1 cells. Spleen cells from immunized mice after in vitro stimulation with RL male 1 were cytotoxic for RL male 1 cells in 3-hr 51Cr assays. Pretreatment of immune spleen cells with Thy-1, Lyt-2, or Lyt-3 antisera and complement eliminated cytotoxic activity, indicating that effector cells for RL male 1 lysis are T cells. Tests with other target cells showed little or no cytotoxicity. Analysis of the specificity of T-cell killing of RL male 1 by competitive inhibition assays with unlabeled cells indicated that only RL male 1 could inhibit killing; other BALB/c tumors (13 x-ray or murine leukemia virus-induced leukemias and three myelomas) failed to inhibit lysis of RL male 1. A range of alloantisera and heteroantisera were tested for their capacity to block lytic activity in the absence of added complement. H-2d antisera and Lyt-2 and -3 antisera blocked lysis, the latter at the level of the effector cell. Antisera to other cell surface alloantigens, murine leukemia virus-related antigens, and immunoglobulins did not block RL male 1 lysis. Thus, T cells from mice immunized against RL male 1 recognize an individually distinct or unique antigen that does not appear to be related to any of the serologically defined cell surface determinants of RL male 1. In its restriction to a single leukemia, the RL male 1 antigen resembles the individually distinct antigens of chemically induced tumors and other tumor types of rodents.","['Nakayama, E', 'Shiku, H', 'Takahashi, T', 'Oettgen, H F', 'Old, L J']","['Nakayama E', 'Shiku H', 'Takahashi T', 'Oettgen HF', 'Old LJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Binding, Competitive', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Isoantibodies/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.7.3486 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Jul;76(7):3486-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.7.3486.,,,PMC383851,,,,,,,
