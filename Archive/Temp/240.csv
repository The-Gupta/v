The purpose of this report is to provide histology-specific incidence rates within single-year age groups, stratified by sex and race, among children. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Institute's SEER Program were used to calculate incidence rates among children younger than 15 years of age at diagnosis. The SEER population denominator file was modified to allow calculation of rates within single years of age. RESULTS: Large differences in rates within 5-year age groups were found for many histologic types. Retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumor, for instance, had up to eight-fold differences. Substantial differences also were observed for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute lymphoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and osteosarcoma. In general, rates were higher among males than females, although female rates were often higher among young children. Rates of white children were generally higher than those of black children, especially during the first 5 years of life.

Alterations to the RAR alpha and the PML gene structures in the t(15;17) have been characterized and used as specific molecular marker for diagnosis of the disease. PML/RAR alpha antagonizes wild-type PML and RXR and could block the differentiation pathways mediated by these two regulators. A variant translocation t(11;17) has also been discovered in a subset of APL which fuses RAR alpha to a new gene, PLZF on chromosome 11q23. Both PML/RAR alpha and PLZF/RAR alpha display the ""dominant negative"" effect on the wild-type RAR/RXR. However, t(11;17) APL patients differ from t(15;17) APL in that they respond poorly to ATRA. Morphologically defined APL cases which however do not have PML/RAR alpha generally show no response to ATRA. Recently it has been shown that PML/RAR alpha can be modulated directly by ATRA. All these data support the idea that PML/RAR alpha is a specific target of ATRA which can overcome the differentiation block imposed by PML/RAR alpha. The ATRA treatment of APL thus further reinforces the concept of differentiation therapy.","['Chen, Z', 'Chen, S J', 'Wang, Z Y']","['Chen Z', 'Chen SJ', 'Wang ZY']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, P.R.

Two new isolates, Bo and Md, were found, which presented a divergence of 0.4-0.7% from the IIa prototype HTLV-II-Mo, thus indicating that they belong to the HTLV-IIa subtype. The results strongly support the existence of two distinct molecular subtypes of HTLV-II infecting Italian IDUs and demonstrate that, although the IIb subtype appears to be prevalent, there is the same variability for this virus in Europe as found in the United States. The Italian IIb isolates were also seen to encode an additional 25 amino acids at the C-terminal end of tax protein, as already shown for other IIb isolates. The identification of two HTLV-II molecular subtypes among Italian drug addicts will be useful in tracing the worldwide distribution of this virus and in further understanding its molecular structure and biology.","['Salemi, M', 'Cattaneo, E', 'Casoli, C', 'Bertazzoni, U']","['Salemi M', 'Cattaneo E', 'Casoli C', 'Bertazzoni U']","['Istituto di Genetica Biochimica ed Evoluzionistica, CNR, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics', 'Genes, env', 'HTLV-II Infections/etiology/*microbiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/genetics', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous/complications/*microbiology', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199504120-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1995 Apr 15;8(5):516-20. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199504120-00013.,,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (human T-cell leukemia virus type-II protein gp21)']",,"['GENBANK/X80241', 'GENBANK/X80242', 'GENBANK/X80243', 'GENBANK/X80244']",['env'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Two HAM patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I) developed clonal lymphoproliferative disease during the study period. Patients with ATLL have a poor prognosis; multiple chemotherapy regimens including high-dose cytotoxic agents have been utilized with a small impact on survival. Most of our patients are currently treated with experimental regimens. Rheumatologic or autoimmune illnesses were identified, mostly in HAM patients, and a small number developed immunodeficiencies in the absence of other definable etiologic factors. Most of the patients were immigrants from areas of endemicity in the Caribbean basin, although many Americans were also recognized. HTLV-I/II infection was diagnosed serologically and typed as HTLV-I by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a modified Western blot when a DNA sample was not available. In 24 of 40 patients with ATLL, Southern blot hybridization performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes or tumor tissue demonstrated clonal HTLV-I integration. In South Florida, ATLL and HAM are now seen frequently.

Immunological classification showed B-lymphocyte origin of blast cells in 15 patients including 11 small non-cleaved Burkitt's lymphoma (mature B and cALL phenotype), 3 undifferentiated cases (pro-B and mature B cell) and 1 case of lymphoblastic lymphoma (cALL type). T-cell origin of blast cells was demonstrated in 13 patients. The immunological classification used routinely was helpful in selection of patients with unfavourable prognosis. The more precise description of blast cells was valuable for better adjustment of therapy and better prognosis.","['Pituch-Noworolska, A', 'Miezynski, W']","['Pituch-Noworolska A', 'Miezynski W']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, Polish-American Childrens Hospital, Krakow.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol J Pathol,Polish journal of pathology : official journal of the Polish Society of Pathologists,9437432,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/*immunology', 'Male']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol J Pathol. 1994;45(4):257-61.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A postmortem study.,1006-10,"To define better the syndrome of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), we conducted a postmortem study in 77 patients who died of pulmonary complications, distributed into three groups. Group A included 47 patients with hematologic diseases treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT); Group B, 20 patients with hematologic diseases treated with conventional chemotherapy; and Group C, 10 patients without hematologic diseases. The diagnosis of DAH was established when there was blood in at least 30% of the lung tissue evaluated without evidence of infection or any other pathologic change that could account for its presence. The presence of an associated pulmonary complication was considered only when there was normal lung parenchyma between both blood and the specific lesions. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was shown in 11 patients in Group A (23%) compared with 1 patient in Group B (5%) (p < 0.05). Of the 11 patients with DAH in Group A, 10 had some associated pulmonary complication: 7 presented with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), 2 with associated bacterial pneumonia and 1 with invasive aspergillosis, 2 others had an associated cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis, and the remaining patients had an associated herpes pneumonia. There were no clinical differences between patients with and without DAH. Of 8 patients with confirmed DAH in Group A, who had been submitted to a bronchoscopic examination within 1 wk of death, 4 had normal BAL fluid; by contrast, 7 of 13 patients without DAH had hemorrhagic BAL fluid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Agusti, C', 'Ramirez, J', 'Picado, C', 'Xaubet, A', 'Carreras, E', 'Ballester, E', 'Torres, A', 'Battochia, C', 'Rodriguez-Roisin, R']","['Agusti C', 'Ramirez J', 'Picado C', 'Xaubet A', 'Carreras E', 'Ballester E', 'Torres A', 'Battochia C', 'Rodriguez-Roisin R']","['Department of Pathologic Anatomy, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,9421642,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cadaver', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', '*Pulmonary Alveoli', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1164/ajrccm/151.4.1006 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1995 Apr;151(4):1006-10. doi: 10.1164/ajrccm/151.4.1006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the diverse targets of these pleiotropic factors are adipocytes, embryonic stem cells, hepatocytes, and cells belonging to the hematopoietic, immune and nervous systems. An explanation for the shared biologic activities of IL-6 subfamily members is provided by the finding that these cytokines trigger overlapping signal transduction pathways in responsive cells through a common receptor subunit, termed gp130. With the exception of CNTF, which appears to function primarily within the nervous system, IL-6-type cytokines differ from classical hormones in that they are synthesized by many tissues, frequently in association with disease states or in response to infection or injury. This article discusses the hematologic effects of dysregulated expression of IL-6 and related cytokines, highlighting results obtained in our laboratory with murine models of cytokine excess created by retroviral gene delivery to the hematopoietic system.","['Hawley, R G']",['Hawley RG'],"['Division of Cancer Research, Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Chimera', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/genetics/*physiology/toxicity', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*physiology/toxicity', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Signal Transduction']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Stem Cells. 1994;12 Suppl 1:155-71.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First identified because of its involvement in a rare chromosome translocation in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, it is now recognized to be involved in up to 25% of T cell leukemias. Normally within the hemopoietic system the gene is expressed in progenitor cells, erythroid cells, mast cells and megakaryocytes. During macrophage differentiation the level of SCL mRNA and protein becomes undetectable. To examine this further, SCL was over expressed in murine M1 cells. This resulted in perturbation of macrophage differentiation induced by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin-M (OSM) but not interleukin (IL)-6. Moreover the perturbation of LIF-induced differentiation applied to some components of macrophage differentiation but not others. This suggests that signaling through the gp130 homodimer (as occurs with IL-6) does not utilize an SCL-inhibitable pathway. In contrast the LIF receptor/gp130 heterodimer does utilize an SCL-inhibitable pathway for some elements of macrophage differentiation (e.g., lysozyme induction) but not others (e.g., M-CSF receptor induction).","['Begley, C G']",['Begley CG'],"['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Stem Cells. 1994;12 Suppl 1:143-9; discussion 149-51.,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",63,,['SCL'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR analysis revealed a complete V delta 2(Dn)J delta 1 gene rearrangement, an incomplete V delta 2D delta 3 rearrangement and a large amplification product, which cannot be explained with normal VDJ recombinatorial processes, in one case each. Furthermore although V delta 2 and J delta were rearranged, no comigration of rearranged fragments was observed and no PCR product was obtained in one case. Obtained results in AML differ from findings in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of B-cell lineage, where a more homogeneous pattern of rearrangements has been described.

Although PCR has several inherent problems, accumulated data have demonstrated that patients with leukemia harbor PCR-detectable residual disease for a certain period despite clinical remission. This has been for approximately 1 year in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and adult acute promyelocytic leukemia after chemotherapy and for approximately 2 years in chronic myelogenous leukemia after bone marrow transplantation. Ultimately, PCR-undectable residual disease is necessary for achieving cures in most patients. However, it is difficult to make an early prediction of subsequent relapse after obtaining PCR negatively, since the emergence of PCR-detectable disease occurs only several months before clinical relapse. Therefore, PCR negativity is necessary but not sufficient for achieving cures in most patients with leukemia. Periods of persistent PCR-detectable disease will require further investigations for relapse prediction. More accurate serial quantitation would clarify a precise MRD status in leukemia patients and might allow for more accurate prediction of relapse. Since PCR-undectable residual disease is necessary for cures in most patients, it can be proposed that a ""molecular remission"", defined as PCR-undetectable disease, is a milestone and target for achieving cure by cytoreductive therapy.","['Ito, Y', 'Miyamura, K']","['Ito Y', 'Miyamura K']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409114140 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Dec;16(1-2):57-64. doi: 10.3109/10428199409114140.,,,76,,"['BCR/ABL', 'IgH', 'TCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expression of integrin adhesion molecules and of membrane oligosaccharide structures is found in AML and various solid tumors. With respect to AML, these alterations in adhesive phenotype may confer a proliferative advantage on the malignant cells in the marrow, may facilitate egress from the bone marrow into the peripheral vasculature and may enable AML blast cells to traverse the vessel wall and so establish extravascular disease.

These processes are dynamically interrelated, in that T cell activation regulates the strength of CD2-mediated T cell adhesion. The lateral redistribution of CD2 and its ligand CD58 (LFA-3) in T cell and target membranes, respectively, has also been shown to affect cellular adhesion strength. We have used the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique to measure the lateral mobility of CD2 in plasma membranes of resting and activated Jurkat T leukemia cells. CD2-mediated T cell activation caused lateral immobilization of 90% of cell surface CD2 molecules. Depleting cells of cytoplasmic Ca2+, loading cells with dibutyric cAMP, and disrupting cellular microfilaments each partially reversed the effect of CD2-mediated activation on the lateral mobility of CD2. These intracellular mediators apparently influence the same signal transduction pathways, because the effects of the mediators on CD2 lateral mobility were not additive. In separate experiments, activation-associated cytoplasmic Ca2+ mobilization was found to require microfilament integrity and to be negatively regulated by cAMP. By directly or indirectly controlling CD2 lateral diffusion and cell surface distribution, cytoplasmic Ca2+ mobilization may have an important regulatory role in CD2 mediated T cell adhesion.","['Liu, S J', 'Hahn, W C', 'Bierer, B E', 'Golan, D E']","['Liu SJ', 'Hahn WC', 'Bierer BE', 'Golan DE']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/physiology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'CD2 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(95)80207-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80207-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1995 Feb;68(2):459-70. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80207-9.,"['AI-28554/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-15157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-32854/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,PMC1281710,,,,,,,,,,

Improvements in diagnosis are the result of greater attention to cell morphology and the routine use of monoclonal antibodies, which in turn help define composite phenotypes that are specific for CLL and HCL. The combination of morphology and immunophenotype allowed the characterization of a new disorder, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, which was confused in the past with both CLL and HCL. The most important treatment developments stem from the availability of three nucleoside analogues: fludarabine, deoxycoformycin, and chlorodeoxyadenosine which, when used as single agents, are responsible for major improvements in remission rates in CLL (fludarabine, chlorodeoxyadenosine), HCL (deoxycoformycin, chlorodeoxyadenosine) and prolonged periods of disease-free survival. Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma remains a unique leukemia model, and interest in the worldwide distribution of the causative retrovirus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus I, continues with emphasis on epidemiologic and prevention studies.","['Catovsky, D']",['Catovsky D'],"['Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', '*Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 1995 Jan;7(1):3-11.,,,61,,"['BCL1', 'BCL2', 'PRAD1']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews recent developments in the treatment of adult leukemia with particular emphasis on reports published during the past year. Several new preparative regimens for transplantation are discussed. New chemotherapeutic strategies reported during the past year have included modulating the activity of cytarabine, the most active agent in autologous myelogenous leukemia, using other agents such as etoposide, mitoxantrone, and carboplatin, and attempting to overcome the multidrug resistance phenomenon. There has been further experience in the use of autologous marrow for transplantation, with several centers reporting excellent results for patients so treated. Biologic-based strategies are an exciting area of exploration. The implications of the landmark discovery of all-trans retinoic acid as a treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia continue to be investigated. Reports of the use of targeted monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, and other immunotherapies have generated the hope that these strategies might prove to be non-cross-resistant therapies and thus effective against residual disease following conventional chemotherapy.","['Volm, M D', 'Tallman, M S']","['Volm MD', 'Tallman MS']","['Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*therapy']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 1995 Jan;7(1):28-35.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these, such as the src kinases and the syk kinase, are known to be involved in this receptor-associated activation. In this paper we describe the search for other activation-associated tyrosine kinases by the ability to phosphorylate a cytoplasmic domain peptide of the Fc epsilon RI gamma-subunit. In utilizing a purification step previously used to isolate the 72 kDa syk kinase, we detected another kinase of molecular weight 79 kDa which we designated cd gamma kinase. The kinase was purified to near homogeneity by Heparin-agarose, Mono Q, and CM Sepharose chromatographies. The yield of enzyme was approx. 200 micrograms/10(9) cells. We characterized this kinase by its ability to phosphorylate both the cd gamma peptide (Km = 0.2 mM) and the cytoplasmic fragment of the Band III protein. The cd gamma kinase was distinguished from syk by inability to be precipitated by anti-syk antiserum and by partial peptide mapping. Cd gamma kinase was also distinguished from syk by cd gamma peptide and Band III substrate specificity. We identified the cd gamma kinase by Western blotting and by partial phosphopeptide mapping as Btk, the B-cell tyrosine kinase found to be defective in X-linked agammaglobulinemia.","['Price, D J', 'Kawakami, Y', 'Kawakami, T', 'Rivnay, B']","['Price DJ', 'Kawakami Y', 'Kawakami T', 'Rivnay B']","['Procept Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/16 00:00,1995/03/16 00:01,['1995/03/16 00:00'],"['1995/03/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(94)00213-X [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(94)00213-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Mar 16;1265(2-3):133-42. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(94)00213-x.,,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have identified many synergistic combinations of RA with cytostatics, cytokines and other inducers. A combination of RA with the crude thymus extract Thymex-L increased differentiation of HL-60 cells as confirmed by two functional assays and morphology, whereas the extract itself did not show any effect. The functional markers phagocytosis-associated chemiluminescence and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were more enhanced (up to 4-fold with 1000 micrograms/ml Thymex-L) than morphology. The effect was found over a wide RA concentration range (10(-11) - 10(-6) M) and was dependent on extract concentration. The half-maximal induction of both functional markers was reached at 400 micrograms/ml. To achieve the same effect with the combination in comparison with RA alone, an RA dose reduction of about 100-fold was estimated. The effect was also seen when the cells were pretreated with the thymus extract for two days. The enhancement of RA action by Thymex-L was not correlated with an increase of extracellular or intracellular RA concentration. The active compound in Thymex-L is heat stable and bigger than 5 kDa as confirmed by gelfiltration. The defined thymus peptides thymosin alpha 1, prothymosin alpha 1 and thymopentin were unable to synergistically enhance HL-60 differentiation. These data suggest that the treatment with a thymus extract can increase the sensitivity of HL-60 cells for RA.

The cohort has been reidentified and followed up, and now comprises 1003 Thorotrast-exposed patients. For all suspected haematological cases, cytological and histological material has been revised and malignant diseases have been reclassified. The numbers of cases of leukemia and other related haematological disorders were as follows: 16 acute myeloid leukemia (AML); 8 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); 1 acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL); 3 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); 4 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); 2 multiple myeloma (MM); 2 myelofibrosis (MF); 2 chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). Except for CLL, all cases might be Thorotrast-induced. (Expected number of leukemias: < 2.5.) The findings in the German, Japanese, Portuguese and Danish studies are very similar. Some of the characteristic features include a high incidence of AML with several erythroleukemias, many cases of MDS, and a relatively low incidence of CML. In several studies of leukemia induced by alkylating agents, erythroleukemia is also described as a prominent feature. The possibility exists that a phase of relative predominance of erythroid elements in the bone marrow may be a common and not an unusual feature in the pathogenesis of these secondary leukemias. The findings are also compared with histopathological data from a Danish control group of de novo leukemia patients and from atomic bomb survivors with radiation-induced leukemia. The relative frequency of AML is higher among the Thorotrast-exposed patients than among the Danish control group and the A-bomb survivors.

They were tested both in vitro, with cisplatin-sensitive and resistant cell lines, and in vivo, with cisplatin-sensitive and resistant tumors grafted i.p. in B6D2F1 mice. The rationale for this study was to test how charge, polarity and shape of the R side chain influence antitumor activity. Complexes carrying one or more ammonium groups on the side chain were all inactive. Derivatives with a carbamate function attached by the nitrogen atom, via a methylene group, to the ethylenediamine moiety ('N-bound' carbamate) were highly active in vitro and in vivo. The best results were obtained with these carbamates bearing hydrophobic substituents of intermediate size. Replacement of N-bound by O-bound carbamate or by urea groups led to decreased in vivo activity. Sulfonamide derivatives were all inactive. Good to excellent activities were also recorded for complexes bearing bulky bicycloalkyl substituents, without any functional group, attached to one ethylenediamine carbon atom. Thus, it is the steric features of the side chain rather than its polarity that appear to favor the antitumor activity of the complex.

Cell sizes ranged from 59 to 81 microns, and the doubling times varied from 31 to 65 hours. The lines stained with cytokeratin and showed expected negative staining for adenomarkers including B72.3 and carcinoembryonic antigen. All cell lines exhibited aneuploidy, with modal chromosome numbers between 40 and 81 and had multiple chromosomal aberrations. Significant production of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and interleukin-6 was seen.

This observation suggests that earlier treatment of HIV infection may be indicated and that strategies for enhancing drug targeting to the lymphoid tissue reservoris of HIV infection may be beneficial. To address this issue, we synthesized dioleoylphosphatidyl-ddC (DOP-ddC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (DPP-AZT), phospholipid prodrugs which form lipid bilayers and which are readily incorporated into liposomes. The anti-HIV activity of DOP-ddC was similar to that of ddC in HIV type 1-infected HT4-6C cells, but DPP-AZT was considerably less active than AZT in HT4-6C cells. Liposomes containing DOP-[3H]ddC or DPP-[3H]AZT administered intraperitoneally to mice produced greater levels of total radioactivity over time in plasma, spleen, and lymphoid tissue relative to the results with [3H]ddC and [3H]AZT, respectively. DPP-AZT administered intraperitoneally in liposomes as a single daily dose to mice infected with Rauscher leukemia virus prevented increased spleen weight and reverse transcriptase levels in serum with a dose-response roughly comparable to that of AZT given continuously in the drinking water. DOP-ddC, DPP-AZT, and lipid conjugates of other antiretroviral nucleosides may provide higher levels of drug over time in plasma and in lymph nodes and spleen, important reservoirs of HIV infection, and may represent an interesting alternative approach to antiviral nucleoside treatment of AIDS.","['Hostetler, K Y', 'Richman, D D', 'Sridhar, C N', 'Felgner, P L', 'Felgner, J', 'Ricci, J', 'Gardner, M F', 'Selleseth, D W', 'Ellis, M N']","['Hostetler KY', 'Richman DD', 'Sridhar CN', 'Felgner PL', 'Felgner J', 'Ricci J', 'Gardner MF', 'Selleseth DW', 'Ellis MN']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0676, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'HIV/*drug effects', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Rauscher Virus/*drug effects', 'Zalcitabine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.38.12.2792 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1994 Dec;38(12):2792-7. doi: 10.1128/AAC.38.12.2792.,"['R01 AI074057/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-27670/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-30457/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-24979/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)']",,,,,PMC188287,,,,,,,,,,

Ki67 expression correlated strongly with BrdU incorporation (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). Unlike the double-label with PI, containing with a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled antibody directed against a cell surface antigen did not significantly affect Ki67 quantification.

In a series of human acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cells, the effects of recombinant human (rh) SCF on AML cells were examined in short-term and long-term cultures. c-kit expression was detected in 26 of 31 AML cases, and short-term treatment of AML cells with rhSCF led to proliferation in 13 of 18 AML cases that expressed the c-kit product. In seven of the 13 cases showing proliferative response to rhSCF, AML cells were exclusively composed of immature blast cells. We therefore used the seven AML cases for examining the effect of rhSCF on the differentiation and proliferation of AML cells in a long-term culture. Proliferation of AML cells was found to be maintained with rhSCF more than 2 weeks in five of seven cases and 4 weeks in two cases, whereas most of the AML cells died before 2 weeks in the absence of rhSCF. Further, in four of five AML cases, all of which expressed the CD34 antigen and showed a proliferative response to rhSCF in a long-term culture, rhSCF appeared to promote differentiation of blast cells toward lineages of various cell types, such as granulocytic and/or monocytic and mast-cell lineages. These results suggest that, at least in a fraction of AML cases, rhSCF can induce not only proliferation but also differentiation of AML cells, and also that phenotypic manifestation of AML cells may not mean definite cell commitment but can be changed by stimulation with rhSCF.","['Ikeda, H', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Furitsu, T', 'Kitayama, H', 'Sugahara, H', 'Nishiura, T', 'Karasuno, T', 'Tomiyama, Y', 'Yamatodani, A', 'Kanayama, Y']","['Ikeda H', 'Kanakura Y', 'Furitsu T', 'Kitayama H', 'Sugahara H', 'Nishiura T', 'Karasuno T', 'Tomiyama Y', 'Yamatodani A', 'Kanayama Y', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Dec;21(13):1686-94.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its mode of action as an antitumor agent appears to be inhibition by its triphosphate (CPEC-TP) of CTP synthase, the enzyme which converts UTP to CTP. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of resistance to CPEC, a murine leukemia cell line resistant to CPEC (L1210/CPEC) was developed by N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced mutagenesis and subsequent selection by cultivation of the L1210 cells in the presence of 2 microM CPEC. Resistant clones were maintained in CPEC-free medium for 6 generations before biochemical studies were performed. The resistant clone selected for further studies was approximately 13,000-fold less sensitive to growth inhibition by CPEC than the parental cells, and the concentration of CPEC required to deplete CTP in the resistant cells was 50-fold higher than in the sensitive cells. A comparison of the kinetic properties of CTP synthase from sensitive and resistant cells indicated alteration in the properties of the enzyme from the latter; the median inhibitory concentration for CPEC-TP increased from 2 to 14 microM, Km for UTP decreased from 126 to 50 microM, and Vmax increased 12-fold from 0.2 to 2.3 nmol/mg/min. Northern blot analyses of polyadenylated RNA from the resistant and sensitive cells indicated a 3-fold increase in transcripts of the CTP synthase gene in the resistant line. Consistent with these alterations in the properties of the enzyme, the resistant cells exhibited significantly expanded CTP and dCTP pools (4- 5-fold) when compared with the sensitive cells. No change was observed, however, in the properties of uridine-cytidine kinase, the enzyme responsible for the initial phosphorylation of CPEC; despite this, however, cellular uptake of CPEC was greatly decreased, and phosphorylation of CPEC and its incorporation into RNA were 10-fold less than in the parental cells. These latter observations are most readily explained by feedback inhibition by the increased CTP levels of the resistant cells of uridine-cytidine kinase and/or of the membrane transport process used for initial entry of CPEC.","['Zhang, H', 'Cooney, D A', 'Zhang, M H', 'Ahluwalia, G', 'Ford, H Jr', 'Johns, D G']","['Zhang H', 'Cooney DA', 'Zhang MH', 'Ahluwalia G', 'Ford H Jr', 'Johns DG']","['Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Deamination', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Dec 1;53(23):5714-20.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', '69MO0NDN8K (cyclopentenyl cytosine)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.2 (CTP synthetase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphologically, AML M1 cases had the highest incidence of MDR1 gene expression (6 of 10 patients). Phenotypically, CD7 and CD34 were the only surface markers that were significantly associated with MDR1 gene expression (P < .01). In CD7+CD4-CD8- ALL, which is thought to originate from the lymphohematopoietic stem cell, expressed the MDR1 gene with a high incidence (six of eight patients), whereas three surface CD3+ and one CD4+CD8+ T-cell ALL (T-ALL) did not have detectable MDR1 transcripts. Only two cases of 13 B-precursor ALL had MDR1 mRNA, one of which had the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome. No association was observed between MDR1 gene expression and CD34 positivity in ALL. Our results that MDR1 mRNA was frequently expressed in CD7+ AML and CD7+CD4-CD8- ALL, together with the previous reports indicating clinical similarities between these leukemias, provides a clue to clarify a relationship between CD7+ AML and CD7+CD4-CD8- ALL.

To further understand the mechanisms regulating the proliferation of the malignant counterpart of B-cell precursors, namely precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we examined the adhesion to BM fibroblasts (BMF) of 19 cases of precursor-B ALL using a chromium labeling assay. Eleven of 19 cases showed greater than 10% binding to BMF (range 2.3% to 54.8%, mean 19.1%). Binding was increased approximately twofold by preincubation of BMF with tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-4, which also resulted in upregulation of expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on BMF. The mechanism of attachment was investigated using murine monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte integrins, principally the beta, integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5, which were demonstrated to be present on most cases by flow cytometry. Statistically significant inhibition of adhesion was observed with antibodies to the beta 1 common subunit, VLA-4, and VLA-5, whereas little effect was seen with antibodies to VLA-6 or the beta 2 integrin subunit. Preincubation of fibroblasts with an antibody to VCAM-1 (a ligand of VLA-4) inhibited leukemic cell binding in the majority of cases, which was an effect also observed on cytokine-stimulated BMF. However, a minority of cases, as well as the pre-B lines NALM-6 and KM-3, showed no evidence of inhibition of adhesion with anti-VCAM-1 antibodies. Treatment of BMF with antifibronectin antibody alone had little effect on ALL adhesion and did not enhance the inhibitory effect of anti-VCAM-1. These data indicate that precursor-B ALL cells bind to BM stroma through the beta 1 integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 and that this effect is partly mediated by VCAM-1 on stromal cells, although other undefined VLA ligands are also likely to be involved. Attachment of ALL cells to stroma is likely to play a key role in regulating the survival and growth of these cells through exposure to stromal cytokines.","['Bradstock, K', 'Makrynikola, V', 'Bianchi, A', 'Byth, K']","['Bradstock K', 'Makrynikola V', 'Bianchi A', 'Byth K']","['Haematology Department, Westmead Hospital, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67956-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Dec 1;82(11):3437-44.,,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identity of the cell surface receptor for the amphotropic envelope remains unknown and thus its importance in gene transfer is poorly understood. We have measured specific retrovirus binding to cells to study amphotropic virus receptor regulation in human CD34+ bone marrow (BM) progenitors and primitive CD34+CD38- human hematopoietic cells. The rat monoclonal antibody 83A25 recognizes an epitope common to the envelope glycoprotein of all classes of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Indirect fluorescent labeling of 83A25 allows flow cytometric analysis of specific virus-cell interactions and is an indirect measure of specific receptors. Using this assay, amphotropic virus binding to fresh CD34+ cells was minimal. However, when CD34+ cells were cultured with or without growth factors for 4 days, specific binding of amphotropic retrovirus was readily shown. Inclusion of interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and Steel factor in cultures increased the fluorescence associated with amphotropic virus binding by twofold to four-fold (mean fold increase 2.7 +/- 0.84). Virus binding to CD34+CD38- cells was shown only in those cells culture in IL-3, IL-6, and Steel factor. These results suggest that certain cytokines may cause an increase in the number and/or affinity of amphotropic receptors on primitive human hematopoietic cells. Upregulation of viral receptor expression may be one of the mechanisms by which cytokines enhance gene transfer into primitive BM cells.","['Crooks, G M', 'Kohn, D B']","['Crooks GM', 'Kohn DB']","['Division of Research Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis/*drug effects', 'Retroviridae/*physiology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67937-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Dec 1;82(11):3290-7.,['DK42694-0181/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cells defined by the expression of CD56 in the absence of CD3 were significantly increased at diagnosis and their levels in PB correlated with those of BM. By contrast, NK subsets defined by CD16 expression (CD16+ CD2+ and CD16+ CD2- NK-cell subsets) as well as T lymphocytes with NK activity (CD56+ CD3+), although increased in PB, displayed normal levels in BM. An additional observation of interest was the expansion of an immature NK population lacking CD16 Ag expression (CD56+ CD16-). AML cases were divided into two groups according to the absolute number of NK cells in PB; patients with the highest levels showed an increased proportion of blast cells in PB (p = 0.01), monocytic subtypes (p = 0.03), and expression of CD11b, CD14, and CD4 antigens (p = 0.05). Infections at diagnosis were not related to the level of NK cells. In 19 patients who achieved complete remission the number of CD56+ CD3- cells tended to be reduced to within the normal range. Other T-cell populations, including the CD4 naive and memory cells, were also explored, their distribution being normal in the PB of AML patients. By contrast, the cytotoxic subset CD8+/CD57+ was significantly increased (p < 0.001). These data point to the existence of marked alterations of NK cells in AML patients, possibly reflecting a host-tumor immunological interaction.","['Vidriales, M B', 'Orfao, A', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Hernandez, J M', 'Ciudad, J', 'Lopez, A', 'Moro, M J', 'Martinez, M', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Vidriales MB', 'Orfao A', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Gonzalez M', 'Hernandez JM', 'Ciudad J', 'Lopez A', 'Moro MJ', 'Martinez M', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01715050 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 Nov;67(5):217-22. doi: 10.1007/BF01715050.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean intensity of fluorescence (MIF) was calculated and correlated with sensitivity of blast cells to the lytic activity of allogeneic lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. CD54 antigen was expressed in all AML cases with an MIF of 11.2 while in ALL, though present in the majority of cases, it was absent in one case and expressed in less than 30% of blasts in two others, with an overall MIF of 3.0. CD58 expression was similar in both groups of patients, with an MIF of 7.6 in ALL and 7.0 in AML. In addition, in six of the ten ALL cases and in two of the 14 AML cases, leukemic blasts proved to be ""resistant"" to the cytotoxic activity of normal allogeneic LAK effectors. In these ""LAK-resistant"" patients, the CD54 antigenic expression was lower (p = 0.03) than in ""LAK-sensitive"" patients with an MIF of 1.7 vs 4.9 in ALL and 1.35 vs 12.9 in AML cases. Finally, blocking of CD54 and/or CD58 receptors on leukemic blasts resulted in a slight reduction of 51Cr release. Findings suggest that CD54 is differently expressed on myeloid and lymphoid blasts and that there is a correlation between CD54 MIF and susceptibility of blasts to the LAK activity.","['Raspadori, D', 'Lauria, F', 'Ventura, M A', 'Rondelli, D', 'Tura, S']","['Raspadori D', 'Lauria F', 'Ventura MA', 'Rondelli D', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia L. e A.

Nine patients in the early chronic-phase of CML were treated in a phase-II trial with escalating doses of rIFN beta. In parallel, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities of rIFN beta and rIFN alpha 2b were studied in vitro. rIFN beta exhibited a significantly higher antiproliferative activity on hematopoietic progenitor cells of CML patients in vitro than rIFN alpha 2b. In contrast, only very limited clinical antileukemic efficacy of rIFN beta was observed. None of the patients achieved a complete or partial hematologic response (0% response rate, 0-36% 95 C.I.). Primary resistance of CML patients to rIFN beta treatment was caused neither by antibody formation against the recombinant material nor by deficient IFN receptor targeting and/or signaling; Induction of serum levels of beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2-m) and neopterin after administration of rIFN beta was comparable to that seen after administration of rIFN alpha. However, rIFN beta treatment less effectively induced biosynthesis of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1-Ra) than rIFN alpha 2b. Thus, we conclude that rIFN beta at doses up to 12 MU/day s.c. is ineffective for treatment of chronic-phase CML. Further investigations into divergent biologic responses to various type-I interferons might help to elucidate mechanisms crucial for IFN action in patients with CML.","['Aulitzky, W E', 'Peschel, C', 'Despres, D', 'Aman, J', 'Trautman, P', 'Tilg, H', 'Rudolf, G', 'Huttmann, H', 'Obermeier, J', 'Herold, M']","['Aulitzky WE', 'Peschel C', 'Despres D', 'Aman J', 'Trautman P', 'Tilg H', 'Rudolf G', 'Huttmann H', 'Obermeier J', 'Herold M', 'et al.']","['3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University School of Medicine, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopterin/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Genes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-beta/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Interferons/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neopterin', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01715048 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 Nov;67(5):205-11. doi: 10.1007/BF01715048.,,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a few studies have analyzed the long-term survival in addition to the results of retreatment in patients relapsing after CR lasting more than 1 year. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data of 40 patients with Hodgkin's disease who were treated in a single institution and whose CR were > 1 year after primary chemotherapy. Therapy at relapse was not standardized: of 36 patients evaluable for response, 29 received second-line chemotherapy and 7 received radiotherapy alone. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of the patients obtained CR (median duration: 21 months). Sixty-eight percent of the complete responders relapsed again; however, long-lasting third and fourth remissions were observed. All of the 7 patients whose retreatment consisted of radiotherapy alone obtained CR, but only 1 is in continuous CR. The presence of nodular sclerosing histologic subtype, the absence of extranodal involvement and the use of hybrid MOPP/ABVD or ABVD alone as salvage treatment are independently associated with a higher CR rate and a higher probability of 5-year survival. The 5-year survival for all 40 patients is 49%. For the patients obtaining CR, the 5-year survival and the 5-year relapse-free survival are 76% and 25%, respectively. However, the survival curve continues to fall in the succeeding years because of third and fourth relapses and the occurrence of secondary acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of patients relapsing more than 12 months after primary chemotherapy can obtain second CR. Even if most of our patients eventually relapse, third and fourth CRs are not uncommon. However, the long-term survival is low and it is further diminished by secondary leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Salvagno, L', 'Soraru, M', 'Aversa, S M', 'Bianco, A', 'Chiarion Sileni, V', 'Pappagallo, G L', 'Fiorentino, M V']","['Salvagno L', 'Soraru M', 'Aversa SM', 'Bianco A', 'Chiarion Sileni V', 'Pappagallo GL', 'Fiorentino MV']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Centro Oncologico Regionale, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Vinblastine', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058620 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64905-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1993 Sep;4(8):657-62. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058620.,,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated strong tenascin expression in all peripheral lymphoid tissues, whereas it was barely detectable in the thymus and in bone marrow. In reactive lymph nodes, tenascin was mainly found in T-dependent zones, forming a variably close-woven reticular network corresponding to fibroblastic reticulum cells and blood vessels basal laminae, showing a partial co-localization with fibronectin. In B-dependent zones, tenascin was restricted to blood vessels. Using double-marker analysis, we performed a thorough study comparing tenascin expression in different compartments of lymphoid microenvironments.

In addition to surface expression of FVa, monocytes also contain intracellular FV as detected only after permeabilization by Triton X-100 by monoclonal antibody B10 directed specifically to the Cl domain not present in FVa. We sought to determine whether the presence of FV in peripheral blood monocytes is a result of de novo synthesis. Using in situ hybridization, no FV mRNA could be detected in monocytes, while in parallel control studies, factor V mRNA was detectable in Hep G2 cells and CD18 mRNA in monocytes. In addition, using reverse transcriptase and the polymerase chain reaction, no FV mRNA was detected in mononuclear cells or in U937 cells, but mRNA for factor V was present in Hep G2 cells using the same techniques.

The major clinical experience with fludarabine is in previously treated patients with CLL. In such patients the complete and partial response rate (CR + PR) is over 50%. These results were obtained with 5-day schedules of fludarabine 25 to 30 mg/m2/d. Subsequent schedules have explored once-a-week fludarabine and a 3-day schedule every 4 weeks. These strategies, in particular the once-a-week schedule, have obtained inferior results. The addition of prednisone has not been associated with an improvement in response rate or survival. The application of fludarabine to previously untreated patients demonstrated a CR + PR rate of 75% to 80%. The addition of prednisone did not improve the response rate or survival in this group of patients. A significant concern in patients with CLL treated with fludarabine is a decrease in the CD4 and CD8 counts. Despite median posttreatment counts of approximately 200 CD4 lymphocytes/microL, the incidence of infections in patients in remission off therapy is low. Major clinical activity has been demonstrated with fludarabine in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, in which more than one third of refractory patients achieve a CR or PR. Responding patients with anemia or thrombocytopenia have a marked improvement in blood counts. The duration of response has been long (> 30 months) in most responders. The early activity of fludarabine as a single agent in phase I/II studies in indolent lymphoma subsequently has been confirmed by a number of investigators. Fifty percent to 60% of patients with follicular lymphomas respond to fludarabine as a single agent. A number of these responses are complete despite the patients having received extensive prior treatment. A number of combination programs are being developed in CLL and indolent lymphoma. The combination of fludarabine with doxorubicin and prednisone has been developed and is being studied in phase I/II clinical trials. In addition, combinations of fludarabine and cytarabine with or without cisplatin based on elegant preclinical pharmacokinetic rationales have been applied to CLL with impressive cytoreductive activity but significant myelosuppression. A new combination of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone has been developed for use in lymphoma. Phase I studies demonstrated a high response rate, especially in follicular lymphomas, with a number of patients achieving complete remission. Subsequent phase II studies demonstrate a response rate of 89% in patients with indolent lymphoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Keating, M J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Robertson, L E', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Dimopoulos, M', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Cabanillas, F', 'Gregoire, V', 'Yang, L Y', 'Gandhi, V']","['Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Robertson LE', 'Kantarjian H', 'Dimopoulos M', 'McLaughlin P', 'Cabanillas F', 'Gregoire V', 'Yang LY', 'Gandhi V', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Oct;20(5 Suppl 7):13-20.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used flow cytometry to estimate the proportion of such cells and normal granulocytes with G-CSF binding activity. Recombinant human G-CSF was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Granulocytes showed higher binding to the G-CSF than lymphocytes. Leukemic cells obtained from 17 to 21 patients with AML bound specifically to G-CSF, but leukemic cells with lymphoid malignancies did not. Our results showed positive correlation with date obtained by the isotopic G-CSF receptor assay. With this method, leukemic cells need not be isolated; they can be distinguished from lymphocytes or granulocytes on the cytometry screen. Radioisotopes are not needed.

Mutant colony size was distinctly bimodal with 35% of spontaneous mutants growing as small colonies and 65% large. The proportion of small colonies increased only slightly to 41% in EMS-treated cultures but to 64% after MMC treatment. Mutations were analysed by Southern and Northern blotting. Digestion of DNA with the restriction enzyme, Nco I, revealed that many mutants had lost a 6.3-kb fragment which constituted the loss of the entire tk gene. Almost all of the EMS-induced large-colony mutants analysed (9/10) retained the tk+ allele suggesting the presence of an intragenic mutation. Of the small-colony mutants, half (6/12) had lost the tk+ gene and presumably other genes affecting growth and half retained the tk+ allele suggesting point mutations in both the tk gene and other sites in the genome affecting growth. A very different spectrum of mutation was induced with MMC. Only 1/12 of the large-colony mutants were due to intragenic mutation, the remaining large-colony mutants having lost the tk+ allele while all the small-colony mutants had lost the tk+ gene presumably with the deletion extending to genes essential for normal growth. Northern blot analysis showed no changes in the size of tk transcript in any mutants. Alterations in the amount of tk mRNA were not detectable since all mutants produced an mRNA of similar size and amount, which may indicate the production of an abnormal mRNA from the tk- allele. Unlike cell-mutation assays that use hemizygous loci (such as hprt+/0) for detecting potential chemical carcinogens, the mouse-lymphoma tk+/- assay allows the recovery of both intragenic and intergenic mutations thus enabling the detection of both point mutagens such as EMS and potent clastogens like MMC.","['Davies, M J', 'Phillips, B J', 'Rumsby, P C']","['Davies MJ', 'Phillips BJ', 'Rumsby PC']","['BIBRA Toxicology International, Carshalton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/*toxicity', '*Gene Deletion', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/*toxicity', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', '*Point Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(93)90154-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(93)90154-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1993 Dec;290(2):145-53. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(93)90154-8.,,"['0 (Mutagens)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '9H154DI0UP (Ethyl Methanesulfonate)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",,,['tk'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since murine Ly1-positive peritoneal or lymphoma B cells strongly express IL-10, we examined malignant cells from patients with acute and chronic leukemias by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the expression of IL-10 mRNA. High expression was found in three out of four samples from CD10+, CD5- common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) cells, whereas T-ALL samples generally did not contain IL-10 mRNA. In contrast to the murine system, only low levels of IL-10 expression were seen in 10 out of 11 samples from patients with CD5+ CLL. Myeloid derived cell lines were negative for IL-10. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) positive and negative Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines showed heterogenous IL-10 expression: BL cell lines with a nonactivated germinal center phenotype (CD10+, CD77+, CD23-, CD30-, CDw70-) expressed little or no IL-10, whereas EBV-positive and negative BL cell lines with an activated phenotype (CD77-, CD23+, CD30+, CDw70+) expressed easily detectable amounts of IL-10 mRNA. The highest expression of IL-10 was found in EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). Upon superinfection with non-defective EBV, the EBV-negative cell line BL 41 up-regulated IL-10 expression. Thus, in vivo IL-10 expression is not restricted to cells showing a specific (CD5+) phenotype. IL-10 may play an important role in c-ALL. The expression of IL-10 in BL cell lines is correlated to an activated phenotype in vitro and is independent of the EBV carrier status. EBV can induce IL-10 expression.","['Finke, J', 'Ternes, P', 'Lange, W', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Dolken, G']","['Finke J', 'Ternes P', 'Lange W', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Dolken G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/microbiology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1852-7.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the two follicular lymphoma cases in which BCL-2/IgH transcripts could not be detected by RT-PCR, PCR amplification of genomic DNA indicated this was not due to primer selection. In addition, non-expression was confirmed at the protein level by immunoperoxidase studies. We therefore conclude that these represent true negative cases.

Most fetal cells, whatever their origin, possess the ability to bind and to endocytose the protein. This property, which is considered to be lost in differentiated cells of the adult, may be resumed in tumoral cells and is due to the expression of specific AFP receptors at the cell surface. Cytochemical and immunological approaches, combined with in situ hybridization, were used to investigate the specific uptake and synthesis of human AFP in several classes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in several malignant cell lines of hematopoietic origin. With the exception of quiescent T lymphocytes, all cells investigated specifically bound AFP. Both normal and malignant blood mononuclear cells expressed mRNA transcripts of AFP which were translated into the protein during a well established period of cellular growth. These results suggest that an AFP/receptor autocrine system might operate in normal and malignant blood mononuclear cells.

When compared to Eskol cells, the IREs-4 cells were resistant to the antiproliferative effect of type I interferons as well as interferon induced protection against LAK cells. Treatment of IREs-4 with type I interferon did not induce MHC antigens, although both MHC class I and II antigens were induced in Eskol. Binding studies indicated the presence of equal numbers of high affinity binding sites with similar affinities on both cell lines. The resistant phenotype appears to result from an intracellular event which is essential to interferon signal transduction.

Incorporation of Aza-dC into DNA was detectable in all cases. In 17 samples we evaluated the DNA integrity of leukemic cells exposed to Aza-dC using alkaline elution techniques.

DNA-ALS increased in cells exposed to Aza-dC concentrations from 0.1 to 1 microgram/ml but did not further increase at 10 micrograms/ml. A plateau in the levels of DNA-ALS was also seen in human K562 cells exposed to increasing concentrations of Aza-dC from 5 to 10 micrograms/ml, whereas in these cells Aza-dC incorporation into DNA increased with increasing Aza-dC concentrations. Therefore, DNA-ALS caused by Aza-dC are not simply the result of the chemical decomposition of azacytosine molecules incorporated into DNA, but are presumably the result of a saturable DNA repair mechanism (e.g., glycosylases) leading to formation of the apyrimidinic sites.","['Limonta, M', 'Colombo, T', 'Damia, G', 'Catapano, C V', 'Conter, V', 'Gervasoni, M', 'Masera, G', 'Liso, V', 'Specchia, G', 'Giudici, G']","['Limonta M', 'Colombo T', 'Damia G', 'Catapano CV', 'Conter V', 'Gervasoni M', 'Masera G', 'Liso V', 'Specchia G', 'Giudici G', 'et al.']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(93)90045-m [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Nov;17(11):977-82. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90045-m.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other multidrug resistant cell lines also showed elevated 170 kDa kinase activity, such as the human breast cancer MCF-7/Adr(R) and murine melanoma B16/Adr(R) cells, but the activity was not present in murine leukemia P-388 sensitive or multidrug resistant cells.","['Sampson, K E', 'McCroskey, M C', 'Abraham, I']","['Sampson KE', 'McCroskey MC', 'Abraham I']","['Cell Biology Department, Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI 49001.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'KB Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphothreonine/analysis', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240520403 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1993 Aug;52(4):384-95. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240520403.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '58HV29I28S (KT 5720)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,['MDR1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The partial characterization and purification of the C215 target molecule from solubilized COLO 205 membranes indicated that it is an integral membrane glycoprotein of the non-mucin type. The denatured antigen appeared as a major 40-kDa form in Western blots after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and migrated as a monomeric 36-kDa species after the reductive cleavage of intramolecular disulfide bridges. Using a five-step procedure, the antigen was purified 4,300-fold from COLO 205 tumors raised in nude mice to a homogeneity of 95% when assessed by capillary electrophoresis. Removal of N-linked carbohydrate by peptide:N-glycosidase treatment did not affect the visualization of the purified antigen in immunoblots but resulted in a faster migration in the SDS gels. The amino acid sequence was partially determined. Seventeen contiguous NH2-terminal amino acids were identified and coincided exactly with residues 82-98 of the GA733-2 protein cloned by Szala et al. (Szala, S., Froehlich, M., Scollon, M., Kasai, Y., Steplewske, Z., Koprowski, H., and Linnenback, A. J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 3542-3546). Therefore, the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein was used to prepare overlapping synthetic peptides that cover the entire extracellular domain in order to identify the C215 epitope. A likely epitope, close to the NH2 terminus and corresponding to the first distinct hydrophilic stretch after the putative signal sequence, was identified in a peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, GA733-2 cDNA was used for the cloning of the C215 protein from COLO 205 cells and the subsequent transfection to K36.16 mouse T cell leukemia cells. The transfected cells were C215 reactive in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and a 42 kDa band was visualized in Western blots under both non-reducing and reducing conditions. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the C215 antigen and other members of the GA-733 family, some of which are currently being used as targets in clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies. The mammalian expression system described here will enable further studies into the biological role of this protein and the construction of animal models in order to develop optimal therapeutic strategies.","['Bjork, P', 'Jonsson, U', 'Svedberg, H', 'Larsson, K', 'Lind, P', 'Dillner, J', 'Hedlund, G', 'Dohlsten, M', 'Kalland, T']","['Bjork P', 'Jonsson U', 'Svedberg H', 'Larsson K', 'Lind P', 'Dillner J', 'Hedlund G', 'Dohlsten M', 'Kalland T']","['Department of Immunology, Kabi Pharmacia AB, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)80515-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Nov 15;268(32):24232-41.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutants with altered substrate specificities.,23585-92,"RNases H are traditionally thought to degrade RNA only in RNA-DNA hybrid form. We found that the wild-type Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase (RT) was capable of degrading RNA in RNA-RNA duplexes as well as in RNA-DNA hybrids, as assayed by in situ gel techniques. Escherichia coli RNase H does not degrade the RNA-RNA duplex in this assay, while E. coli RNase III, a double-strand-specific ribonuclease, does. The apparent specific activity of M-MuLV RT on RNA-RNA duplexes is similar to that on RNA-DNA hybrids. Neither the DNA polymerase domain nor the RNase H domain of RT expressed individually exhibited this RNA-RNA activity. We have generated a series of mutations in the RNase H domain of M-MuLV RT, expressed the mutant enzymes in E. coli, and assayed these mutants for various activities. All RTs were as active as the wild type in the oligo(dT):poly(rA) DNA polymerase assay, and many retained both nuclease activities. Two enzymes with mutations at the carboxyl terminus of the RNase H domain retained RNA-DNA activity, but not RNA-RNA activity. Another mutant enzyme showed the opposite phenotype, retaining RNA-RNA, but not RNA-DNA, nuclease activity. Thus, we were able to genetically separate the two activities. These results may be helpful in defining enzyme-substrate interactions.","['Blain, S W', 'Goff, S P']","['Blain SW', 'Goff SP']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Endoribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity']",1993/11/05 00:00,1993/11/05 00:01,['1993/11/05 00:00'],"['1993/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)49503-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Nov 5;268(31):23585-92.,['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (ribonuclease III, E coli)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(-)-SddC is six times more potent against HIV-1 and at least 1.7-fold less cytotoxic than (+)-SddC. Metabolism studies showed that the intracellular accumulation of the active triphosphate form of (-)-SddC is more than 2-fold greater than that of (+)-SddCTP in H-9 cells. In contrast, (+)-SddCTP is approximately 1.5 times more potent than (-)-SddCTP as an inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using a rRNA template (Ki = 0.22 and 0.034 microM, respectively) and gapped DNA (Ki = 0.53 and 1.02 microM, respectively). The enantiomers are comparable as substrates for incorporation into DNA by the RNA-dependent HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; however, neither analog is incorporated as readily as dCTP. The above observations do not explain the difference in the anti-HIV potency between the enantiomers. A novel 3'-5' exonuclease was partially purified from the cytosol of H-9 cells and assayed for the removal of (+)- and (-)-SddCMP-terminated DNA. Removal of (+)-SddCMP was approximately two to three times faster from 3'-terminals of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, whereas on DNA/RNA substrates, the exonucleolytic cleavage of (+)-SddCMP proceeded approximately six times faster than that of (-)-SddCMP. This result correlates with the observed difference in the anti-HIV effect between the two compounds and suggests that this novel enzyme may be an important determinant of their antiviral activities.","['Skalski, V', 'Chang, C N', 'Dutschman, G', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Skalski V', 'Chang CN', 'Dutschman G', 'Cheng YC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*Antiviral Agents', 'Base Sequence', 'Exonucleases/metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lamivudine', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligoribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Zalcitabine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism']",1993/11/05 00:00,1993/11/05 00:01,['1993/11/05 00:00'],"['1993/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)49454-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Nov 5;268(31):23234-8.,['CA44358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because this block was observed whether the secretagogue acted through receptors (i.e. antigen and the muscarinic agonist, carbachol) or by direct activation of intracellular mechanisms (i.e. A23187, A23187 in combination with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and thapsigargin), the inhibitors appeared to act at a step distal to the mobilization of Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C. All secretagogues caused the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 40-kDa protein, whereas the inhibitors caused a hyperphosphorylation of this protein. Therefore, both tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities appear to regulate this phosphorylation which may, in turn, regulate secretion. The 40-kDa protein was identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase-like protein on the basis of its reactivity to anti-mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies. In addition, when cells were stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylated and the immunoreactive protein comigrated as a doublet on one-dimensional and as multiple phosphorylated forms on two-dimensional gel-electrophoretic systems.","['Santini, F', 'Beaven, M A']","['Santini F', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Exocytosis', 'Hexosaminidases/metabolism', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1993/10/25 00:00,1993/10/25 00:01,['1993/10/25 00:00'],"['1993/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)41586-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Oct 25;268(30):22716-22.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) assays using RNA from placental tissue, HEL cells and human platelets. Exon 2b encodes two alternative translation initiation codons which may render exon 2b-containing CD36 mRNA untranslatable. To test this hypothesis, we transfected COS-1 cells with an exon 2b-containing CD36 cDNA construct. Using anti-CD36 polyclonal antibody, we were able to detect an immunoreactive protein, consistent in size with the mature protein observed in transfected COS-1 cells.

These proteins which are differentially expressed according to the cell type, constitute a dynamic structure which not only contributes to the cell architecture but also defines its state of differentiation. Furthermore, numerous observations have shown that the IF network is altered in cells transformed by tumorigenic viruses. We have previously demonstrated that HTLV-I (human T-cell leukemia virus type I) transformed T cells were characterized by a high level of vimentin transcripts and that the HTLV-I Tax regulatory protein was able to transactivate the vimentin promoter transfected into Jurkat and HeLa cells. To enlarge the scope of this study, we investigated the effects of the Tax protein on the expression and organization of IF of epithelial cells in which the IF network is composed of vimentin and cytokeratin. To this aim, we have developed a model of epithelial cells (HeLa) stably expressing the tax sequences which were introduced by using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Half of the Tax expressing HeLa clones were loosely adherent to the culture surface and were displaying remarkable morphological alterations, as ascertained by the presence of round-shaped or spindle-shaped cells. In these cells, expression of this viral protein correlated to a pronounced disruption in the distribution of both the vimentin and the cytokeratin networks, as shown by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analysis. Indeed, vimentin filaments appeared to be concentrated in discrete spots throughout the cytoplasm, while the cytokeratin filaments appeared to form a dense ring around the nucleus.

To test whether two defective RTs--one carrying a mutation in the RNaseH domain and the other with a mutation in DNA polymerase--could work together to complete viral DNA synthesis, we generated phenotypically mixed virions of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) that contained two kinds of mutant RTs. One RNaseH catalytic site mutant complemented both tested DNA polymerase mutants and small amounts of intact viral DNA were generated. This demonstrates that retroviral DNA synthesis can be completed--albeit inefficiently--when DNA polymerase and RNaseH activities are provided by separate RT molecules. Other RNaseH mutants failed to complement, suggesting that some aspects of the RNaseH domain are essential to RT's DNA polymerase function. Phenotypically mixed virions were also used to demonstrate that RT and integrase (IN) can be provided by separate polyprotein precursors and complete the early stages of retroviral replication.","['Telesnitsky, A', 'Goff, S P']","['Telesnitsky A', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Genetic Complementation Test', 'Integrases', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/*genetics/pathogenicity', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Proviruses/enzymology/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Virion/enzymology/genetics', 'Virulence', 'Virus Integration']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Nov;12(11):4433-8.,['NCI CA30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,['pol'],,PMC413742,,,,,,,,,,

A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in patients with cancer.,446-514,"Recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) products (e.g. aldesleukin, teceleukin) are nonglycosylated, modified forms of the endogenous compound. IL-2 acts as a pleiotropic mediator within the immune system, having a variety of effects via specific cell surface receptors. The interaction of IL-2 with the IL-2 receptor induces proliferation and differentiation of a number of T lymphocyte subsets, and stimulates a cytokine cascade that includes various interleukins, interferons and tumour necrosis factors. Antitumour effects of IL-2 appear to be mediated by its effects on natural killer, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) and other cytotoxic cells. In vivo and in vitro effects of IL-2 seem to be dependent to a large extent on the environment; many studies have reported conflicting results, perhaps due to diverse populations of effector cells, the availability of other cytokines that have synergistic or inhibitory influences, and the dosage regimens used. The recombinant products appear to be biologically indistinguishable from native IL-2 in vitro and in vivo; the former induce minor antibody formation but this does not appear to alter functional properties. In patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, IL-2 therapy achieves average objective response rates of 20% (range 0 to 40%), with a complete response rate of about 5% (range 0 to 19%). Response duration varies considerably but can be durable (lasting for > 12 months), with some patients remaining in complete response for > 60 months. It is unclear at present whether higher dosage regimens improve clinical response, or whether combination therapy with other agents and/or adoptive therapy is beneficial. Survival duration may depend on the risk factors present, with poorer performance status and more than one site of metastases associated with shorter survival times. Patients with metastatic malignant melanoma receiving IL-2 as monotherapy show an average objective response rate of 13% (range 3 to 24%); however, objective response rate averages 30% (range 4 to 59%) when IL-2 is used in combination with other agents. Overall median survival appears to be about 10 months. Preliminary data indicate that IL-2 produces a lower response rate in patients with refractory colorectal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Adverse effects accompanying high dose, intravenous IL-2 therapy can be severe, with cardiovascular, pulmonary, haematological, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, renal and/or dermatological complications frequently requiring doses to be withheld.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Whittington, Ruth', 'Faulds, Diana']","['Whittington R', 'Faulds D']","['Adis International Limited, 41 Centorian Drive, P.O.

Flow cytometric analysis of the sialyl Le(x) and sialyl Le(a) antigens was also performed on the same cell lines. The sialyl Le(x) antigen was expressed on 14 of 15 epithelial cancer cell lines, and the sialyl Le(a) antigen was detected on 8 of them. The message of Fuc-TIII was detected in most of the epithelial cancer cell lines (14 of 15), which correlated with the surface expression of these carbohydrate determinants. In addition, the messages of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVI were detected in most epithelial cancer cell lines, while the message of Fuc-TV was undetectable in most of them. On the other hand, all leukemia cell lines were positively stained for sialyl Le(x), but none of them was stained for sialyl Le(a) in flow cytometry. The messages of Fuc-TIV++ were detected in all leukemia cell lines tested. Small quantities of Fuc-TIII, V, and/or VI messages were also detected in some leukemia cell lines in reverse transcriptase mediated-polymerase chain reaction analysis. These studies indicate that alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase activities in epithelial cancer and leukemia cell lines are mixtures of multiple molecular species of alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferases. It is natural that epithelial cancer cells contain a significant amount of Fuc-TIII mRNA and leukemia cell lines contain Fuc-TIV mRNA, since their normal counterparts, normal epithelial cells and leukocytes, respectively, are known to contain these fucosyltransferases. The unexpectedly frequent occurrence of Fuc-TIV mRNA in epithelial cancer cell lines may be related to their retro-differentiation associated with tumorigenesis. Another unexpected finding was a weak but significant expression of the alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferases Fuc-TIII, V, and/or VI in leukemia cell lines detected by reverse transcriptase mediated-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Since these enzymes are known to be capable of synthesizing the sialyl Le(x) determinant, this finding implies a possibility that some of them may be involved in the synthesis of sialyl Le(x) in leukemia cells.","['Yago, K', 'Zenita, K', 'Ginya, H', 'Sawada, M', 'Ohmori, K', 'Okuma, M', 'Kannagi, R', 'Lowe, J B']","['Yago K', 'Zenita K', 'Ginya H', 'Sawada M', 'Ohmori K', 'Okuma M', 'Kannagi R', 'Lowe JB']","['Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/enzymology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'E-Selectin', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fucosyltransferases/*analysis', 'Gangliosides/*analysis', 'Hepatoblastoma/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'P-Selectin', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Nov 15;53(22):5559-65.,['1R01GM47455/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fourteen adult patients with ALL in first remission received intensive chemotherapy consisting of mitoxantrone 5 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily for 3 days, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) 3 g/m2 IV over 2 hours every 12 hours x 4 on days 1 and 2, vincristine 2 mg IV on day 1, solumedrol 50 mg IV twice daily for 5 days, and G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously daily starting on day 4 until granulocyte recovery. Their outcome was compared with that of 14 consecutive patients who received the same intensification chemotherapy, but without G-CSF. The latter patients had been entered on the same ALL protocol from April 1990 through June 1991. RESULTS: G-CSF administration was associated with a significant shortening in the duration of neutropenia. The number of days to granulocyte recovery above 0.5 x 10(3)/microliters was 14 in the G-CSF group versus 18 days in the historical group (P < 0.001). Two episodes of documented infections were observed in the G-CSF group compared with four episodes in the historical group. Death during intensification therapy occurred in 2 of 14 patients in the historical group, but in none of the 14 patients receiving G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF as an adjunct to intensive chemotherapy in adults with ALL in first remission yielded positive results. Future studies incorporating growth factors supportive care during remission, induction, and consolidation may reduce treatment-related morbidity and mortality, increase the dose-intensity delivery of therapy, and potentially improve patient outcome.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Estey, E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Anaissie, E', 'Beran, M', 'Pierce, S', 'Robertson, L', 'Keating, M J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Anaissie E', 'Beran M', 'Pierce S', 'Robertson L', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19931115)72:10<2950::aid-cncr2820721015>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Nov 15;72(10):2950-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19931115)72:10<2950::aid-cncr2820721015>3.0.co;2-b.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the Ph status of the various CML cell populations. The mean proportions of normal and CML CD34+ cells expressing CD33 and CD38 were not significantly different. However, a significantly greater proportion of CML CD34+ cells expressed HLA-DR antigens compared with normal CD34+ cells and the level of HLA-DR expression per CML cell was abnormally high. When the sequence of acquisition of these antigens on normal and CML CD34+ cells was evaluated using 3-colour fluorescence analysis, the results suggested that HLA-DR was expressed earlier than CD38 or CD33 and these findings were confirmed by following the acquisition of CD38 and CD34+/DR+/CD38-subpopulation during liquid culture. We performed cytogenetic studies on CD34+ subpopulations in 6 cases. In 4 cases there were some Ph-negative metaphases detectable in the CD34+/DR-subpopulation (range 12.5 to 60%). In the CD34+/DR+ fractions, however, all 6 patients had only Ph-positive metaphases and only 1/5 patients had detectable Ph-negative metaphases in the CD34+/CD38-subpopulation.

Both cytokines suppressed the primary and secondary colony formation in methylcellulose culture of leukemic blast progenitors. The recovery of clonogenic cells in suspension culture was also suppressed by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The primary colony formation in methylcellulose reflects the terminal divisions of leukemic blast progenitors, while the secondary colony formation in methylcellulose and the clonogenic cell recovery in suspension have been considered to reflect their self-renewal capacity. Therefore, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are considered to be effective in suppressing not only the terminal divisions but also self-renewal of leukemic blast progenitors.

The K051 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigens (CD13 and CD33), a platelet-associated antigen (CD41), and an erythroid antigen (glycophorin A). The K052 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigens (CD13, CD14, and CD33), lymphoid markers (CD2, CD5, and CD7), and HLA-DR. Chromosome analysis of both cell lines showed a 17p- chromosome. Both cell lines were investigated for aberrations of the p53 gene and the N-ras gene. A p53 mutation detected in both cell lines consisted of a C-->T substitution in codon 248. An N-ras mutation detected only in the K052 cell consisted of a G-->C substitution in codon 13. Expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) was also investigated by the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MDR1-mRNA was more highly expressed by the K052 cell than the K051 cell, being equivalent to that in HEL cells. The functional MDR1-protein against vincristine was also observed, and its function was inhibited by verapamile and Cyclosporin A. The K052 cells were capable of phenotypic or morphologic differentiation after being incubated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3. In contrast, the K051 cells responded phenotypically to retinoic acid.

However, sialyl Lex antigen, the carbohydrate ligand for E-selectin, has been hardly detectable on these cells, at least when typical anti-sialyl Lex antibodies were used for detection. One of the MoAbs (2F3, IgM), which we raised against a chemically synthesized sialyl Lex glycolipid preparation, is found to react selectively to CD4+ CD45RObright+ CD45RA- helper memory T cells among peripheral lymphocytes in healthy individuals. The specificity of the antibody is in clear contrast to that of the hitherto reported typical anti-sialyl Lex antibodies FH-6 and SNH-3. These classical anti-sialyl Lex antibodies were known to react to a subset of natural killer (NK) cells, but were not reactive with any particular subset of resting peripheral T or B cells of healthy individuals if the cells were not activated. On the other hand, the newly generated 2F3 antibody specifically reacted to helper memory T cells, and did not react to NK cells, B cells, or any T cells other than helper memory T cells. When tested against the sialyl Lex-active glycolipid antigen, the reactivity of 2F3 was not significantly different from that of the classical anti-sialyl Lex antibodies. But when tested against oligosaccharides prepared from cellular glycoproteins, 2F3 detected a distinct set of O-linked oligosaccharides, which were not reactive to the classical anti-sialyl Lex antibodies. Our results suggest that various molecular species of sialyl Lex antigens are present on carbohydrate side chains of cellular glycoproteins, and that helper memory T cells express a distinct type of sialyl Lex antigen that is defined by 2F3 but is not efficiently detected by other typical anti-sialyl Lex antibodies. Among cultured lymphocytic leukemia cells, the adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells preferentially expressed the 2F3-defined antigen, and acute lymphocytic leukemia cells rarely expressed the antigen. The cultured ATL cells expressing the 2F3-defined antigen showed a clear E-selectin-dependent adhesion to cytokin-activated endothelial cells, and the 2F3-defined sialyl Lex antigen served as a ligand for E-selectin as ascertained by the clear inhibition of adhesion with the 2F3 antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ohmori, K', 'Takada, A', 'Ohwaki, I', 'Takahashi, N', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Maeda, M', 'Kiso, M', 'Hasegawa, A', 'Kannagi, M', 'Kannagi, R']","['Ohmori K', 'Takada A', 'Ohwaki I', 'Takahashi N', 'Furukawa Y', 'Maeda M', 'Kiso M', 'Hasegawa A', 'Kannagi M', 'Kannagi R']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E-Selectin', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lewis X Antigen/*analysis/immunology/physiology', 'Skin/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81929-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 1;82(9):2797-805.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic Leukemia Working Party. European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group.,3211-9,"We studied the clinical course of 130 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (89 males and 41 females) in the European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group (EBMT) registry who received transplants before January 1, 1988 and who subsequently had evidence of recurrent leukemia. All patients had received a pretransplant conditioning regimen including total body irradiation (TBI). The first evidence of relapse was cytogenetic only in 74 (57%) patients and hematologic in 56 (43%). The overall actuarial survival from relapse was 36% at 6 years, with a significantly higher proportion of survivors among female patients (53% v 30%; P < .002). In univariate analysis, the 6-year probability of survival was 52% for patients with cytogenetic relapse and 30% for patients relapsing in chronic phase (CP), while no patient who relapsed in advanced phase (AP or BC) survived more than 3.5 years from relapse (P < .0001). The actuarial survival of patients relapsing before 6 months, between 6 and 12 months, and later than 12 months after transplant was 27%, 26%, and 45%, respectively (P < .002). Among patients with cytogenetic relapse, partial or complete disappearance of Ph-positive cells occurred in 40% of untreated patients and in 42% of those treated with interferon (IFN). However, IFN therapy significantly delayed progression toward hematologic disease. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 25% of patients who received IFN for relapse into CP, while only one minor cytogenetic response was reported in patients on conventional chemotherapy. For patients presenting with cytogenetic relapse as well as for those in hematologic relapse, IFN therapy significantly improved the 2-year probability of survival. However, long-term survival for IFN-treated patients in either group was not different from long-term survival in comparable patients not receiving IFN therapy. Twenty-nine patients of this series underwent a second bone marrow transplant (BMT) and the projected survival at 4 years after the second transplant is 28%. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, four factors remained significantly associated with survival: disease phase at relapse (P < .0001), duration of time interval from BMT to relapse (P = .0001), interferon therapy at relapse (P = .0024), and patient sex (P = .0032). This retrospective study provides evidence that some patients who relapse after BMT may benefit from treatment with IFN; a second BMT may offer the chance of cure. Data from this analysis may be useful in designing future prospective trials on posttransplant CML relapse.","['Arcese, W', 'Goldman, J M', ""D'Arcangelo, E"", 'Schattenberg, A', 'Nardi, A', 'Apperley, J F', 'Frassoni, F', 'Aversa, F', 'Prentice, H G', 'Ljungman, P']","['Arcese W', 'Goldman JM', ""D'Arcangelo E"", 'Schattenberg A', 'Nardi A', 'Apperley JF', 'Frassoni F', 'Aversa F', 'Prentice HG', 'Ljungman P', 'et al.']","['Institute of Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79491-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):3211-9.,,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-170 expression was analyzed in correlation with CD34 expression and clinical response. Thirty of 52 patients expressed P-170 (58%). Eight of 30 P-170+ as compared with 16 of 22 P-170- patients achieved a complete remission (CR) (27% v 73%, P = .003). In 21 of 30 P-170+ patients, expression of the CD34 antigen was observed in greater than 10% of the blast cells, as compared with 14 of 22 P-170- patients (70% v 64%, P > .05). The CR rate of CD34+ and CD34- patients was 31% and 76%, respectively (P = .006). In AMLs that simultaneously expressed both P-170 and CD34, the CR rate was worse as compared with those negative for P-170 and CD34 (5% v 63%, P = .004). In 12 patients (8 P-170+, 4 P-170-) CD34 and P-170 expression were further characterized by double fluorescence studies. It was shown that P-170+ cells were largely, but not exclusively, restricted to the CD34+ cell population. For the 8 P-170+ AML samples, the median ratio of P-170+/P-170- in CD34+ cells was 4.845 (range, 0.60 to 25.00) as compared with 0.135 (range, 0.02 to 0.67) in CD34- cells. In these 12 AML samples, the presence of functional resistance as defined by reduced daunorubicin accumulation was evaluated in CD34+ and CD34- AML cells. In 8 of 8 P-170+ patients, intracellular daunorubicin accumulation in CD34+ AML blast cells was lower than in CD34- cells, and it increased after cyclosporin addition. No difference of intracellular daunorubicin accumulation was observed between CD34+ and CD34- AML cells of 4 P-170- patients. These data indicate that P-170 expression in AML with a heterogeneous CD34+ phenotype seems predominantly present in CD34+ AML blast cells.","['te Boekhorst, P A', 'de Leeuw, K', 'Schoester, M', 'Wittebol, S', 'Nooter, K', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Sonneveld, P']","['te Boekhorst PA', 'de Leeuw K', 'Schoester M', 'Wittebol S', 'Nooter K', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sonneveld P']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Phenotype']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79483-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):3157-62.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such lymphomas differ from the original leukemia in both histology and clinical behavior. Studies seeking to define the clonal relationship between the cells of the two malignancies in any one patient have yielded conflicting reports. We examined the clonal relationship between the early and late neoplastic cells of a patient who underwent Richter's transformation. In contrast to the original leukemia cells, the secondary high-grade lymphoma was CD5-. However, both the leukemia cells and the evolved RS lymphoma expressed surface IgM lambda reactive with Lc1, a murine monoclonal antibody specific for a supratypic cross-reactive idiotype encoded by a subset of human Ig variable region genes of the VH4 subgroup. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chain variable region genes expressed by both leukemia and lymphoma cells show that the CD5- B-cell lymphoma constitutes a clonal expansion of mutant cells derived from the original CD5+ B-cell leukemia. Moreover, certain sets of somatic mutations distinguish the Ig variable region genes used by RS lymphoma from those expressed by the CLL B cells. This is the first study to establish the clonal relationship between CLL and RS lymphoma through primary structural analyses of the expressed Ig genes.","['Cherepakhin, V', 'Baird, S M', 'Meisenholder, G W', 'Kipps, T J']","['Cherepakhin V', 'Baird SM', 'Meisenholder GW', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine-0663, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0663.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Syndrome']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79480-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):3141-7.,"['CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TW00011/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the capacity of malignant cells from patients with AML to maintain close proximity to sites of growth factor production and retention by binding to BM stromal elements, including fibroblasts and extracellular matrix proteins. Leukemic cells from all cases of AML adhered to BM fibroblast (BMF) monolayers (mean +/- standard error [SE] percentage binding, 30.9% +/- 2.5%; n = 23) and to fibronectin and laminin (mean +/- SE percentage binding, 28.0% +/- 4.1% [n = 11] and 21.5% +/- 2.3% [n = 8], respectively). Binding to bovine and human collagen type 1, vitronectin, hyaluronic acid, and albumin was minimal. Analysis of binding mechanisms indicated that very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) and VLA-5 were responsible for AML cell binding to fibronectin. Binding to laminin could be inhibited by antibody to the alpha chain of VLA-6. In contrast, AML cell adhesion to BMF monolayers was not impaired by blocking antibodies to either beta 1 or beta 2 integrins used alone, although the combination of anti-CD11/CD18 and anti-VLA-4 inhibited binding in more than 50% of cases. When anti-VLA-5 was added in these cases, mean +/- SE inhibition of binding of 45.5% +/- 9.1% (P < .001) was observed. Binding of AML cells to extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin is predominantly beta 1-integrin-dependent, but AML cell adhesion to BMF relies on the simultaneous involvement of beta 1 and beta 2 integrins as well as other currently unrecognized ligands.","['Bendall, L J', 'Kortlepel, K', 'Gottlieb, D J']","['Bendall LJ', 'Kortlepel K', 'Gottlieb DJ']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Integrin beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Laminin/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79478-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):3125-32.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity mediated by patient LAK cells against AML blasts, but not against ALL cells and autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, was enhanced 1.5-fold to 9.3-fold by OKT3 in all AML patients studied. The following findings suggest that the major target molecule on AML cells for OKT3-coated LAK cells is the high-affinity Fc receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI; CD64): (1) susceptibility to killing by OKT3-coated effector LAK cells segregated with target cell expression of CD64; (2) preincubation of AML blasts with monomeric OKT3 (murine IgG2a), the Fc portion of which is known to have preferential binding affinity to CD64, resulted in lysis by autologous T cells that were not spontaneously cytotoxic; (3) OKT3-dependent increase in lysis of primary and relapsed AML cells by autologous T-cell clones correlated with the amount of target cell expression of CD64; (4) anti-leukemic cytotoxicity of OKT3-coated T cells could partially be inhibited by monomeric human Ig, the natural ligand of CD64; and (5) expression of CD64 (Fc gamma RI) on fresh AML cells could be increased by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IFN-alpha translating into further enhancement of lysis by autologous OKT3-coated LAK cells. Nonmalignant CD34+ cells sorted from peripheral blood were found to lack expression of CD64 and hence were not affected by OKT3-triggered T-cell targeting, as detected by colony formation assays. In conclusion, the in vitro data presented provide a rationale for the combined clinical use of recombinant interleukin-2, IFN-gamma, and low doses of CD3 MoAb to eliminate AML cells while sparing nonmalignant hematopoietic progenitor cells, for example, in the setting of purging procedures for autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Notter, M', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Bremer, S', 'Thiel, E']","['Notter M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Bremer S', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Free University of Berlin, Klinikum Steglitz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Muromonab-CD3/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis/*physiology']",1993/11/15 00:00,1993/11/15 00:01,['1993/11/15 00:00'],"['1993/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79477-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):3113-24.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, the clone with anti-Sm activity used a V lambda III gene having 97% homology with a germinal gene. Overall, these results attempt to establish the relationship between frequent self-reactivity observed in CD5+ B-CLL and V gene usage.

While SCF did not have stimulatory effects in the cells of 7 patients, it stimulated primary and secondary blast colony formation in methylcellulose culture and the recovery of clonogenic cells in suspension cultures from 21 patients. SCF stimulated leukemic blast progenitors in a manner almost comparable to or more prominently than that of other CSFs, namely, IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF, in 9 patients. One patient responded to SCF but not to the other CSFs. In another 11 patients, SCF was less effective on leukemic blast progenitors than the other CSFs tested. To explain the variable effects of SCF, we investigated the relation between the phenotype of leukemic blasts and responsiveness to this agent; the response was significantly higher in patients with CD34-positive blasts than in those with CD34-negative blasts. These results imply that responsiveness to SCF differs among leukemic blast progenitors originating at different hematopoietic stages. In some ANLL patients, SCF showed synergy with other CSFs, suggesting that SCF may be involved in the cytokine network affecting leukemic hematopoiesis.","['Nara, N', 'Tanikawa, S', 'Nagata, K', 'Hamaguchi, H', 'Tomiyama, J']","['Nara N', 'Tanikawa S', 'Nagata K', 'Hamaguchi H', 'Tomiyama J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Division', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/pathology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Aug;58(1-2):27-35.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study this phenomenon, we employed a system of donor and acceptor templates in which homologous strand transfer can occur from a homopolymeric sequence, positioned internally on the donor template. Our results indicate that reverse transcriptases from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) are all able to catalyze strand transfer from this sequence. Catalysis of this reaction is not dependent upon ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity, since an RNase H-deficient form of HIV-RT is able to catalyze the reaction efficiently. Additionally, N-ethylmaleimide, which inhibits RNase H but not polymerase activity, did not inhibit the template switching by either the native or RNase H-deficient forms of HIV-RT. Our data further indicate that template switching may be promoted by RT pausing at a specific site on the donor template. Conditions that increase RT pausing at this site also increase template switching. These results suggest that transient RT pausing at specific sites on the viral genome during reverse transcription may promote template switches that in turn lead to recombination.","['Buiser, R G', 'Bambara, R A', 'Fay, P J']","['Buiser RG', 'Bambara RA', 'Fay PJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Rochester, NY 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', '*RNA, Viral', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Ribonuclease H', '*Templates, Genetic']",1993/10/19 00:00,1993/10/19 00:01,['1993/10/19 00:00'],"['1993/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(93)90033-A [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(93)90033-a [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Oct 19;1216(1):20-30. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(93)90033-a.,"['AI 27054/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 49573/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-one patients with haematological disorders were studied with measurements of blood absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) 24 h after a single subcutaneous injection of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (rhGM-CSF).

The median increase in blood ANC 24 h after cytokine administration was 15.9 x 10(9)/l (range 3.7-34.2) in 18 patients with normo- or hypercellular marrows and only 0.4 x 10(9)/l (range 0.0-11.2) in 13 patients with hypocellular marrows (P < 0.00001). An increase in ANC or more than 5 x 10(9)/l was predictive for normo- or hypercellular bone marrows with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 84%, respectively. A subsequent pilot study in selected patients with prolonged neutropenia was performed. The ANC increment in 12 cases before chemotherapy correlated to the grade of neutropenia and may predict the risk of febrile neutropenia.

The genes encoding pp125FAK have been cloned previously from both chicken and mouse cDNA libraries, and the deduced amino acid sequences are nearly identical (94%). Two synthetic peptides derived from sequences at the carboxyl terminus of chicken pp125FAK were conjugated to ovalbumin to generate rabbit heteroantisera. Human pp125FAK was immunodetected in both T and B lymphocytes with these antisera. A basal state of pp125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in T and B lymphocytes, and its expression level was in general augmented among human T- and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma lines. Additionally, the full-length sequence of human T-cell pp125FAK (huT-FAK) was derived from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. huT-FAK is structurally identical with both mouse and chicken FAK, and shares 95% amino acid identity with chicken pp125FAK and has 97% homology with the mouse sequence. This high degree of evolutionary conservation between species suggests that pp125FAK is likely to have a crucial function in the cell. Expression of the full-length huT-FAK gene in COS cells showed an immunologically indistinct human pp125FAK protein compared with the endogenous primate pp125FAK. Taken together, the data indicate that this structurally conserved human T-cell pp125FAK likely functions in T- and B-cell lineages, and its altered expression in human lymphocyte tumor cell lines may contribute to their transformed phenotype.","['Whitney, G S', 'Chan, P Y', 'Blake, J', 'Cosand, W L', 'Neubauer, M G', 'Aruffo, A', 'Kanner, S B']","['Whitney GS', 'Chan PY', 'Blake J', 'Cosand WL', 'Neubauer MG', 'Aruffo A', 'Kanner SB']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98121.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/enzymology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1993.12.823 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1993 Nov;12(9):823-30. doi: 10.1089/dna.1993.12.823.,,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2 protein, mouse)']",,['GENBANK/L13616'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the agent was inactive against HIV-2 and a pyridinone-resistant strain (A17) of HIV-1, a strain which is cross-resistant to several structurally diverse members of a common pharmacologic class of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The compound selectively inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase but not HIV-2 reverse transcriptase. Combinations of thiazolobenzimidazole with either AZT or ddI synergistically inhibited HIV-1 induced cell killing in vitro. Thiazolobenzimidazole also inhibited the replication of the Rauscher murine leukemia retrovirus.

Using synthetic peptides corresponding to nucleotide sequence 729-957 (amino acid sequence 243-319) of FeLV-A/Glasgow-1, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of this part of the viral surface glycoprotein were investigated. The region contains two highly conserved domains separated by a variable region (VR4), when compared with FeLV of subgroups B and C, and an epitope known to be involved in virus neutralization is located in the N-terminal conserved domain. Five murine monoclonal antibodies generated by immunization with virus were found to be directed to this domain and four were virus-neutralizing. Polyclonal mouse, rabbit and cat anti-FeLV antisera, which were virus-neutralizing, were directed to B-cell epitopes in the peptides. To determine if those synthetic peptides could induce neutralizing antibodies, rabbits were immunized with the peptides, singly or in combination. Antibody responses were measured by ELISA for anti-peptide, anti-FeLV and anti-gp70 activity, by immunoblotting, by membrane immunofluorescence and by virus-neutralization tests. Virus-neutralizing antibodies were induced by FeLV gp70 peptides and there was a synergistic effect on antibody production when a combination of peptides covering amino acid sequence 243-319 of FeLV-A was used. In a second experiment, six rabbits and six cats were immunized with a combination of two peptides, which covered the above-defined FeLV gp70 sequence. Comparisons were made of the responses to these peptides incorporated into immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs) via myristic acid tails, inoculated with 'empty' ISCOMs, or with Al(OH)3. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) had a very strong potentiating effect on the induction of antibodies and immunization with peptides incorporated into ISCOMs was superior to immunization using adjuvants other than CFA. It is very promising that not only in rabbits, but also in the natural host of FeLV, the cat, anti-FeLV gp70 (peptides) antibodies could be induced by FeLV gp70 peptides.","['Weijer, K', 'Pfauth, A', 'van Herwijnen, R', 'Jarrett, O', 'Meloen, R H', 'Tomee, C', 'Osterhaus, A D']","['Weijer K', 'Pfauth A', 'van Herwijnen R', 'Jarrett O', 'Meloen RH', 'Tomee C', 'Osterhaus AD']","['The Netherlands Cancer Institute (Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Huis), Division of Immunology, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Viral/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cats/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'ISCOMs/*immunology', 'Immunity, Active', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0264-410X(93)90384-A [pii]', '10.1016/0264-410x(93)90384-a [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1993;11(9):946-56. doi: 10.1016/0264-410x(93)90384-a.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (ISCOMs)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)']",,,['env'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All histological results confirmed the clinical diagnosis of CLL. The distribution of the CD5- subjects according to the different staging categories proposed by Rai, Binet and Mandelli was similar to that of CD5+ subjects. Ten patients received standard chemotherapy with Chlorambucil (CHL) and Prednisone (PDN). All achieved partial remission, although one of these patients later died of disease progression; 80 months after diagnosis.

We have previously shown that FLT4 is expressed as transcripts of 4.5 and 5.8 kb in several human fetal and adult tissues. Here we show that these transcripts encode two polypeptides, FLT4s (short) and FLT41 (long), which are proteolytically processed in transfected cells and leukemia cells and which have different carboxy terminal tails. The 3' coding region of the 5.8 kb mRNA was found to be 65 codons longer than that of the the 4.5 kb mRNA. Analysis of the genomic structure of the region encoding the two carboxy termini revealed that the two transcripts are generated by alternative polyadenylation and subsequent alternative splicing during RNA processing. Our findings thus show regulation of FLT4 structure in the carboxy terminal tail considered important for receptor function. The significance of the two forms may relate to the role of additional potential autophosphorylation sites in the FLT4 long form.","['Pajusola, K', 'Aprelikova, O', 'Armstrong, E', 'Morris, S', 'Alitalo, K']","['Pajusola K', 'Aprelikova O', 'Armstrong E', 'Morris S', 'Alitalo K']","['Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Nov;8(11):2931-7.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3)']",,,['FLT4'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The study population comprised 45 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 13 children with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 28 age-matched healthy controls. The geometric mean mutant frequency for ALL patients was 7.8 x 10(-6), which was significantly higher than that for AML patients (1.7 x 10(-6)) or for healthy controls (1.1 x 10(-6)). Fifteen patients with ALL showed a high mutant frequency above 10 x 10(-6), although 10 of them had completed their treatment at least 24 months earlier. Moreover, repeated measurements of mutant frequency at intervals of 12 or more months revealed that the values were very stable. Structural hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) gene alterations, as determined by Southern blot analysis, were seen in 23% (12/52) of mutant clones derived from ALL patients, but not in those from the controls.

Recently, it has been suggested that hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) may enhance the effects of cytostatic drugs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We therefore studied the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) combined with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), daunorubicin (DNR), mitoxantrone (MXT), or etoposide (VP-16) by using the MTT assay. The results were compared with in vitro clonogenic assays. Briefly, AML cells of nine patients were incubated in the presence or absence of G-CSF, IL-3, or GM-CSF under serum-free conditions for 24 hours. Next, for the MTT assay, Ara-C (final dilution range: 0.0024-240 micrograms/ml), DNR (final dilution range: 0.05-3.2 micrograms/ml), MXT (final dilution range: 0.05-3.2 micrograms/ml), or VP-16 (final dilution range: 0.1-100 micrograms/ml) were added and incubated for 48 hours. Cell survival was determined and IC75 values (75% reduction as compared to control cultures) were calculated. For clonogenic assays, the three lowest drug concentrations were used. After 48 hours, the clonogenic response was determined in serum-free, semi-solid cultures with G-CSF, IL-3, or GM-CSF. The results obtained by the MTT assay showed no significant enhancement of cytotoxicity by HGF on cytostatic drug preincubated cells compared to cytostatic drugs alone. The results obtained by the clonogenic assays showed increased cytotoxicity of Ara-C combined with G-CSF, IL-3, or GM-CSF. The median IC75 values of Ara-C decreased from 0.056 to 0.0168 microgram/ml with G-CSF (p = 0.01), from 0.108 to 0.0168 microgram/ml with IL-3 (p = 0.004) and from 0.12 to 0.0204 microgram/ml for GM-CSF (p = 0.02). Only moderate enhanced cytotoxicity was observed when VP-16 was combined with IL-3 (p = 0.036) or GM-CSF (p = 0.036), but not with G-CSF. No enhanced cytotoxicity of DNR and MXT to clonogenic AML cells was found when these agents were combined with HGF stimulation. The results indicate that the MTT assay underestimates HGF enhanced cytotoxicity of Ara-C or VP-16 to clonogenic cells. Therefore, the assay is not useful for accurately detecting differences of clonogenic response due to the proliferative status of cells. In this paper, the potential explanations for the failure of the MTT assay are discussed.","['te Boekhorst, P A', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Sonneveld, P']","['te Boekhorst PA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sonneveld P']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Technical Report']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Colorimetry/methods', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stimulation, Chemical', '*Tetrazolium Salts', '*Thiazoles']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Oct;7(10):1637-44.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the temporal pattern of infiltration of a CD10- pre-B leukemia line (G2) in various murine tissues and the progression of the disease in the whole animal were monitored by quantifying human CD44 mRNA expression by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Irradiated scid mice were injected intravenously with 10(6) G2 cells and killed 3 days to 10 weeks later. After 2 weeks, leukemic cells were found mostly in bone marrow, but also in lung. At 6 to 7 weeks, spleen and lung contained 30% human RNA, while peripheral blood, liver, and kidney contained 2-3%. Infiltration to brain and thymus was observed at 8-9 weeks. In terms of the whole animal, spleen and liver were the major sites of tumor burden. The induction of CD10 expression was previously observed in transplanted CD10- G2 leukemic cells recovered from scid thymus at 10-12 weeks, which corresponds to the terminal stage of disease. In this study, the CD10 expression on the leukemic cells was monitored at earlier time points by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. Induction of CD10 was first observed in bone marrow, spleen, peripheral blood, and liver at 6-7 weeks (10-fold), at the time of the onset of dissemination of the leukemia. Despite the presence of 30% human RNA in lung at 6-7 weeks, CD10 induction was not significant in that site before 10 weeks. Increased levels of CD10 were seen in all tissues between 8 and 10 weeks; the highest levels were observed in leukemic cells proliferating in thymus (113-fold) and in those found in circulation. These findings suggest that initial induction of CD10 occurs in hematopoietic tissues at the time of rapid proliferation of the leukemic cells and their infiltration of several tissues. At later time points, the increase in CD10 expression is seen on the leukemic cells found in all peripheral organs suggesting an association with disease progression.","['Ishii, E', 'Greaves, A', 'Grunberger, T', 'Freedman, M H', 'Letarte, M']","['Ishii E', 'Greaves A', 'Grunberger T', 'Freedman MH', 'Letarte M']","['Division of Immunology/Cancer Research, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'G2 Phase/physiology', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neprilysin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Oct;7(10):1592-601.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two- and three-color fluorescence experiments indicated that CD13+/CD33+ myeloid cells from 19 out of the 36 patients were positive for CD56 in 12-77% of the cells. In contrast, no CD56 positivity was documented in myeloid cells from bone marrow (BM) of healthy donors. Immunocytochemical staining (APAAP technique) of CML peripheral blood (PB) and BM slides showed that CD56 expression was detectable from the myelocyte stage with the strongest staining in the metamyelocyte stage. Neutrophils were negative both by flow cytometry and APAAP analysis. In individual CML patients, an increasing number of CD56+ cells were recovered with progressively higher density cuts (1.065-1.077 g/ml), supporting the concept that the antigen level tends to increase during myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, 19% of CML patients coexpressed CD56 and CD34 antigens in 10-45% of the CD34+ cells. The myeloid nature of CD56+/CD34+ CML cells has been ascertained by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) assays on CD56+ cells sorted on FACS. Furthermore, in six out of eight CML patients in whom we performed a comparative BM and PB analysis, we found that the CD56 expression was brighter and the number of positive cells significantly higher in the peripheral blood myeloid cells as compared to their BM counterpart. In short-term liquid cultures, low doses (50 U/ml) of alpha interferon down-regulated the CD56 expression in CML cells, accompanied by a significant reduction of the Ph positivity. In conclusion, the expression of CD56 on CML myeloid elements seems to represent an aberrant phenomenon which could affect the cell homing mechanisms and, probably, the pattern of tumor cell dissemination. In patients with CD56+ CML, its detection could be further used as a means of monitoring patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, since its reappearance is associated with early relapse of the disease.","['Lanza, F', 'Bi, S', 'Castoldi, G', 'Goldman, J M']","['Lanza F', 'Bi S', 'Castoldi G', 'Goldman JM']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, RPMS, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Oct;7(10):1570-5.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This includes differentiation, proliferation, migration, and formation of extracellular matrix. TGF-alpha has been demonstrated in circulating eosinophils from the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and in differentiating promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro. Whether TGF-alpha production also occurs in normal human blood cells is not known. Northern blot analysis showed that normal human white blood cells consistently expressed the TGF-alpha gene in 47 out of 47 donors. Cell preparations enriched in mononucleated cells, and devoid of granulocytes, showed no TGF-alpha mRNA. In situ hybridization experiments assigned the TGF-alpha gene expression to the eosinophils; 100% of the eosinophils and no other cell types were specifically recognized by the complementary human TGF-alpha riboprobe. White blood cells, incubated at 37 degrees C for up to 6 hours, released immunoreactive TGF-alpha to the incubation medium, as determined by ELISA. In contrast, no TGF-alpha protein was detected in the incubation medium of mononuclear cells. It is concluded that TGF-alpha is constitutively produced and released by normal human blood eosinophils.

Pretreatment of macrophages with either 1,25(OH)2D3 or 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-26,27-F6-D3 (pre-infection treatment) increased productive HIV infection about 3.5-fold; 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 increased levels about 4.7-fold.

Studies with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have demonstrated efficacy in accelerating neutrophil recovery in patients rescued from myeloablative therapy.

We have now performed a phase II trial to assess whether granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) results in accelerated engraftment in this group of patients. Twenty-three consecutive patients with recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received G-CSF (10.5 +/- 1.2 micrograms/kg per day) following myeloablative therapy consisting of etoposide (60 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg), and either carmustine (15 mg/kg) or fractionated total body irradiation (1200 cGy). All patients received bone marrow grafts which had been purged with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against either B or T cell determinants plus complement.

By measuring the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells at the beginning of culture and at various time points, and by combining this information with a viable cell count, it was possible to determine: (1) the number of viable cells; (2) their rate of proliferation; (3) their number of cell divisions; and (4) the maintenance of cells in a viable state over a period of time.

For these studies, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene under the control of the spleen necrosis virus U3 promoter was used as target sequence since it allows selection for either the functional or the inactivated gene. Our results indicate that after one round of retroviral replication, the tk gene is inactivated at an average rate of 0.08 per cycle of replication. Southern blotting revealed that the majority of the mutant proviruses resulted from gross rearrangements and that deletions of spleen necrosis virus and tk sequences were the most frequent cause of the gene inactivation. Sequence analysis of the mutant proviruses suggested that homologous as well as nonhomologous recombination was involved in the observed rearrangements. Some mutations consisted of simple deletions, and others consisted of deletions combined with insertions. The frequency at which these mutations occurred during one cycle of retroviral replication provides evidence indicating that Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors may undergo genetic rearrangement at high rates.

Phosphoaminoacid analysis of the in vitro phosphorylated proteins and Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with an antiphosphotyrosine mAb show that, in contrast with other lymphocyte receptors (CD3, CD4, IL-2R), CD5 coimmunoprecipitates a serine kinase activity. Our results show also that preactivation of cells through the CD3/TCR complex induces a rapid (detectable in 1-3 min) and transient (returns to basal levels after 10-15 min) increase in the kinase activity associated with CD5 immunoprecipitates. This CD3-induced increase in CD5-associated kinase activity correlates with an increase in CD5 phosphorylation. Furthermore, activation with soluble anti-CD5 mAb induces also an increase in the kinase activity associated with this receptor. In contrast with the increase observed after activation with CD3, after activation with CD5 the increase in the kinase activity peaks after 10 min and is maintained for 1 h.

Binding of c-kit ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) to c-kit receptor (c-kitR) is known to activate c-kitR tyrosine kinase, thereby leading to autophosphorylation of c-kitR on tyrosine and to association of c-kitR with substrates such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In a human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1, c-kitR was found to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, activated, and associated with PI3K without the addition of SCF. The expression of SCF mRNA transcript in HMC-1 cells was not detectable by means of PCR after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) analysis, suggesting that the constitutive activation of c-kitR was ligand independent. Sequencing of whole coding region of c-kit cDNA revealed that c-kit genes of HMC-1 cells were composed of a normal, wild-type allele and a mutant allele with two point mutations resulting in intracellular amino acid substitutions of Gly-560 for Val and Val-816 for Asp. Amino acid sequences in the regions of the two mutations are completely conserved in all of mouse, rat, and human c-kit. In order to determine the causal role of these mutations in the constitutive activation, murine c-kit mutants encoding Gly-559 and/or Val-814, corresponding to human Gly-560 and/or Val-816, were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line, 293T cells. In the transfected cells, both c-kitR (Gly-559, Val-814) and c-kitR (Val-814) were abundantly phosphorylated on tyrosine and activated in immune complex kinase reaction in the absence of SCF, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of c-kitR (Gly-559) or wild-type c-kitR was modest or little, respectively.

Mice have endogenous murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) in their chromosomes. We detected the gene expression of long terminal repeats (LTRs) of MuLVs. Brains, livers and spleens were taken from young (3 months old) and old (27 months old) male C57BL/6 mice. In addition to these control (C) mice, we also determined gene expression in dietary restricted (DR) mice, in which rates of aging are known to be slowed. RNA was extracted from the tissues and converted into cDNA. The MuLV-LTR portion of cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Gene expressions of young mice were found to be tissue-specific. Expressed LTRs from brains, livers and spleens were that of 370 base-pairs (bp), those of 370 and 620 bp, and those of 370, 400 and 620 bp, respectively. Old mice of C group, however, decreased tissue specificity: expressed LTRs became those of 370-400 bp in any tissues. In contrast the tissue specific gene expression was conserved in old DR mice which had to get prolonged life span and decreased lymphoma incidence. Thereby, gene expression of endogenous retroviruses appears to change during aging and to be modifiable by life-prolonging DR. It may be therefore used as a biomarker of aging in mice. Humans are known to have similar gene elements like MuLV.

To elucidate the structural features of the receptor that are important for hormone binding and signaling, we have developed a series of site-specific antibody probes. These antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides homologous to six exoplasmic domains and one cytoplasmic domain of the murine receptor and were affinity-purified by binding to their respective peptide antigen, immobilized on agarose. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the recombinant receptor expressed transiently in COS-7 cells is synthesized as three protein species of 62, 64, and 66 kd, consistent with previous observations. Importantly, probing the endogenous receptor in both virally transformed erythroleukemia cells and normal erythroid cells demonstrated similar 62- to 66-kd receptor species. The affinity-purified antibodies also recognized several antigenically related proteins. An examination of the capacity of the antireceptor antibodies to block receptor activation by Epo revealed that antibodies to five of the six exoplasmic domains blocked the receptor. This was reversed with excess Epo. Inhibition of receptor activation by antibody probes to five discrete hydrophilic domains suggests that receptor function may be critically dependent on the structural integrity (conformation) of the entire exoplasmic portion.","['Bailey, S C', 'Feldman, L', 'Romanowski, R R', 'Davis, K L', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Bailey SC', 'Feldman L', 'Romanowski RR', 'Davis KL', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['New England Deaconess Hospital, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/*analysis/immunology/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epitopes/analysis/immunology/physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/analysis/*immunology/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Nov;21(12):1535-43.,['DK 38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were then washed and seeded at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates that contained a variety of test samples. The plates were incubated for 7 days, and the cells were then washed, transferred to ELISA plates, and fixed. Megakaryocyte growth was determined by an ELISA for the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, an abundant membrane protein found on cells committed to the megakaryocyte lineage. The growth factor IL-3 was found to produce a very strong signal in this assay. The addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6, stem cell factor (SCF), or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to low levels of IL-3 also stimulated megakaryocyte growth, as measured by IIb/IIIa expression. Plasma from patients with aplastic anemia was also stimulatory in this assay, and showed marked synergy with IL-3.

In addition, MGF is also known to enhance the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 on the in vitro proliferative activity of myeloid leukemic cells. MGF synergizes with a number of other cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-9 in sustaining the proliferation of growth factor dependent M-07e cells. In order to explore the molecular basis of this synergistic activity and to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of c-kit expression, we investigated the effects of GM-CSF, IL-3 and MGF on c-kit mRNA and protein levels in M-07e cells. GM-CSF, unlike MGF and IL-3, induced a transient but significant increase of c-kit mRNA levels. Moreover, following MGF and GM-CSF treatment, c-kit protein expression in M-07e cells decreased, whereas all the other cytokines tested are unable to modulate c-kit protein. These data together with the results of protein turnover analysis suggest that MGF and GM-CSF regulate c-kit expression at the post-transcriptional level.

As shown by single colony transfer experiments, mafosfamide-resistant clones promoted by SCF have a significantly higher replating capacity as compared with mafosfamide-resistant clones grown without SCF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Mangoni, L', 'Almici, C', 'Caramatti, C', 'Rizzoli, V']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Mangoni L', 'Almici C', 'Caramatti C', 'Rizzoli V']","['Department of Hematology, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110827 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 Jul;11 Suppl 2:170-4. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110827.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sources of human B cells were surgically removed tonsils from normal individuals and peripheral blood from patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Tonsil B lymphocytes were purified by E rosetting and complement-mediated cytotoxicity with selected monoclonal antibodies and subsequently fractionated by a Percoll density gradient into in vivo activated and resting cells. The latter cell fractions were subsequently cultured with or without stimuli. GM-CSF was detected by a bioassay, G-CSF by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. In vivo and in vitro activated B cells produced GM-CSF, whereas in vivo activated, but not in vitro activated, B lymphocytes produced G-CSF. These results were confirmed by Northern blot experiments with cDNA probes specific for GM-CSF and G-CSF genes. Many B cell suspensions from B-CLL patients produced GM-CSF or G-CSF only following Staphylococcus Aureus Cowan I (SAC) stimulation; in some cases, a spontaneous production or no production at all of the two cytokines was detected.

Our first aim was to study the growth characteristics of cord blood progenitors. We have evaluated the number of cycling cells with the thymidine suicide technique and the production, by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells, of some cytokines involved in the proliferation of progenitor cells, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).

Our second aim was to elucidate whether the cord blood totipotent stem cell population or the committed progenitors could be expanded in vitro. Our results showed that in cord blood the number of early progenitors, as evaluated by the number of mixed lineage colony forming units (CFU-Mix), by the CD34+CD33- subsets and the expression of the c-kit, is higher than in bone marrow.

Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B-CLL stromal cells produced G-CSF and GM-CSF in amounts similar to normal stromal layers, whereas IL-6 production was significantly decreased. Using the blast-colony forming cell assay (BI-CFC) and the classical colony-forming unit granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) assay, we found that: (1) marrow stromal cells of B-CLL were able to support only 25% of the BI-CFC growth supported by normal marrow stromal cells; (2) this anomaly was partially corrected by the addition of exogenous IL-6; (3) the colony-stimulating activity (CSA) of the conditioned medium (CM) of B-CLL stromal cells was lower than that of normal CM; (4) that this was the result of the presence of an inhibitor rather that of a growth factor defect; (5) this inhibition could be abrogated by addition of anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) neutralizing antibody; (6) this antibody corrected the deficient colony supportive activity of the B-CLL stromal cells; (7) TGF-beta production by marrow stromal cells was significantly increased in CLL compared with normal; and (8) that this was not caused by the effect of the B-CLL lymphocytes on the stromal cells. It is concluded that this increased TGF-beta production in B-CLL is probably responsible for the decreased IL-6 production by stromal cells and for the inhibiting activity on hematopoietic precursors as well. We hypothesize that TGF-beta generated at a high level by B-CLL marrow stromal cells could play a major role in the pathophysiology of the BM failure seen in advanced stages of B-CLL.","['Lagneaux, L', 'Delforge, A', 'Dorval, C', 'Bron, D', 'Stryckmans, P']","['Lagneaux L', 'Delforge A', 'Dorval C', 'Bron D', 'Stryckmans P']","['Service de Medecine Interne, Institut J.

Because GVHD is frequently refractory to treatment, the early identification of high-risk patients could have significant clinical value. To identify such patients, we examined early immunologic recovery in 136 patients with hematologic malignancies who received anti-T12 (CD6)-purged allogeneic bone marrow over a 9-year period. The majority of patients received marrow from HLA-matched sibling donors after ablation with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. No patients received any immune suppressive medications for GVHD prophylaxis. The fraction and absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) expressing the CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD56 surface antigens were determined weekly by immunofluorescence analysis in patients beginning 8 to 14 days (week 2) after marrow infusion. Results in patients who did or did not subsequently develop GVHD post-BMT were compared. Within 2 weeks of marrow infusion, patients who developed grades 2-4 GVHD had significantly higher percentages and absolute numbers of CD8+ T cells and a lower fraction of CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells than individuals who remained free of GVHD. Thirty-five percent of patients whose PBL were greater than 25% CD8+ in the second posttransplant week developed GVHD, compared with only 3% of patients who had < or = 25% CD8+ cells (odds ratio 37.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 397). A subgroup of patients at very high risk for GVHD could be identified based on the combined frequency of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in blood. Seventy-five percent of patients with greater than 25% CD8+ cells and < or = 45% CD56+ cells during week 2 post-BMT developed GVHD, compared with only 11% of the remaining patients (odds ratio 24.9; 95% CI, 5.3 to 117.0). None of the 23 patients with both less than 25% CD8+ cells and greater than 45% CD56+ cells in the second posttransplant week developed grades 2-4 GVHD.

Analysis of immune reconstitution early after BMT is useful in predicting the onset of GVHD and can help direct the implementation of treatment strategies before the appearance of clinical manifestations.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulates the progenitors of granulocytes and accelerates their recovery from bone marrow suppression induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation. On the other hand, G-CSF stimulates proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells as well as normal granulocytes in vitro. We designed a method to determine if G-CSF affects the incidence of myeloid leukemias induced by irradiation and the types of leukemias induced according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification in RFM/MsNrs mice. Administration of G-CSF (2 micrograms/d for 7 days) after a single 3-Gy irradiation significantly increased the number of peripheral blood neutrophils as compared with those in control mice. Even after discontinuation of G-CSF, both the total leukocyte and neutrophil counts increased to day 10, and their levels remained elevated until day 14. The incidence of myeloid leukemia in mice exposed to a single 3-Gy irradiation was 18.6% (38 of 204), and treatment with G-CSF did not increase the incidence (15.7% [32 of 204]). In the mice with radiation-induced leukemia, those receiving G-CSF had a mean survival time of 357 days, whereas those not receiving the factor survived for 349 days. There was no significant difference of survivals between the two groups. Most of the radiation-induced leukemias in the two groups were M1 or M2, according to the FAB classification; no characteristic difference was observed among the types of leukemias. Although G-CSF stimulated the leukemia cells in vitro, G-CSF administration after irradiation did not increase the occurrence of radiation-induced myeloid leukemias. Our results show that administration of G-CSF effectively accelerates neutrophil recovery from irradiation-induced hematopoietic injury and does not enhance the induction of myeloid leukemia in RFM/MsNrs mice by irradiation.","['Kawase, Y', 'Akashi, M', 'Ohtsu, H', 'Aoki, Y', 'Akanuma, A', 'Suzuki, G']","['Kawase Y', 'Akashi M', 'Ohtsu H', 'Aoki Y', 'Akanuma A', 'Suzuki G']","['Division of Radiation Health, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/blood/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'X-Rays']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82328-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 1;82(7):2163-8.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding suggests that hematopoiesis may depend mainly on soluble factors produced by the stroma. To define these soluble factors, we examine here whether a combination of defined early-acting cytokines can replace soluble stroma-derived biologic activities that induce conservation and differentiation of primitive progenitors. Normal human Lineage-/CD34+/HLA-DR- cells (DR-) were cultured either in the absence of a stromal layer (""stroma-free"") or in a culture system in which DR- cells were separated from the stromal layer by a microporous membrane (""stroma-noncontact""). Both culture systems were supplemented three times per week with or without cytokines. These studies show that culture of DR- cells for 5 weeks in a ""stroma-free"" culture supplemented with a combination of four early acting cytokines (Interleukin-3 [IL-3], stem cell factor [SCF], leukemia-inhibitory factor [LIF], and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) results in a similar cell expansion as when DR- cells are cultured in ""stroma-noncontact"" cultures supplemented with the same cytokines. However, generation of committed progenitors and conservation of the more primitive long-term bone marrow culture initiating cells (LTBMC-IC) was far superior in ""stroma-noncontact"" cultures supplemented with or without IL-3 than in ""stroma-free"" cultures supplemented with IL-3 alone or a combination of IL-3, LIF, G-CSF, and SCF. These studies indicate that human BM stroma produces soluble factors that can either alone or in synergy with defined cytokines (1) conserve primitive LTBMC-IC, (2) induce early differentiation of a fraction of the primitive progenitors, and (3) prevent their terminal differentiation. We show here that these stroma-derived factors are not likely to be the known early acting cytokines IL-3, SCF, LIF, or G-CSF. Characterization of the stroma-derived factor(s) may have important implications for clinically relevant studies, such as in vitro stem cell expansion in cancer treatment and gene therapy.","['Verfaillie, C M']",['Verfaillie CM'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82313-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 1;82(7):2045-53.,"['1-R24-HD30511-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rare cases, leukemoid reactions were attributed to tumor production of unidentified hematopoietic factors. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to show cytokine immunoreactivity in the malignant cells of two cases of IMFH presenting with leukemoid reactions and compared them with two malignant fibrous histocytomas, noninflammatory type. All four tumors stained positively for stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and insulin-like growth factor-I. Other cytokines detected only in the two IMFH included IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IFN-gamma, and keratinocyte growth factor. Granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-3, and transforming growth factor-beta staining was present in one of the two IMFH tumors and was not present in the noninflammatory tumors. The immunohistochemical staining was localized to the malignant cells, suggesting deregulated cytokine expression consistent with their monocytic/histocytic origin. Expression of certain cytokines in the IMFH may account for the local inflammatory infiltrate, tumor fibrosis, and the aggressive nature of the malignant cells. We also detected elevated serum levels of SCF, G-CSF, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor in one or both of the IMFH patients. These latter observations may explain the bone marrow hypercellularity and other paraneoplastic symptoms, including fever, malaise, and weight loss, observed in both patients. Different cytokines present in the two IMFH tumors appear to be responsible for the eosinophilic leukemoid reaction observed in one case and for the granulocytic leukemoid reaction observed in the other patient. They may also be responsible for expansion of the tumor-cell population, fibroblast proliferation, and enhanced secretion of extracellular collagen.","['Melhem, M F', 'Meisler, A I', 'Saito, R', 'Finley, G G', 'Hockman, H R', 'Koski, R A']","['Melhem MF', 'Meisler AI', 'Saito R', 'Finley GG', 'Hockman HR', 'Koski RA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cytokines/*analysis/*blood', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Growth Substances/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/analysis', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous/*blood/diagnosis/*pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Interferon-alpha/analysis', 'Interleukins/*analysis', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/*pathology/surgery', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82312-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 1;82(7):2038-44.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported that the chronic myelogenous leukemia oncogene p210 bcr-abl transforms a growth-factor-dependent myeloid cell line NFS/N1.H7 to interleukin-3 (IL-3) independence. In these p210 bcr-abl-transformed cells (H7 bcr-abl.A54) and in two other murine myeloid cell lines transformed to IL-3 independence by p210 bcr-abl, endogenous p21 RAS is activated as determined by an elevated ratio of associated guanosine triphosphate (GTP)/guanosine diphosphate (GDP), assayed by thin-layer chromatography of the nucleotides eluted from p21 RAS after immunoprecipitation with the Y13-259 antibody. Treatment of p210 bcr-abl-transformed cells with a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A resulted in diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of p210 bcr-abl and associated proteins, without major reduction in expression of the p210 bcr-abl protein itself. Inhibition of p210 bcr-abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation resulted in a reduction of active p21RAS-GTP complexes in the transformed cells, in diminished expression of the nuclear early response genes c-jun and c-fos, and in lower cellular proliferation rate. To further implicate p21 RAS in these functional events downstream of p210 bcr-abl tyrosine phosphorylation, we targeted G-protein function directly by limiting the availability of GTP with the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor, tiazofurin (TR). In p210 bcr-abl-transformed cells treated for 4 hours with TR, in which the levels of GTP were reduced by 50%, but GDP, guanosine monophosphate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were unaffected, p210 bcr-abl tyrosine phosphorylation was at control levels. However, expression of c-fos and c-jun nuclear proto-oncogenes were strongly inhibited and p21 RAS activity was downregulated. These findings show that p210 bcr-abl transduces proliferative signals, in part, through downstream activation of p21 RAS. Furthermore, p21 RAS activity is linked to pathways that regulate c-jun and c-fos expression.","['Mandanas, R A', 'Leibowitz, D S', 'Gharehbaghi, K', 'Tauchi, T', 'Burgess, G S', 'Miyazawa, K', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Boswell, H S']","['Mandanas RA', 'Leibowitz DS', 'Gharehbaghi K', 'Tauchi T', 'Burgess GS', 'Miyazawa K', 'Jayaram HN', 'Boswell HS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Walther Oncology Center, Indianapolis, IN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Probes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, ras', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78360-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1838-47.,['CA-51770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,"['bcr-abl', 'c-fos', 'c-jun', 'ras', 'v-H-ras']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to detect minimal residual disease, we studied two B-lineage antibodies, L26 and MB2, and a T-lineage antibody, UCHL-1, in fixed marrow core biopsies from 34 patients with HCL before and after 2-CdA. Before therapy, hairy cells exhibited intense cytoplasmic membrane reactivity with L26 and strong intracytoplasmic reactivity with MB2. UCHL-1 did not react with hairy cells. Thirty-one patients were assessable 3 months after therapy. Five of 24 (21%) patients in CR by routine evaluation had residual HCL detected by immunostaining. Four of these 5 patients have been reevaluated at 1 year. One patient relapsed by routine evaluation, 2 remained positive by immunostaining alone, and 1 patient became negative by immunostaining. A total of 19 patients have been evaluated at 1 year. Only 1 additional patient has become positive by immunostaining alone. Immunostaining using the B-lineage antibodies highlighted the presence of hairy cells with preservation of morphology. This assisted in quantifying the extent of disease, particularly when hairy cells were interstitial and blended with surrounding hematopoietic tissue, when hairy cells were present in hypocellular marrows, when hairy cells were spindle-shaped, and when marrows were markedly fibrotic. Because immunostaining can be easily performed on routinely processed marrows, it is an attractive method to detect minimal residual disease.

The almost constant position of the chromosome 8 breakpoint (within or immediately 5' of the MYC gene) together with two distinct clusters of breakpoints on chromosome 14 resulted in two main types of MYC/IGH (present in 12 of 15 cases). In the first type (six cases), the MYC gene or at least its coding portion was joined with the JH region on chromosome 14, whereas in the second, present in another six cases, the MYC gene and the C alpha I region were juxtaposed. Physical linkage between the translocated MYC and a known enhancer element of the IGH locus is the common feature in the two types of rearrangement, suggesting that a high-level constitutive expression plays a prominent role in MYC activation.

Immunocytochemical investigation of bone marrow blasts was done using a modified indirect immunoperoxidase technique. This method permitted accurate morphological identification of blasts and other cells in bone marrow. The monoclonal antibodies used in RAEB and RAEB-T samples were anti-CD34, -c-kit, -HLA-DR and -CD13. The range of CD34 expression of blasts in RAEB samples was 1-14% (mean 6.2%) and in RAEB-T samples 29-48% (mean 35.5%). CD34 positivity was detected in 3-94% (mean 47.4%) of the bone marrow blasts in acute myeloid leukaemia evolving from RAEB and RAEB-T.

A high percentage (> 30%) of blasts in most patients with RAEB, RAEB-T and acute myeloid leukaemia was HLA-DR and CD13 positive. We observed the transformation from RAEB to acute myeloid leukaemia in three patients. The proportion of CD34 positive blasts increased to 25% and 32% in two patients. The third patient showed an unchanged percentage of CD34 positivity of blasts.

As a prerequisite to making this discovery, it was necessary to develop protocols to protect chromosomal proteins from dephosphorylation during cell extraction and chromosome isolation procedures. Immunofluorescence analysis of the large chromosomes prepared from Indian Muntjac cells revealed colocalization of MPM-2 and anti-topo II antibodies to the chromosomal centromeres and to the axial regions of the chromosomal arms. For biochemical fractionation studies, large quantities of chromosomes from the P388D1 mouse lymphocyte cell line were isolated and treated to remove DNA and histone proteins. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation experiments with this chromosome scaffold fraction identified the major MPM-2-reactive phosphoprotein to be DNA topo II. Using a panel of anti-peptide antibodies specific to the isoforms of topo II, we determined that the major phosphoprotein recognized by MPM-2 is the 170-kDa isoform of topo II, topo II alpha. The 180-kDa isoform, topo II beta, present in the isolated chromosomes in much smaller quantities, is also recognized by MPM-2.

However, clinical reports on this issue still remain controversial. We evaluated the relationship between CD34 expression, some clinical characteristics and outcome in 80 consecutive adult AML patients. METHODS: Immunophenotyping was performed with a FACSCAN flow cytometer and CD34 was tested by HPCA-1 (My10, Becton-Dickinson). Samples were considered positive when at least 20% of cells were labeled. Promyelocytic leukemias were excluded from the study. Sixty-six patients were designed to receive intensive induction chemotherapy; 14 ""low-dose"" ARA-c. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Forty percent of AML were CD34 positive. In this group there was a higher incidence of less differentiated FAB subtypes (p = 0.03), but not of pre-existing myelodysplasia. No differences were found in complete remission (CR) rate, remission duration or survival. Excluding induction deaths from the analysis, the CR rate was slightly lower in CD34+ AML (55 vs 65%), without any impact on survival. We could not confirm the prognostic relevance of CD34 in adult AML, but larger studies are needed.","['Ciolli, S', 'Leoni, F', 'Caporale, R', 'Pascarella, A', 'Salti, F', 'Rossi-Ferrini, P']","['Ciolli S', 'Leoni F', 'Caporale R', 'Pascarella A', 'Salti F', 'Rossi-Ferrini P']","['Division of Haematology, University of Florence.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1993 May-Jun;78(3):151-5.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)']",,,,,,['Haematologica. 1993 Nov-Dec;78(6):420.

By contrast, little or no expression of c-kit is observed in human leukemia cell lines of lymphoid lineage and in blast cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the c-kit product with the ligand for c-kit (stem cell factor: SCF) results in proliferation of some human leukemia cell lines, such as M07E, and blast cells in a substantial fraction of AML cases. In addition, SCF appears to have an activity in inducing differentiation of certain types of leukemic cells.

We believe that the induction of CD38 antigen is an early event in retinoid-regulated gene expression in normal and transformed myeloid cells.","['Drach, J', 'Zhao, S', 'Malavasi, F', 'Mehta, K']","['Drach J', 'Zhao S', 'Malavasi F', 'Mehta K']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X83720802 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1993.2080 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Sep 15;195(2):545-50. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1993.2080.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies were performed to determine whether these autoantibodies are the products of the neoplastic B-CLL clones. Immunoglobulins (Ig) were eluted from washed red blood cells (RBC) obtained from two CLL patients at the time they had autoimmune (DAT-direct antiglobulin test-positive) hemolytic anemia. The light chain phenotypes of these eluted autoantibodies were determined and found to be monotypic with exact correlation to the light chain expressed on the surface of the B-CLL clones. Elutions from RBC of DAT negative patients or normal volunteers failed to demonstrate measurable amounts of Ig. In contrast, Ig eluted from RBC obtained from SLE patients with DAT positive hemolytic anemia found to be polyclonal autoantibodies exhibiting both light chain types. Furthermore, CD5+B lymphocytes obtained from the same two CLL patients (DAT+) produce, in vitro understimulation with phorbal myristate acetate (PMA), monoclonal antibodies which react and bind to RBC. Thus these studies provide direct evidence demonstrating that the antibodies causing the autoimmune hemolytic anemia in our two CLL patients are the products of the B-CLL neoplastic clones.","['Sthoeger, Z M', 'Sthoeger, D', 'Shtalrid, M', 'Sigler, E', 'Geltner, D', 'Berrebi, A']","['Sthoeger ZM', 'Sthoeger D', 'Shtalrid M', 'Sigler E', 'Geltner D', 'Berrebi A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/blood/*complications/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Autoantibodies/immunology/metabolism', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830430406 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1993 Aug;43(4):259-64. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830430406.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-12 did not support colony formation as a single factor, nor in the presence of IL-11 or SF. In IL-3-containing cultures, IL-12 slightly enhanced neutrophilic and monocyte differentiation.

In the presence of IL-3 + IL-11, IL-12 greatly enhanced neutrophil, megakaryocyte, erythrocyte, and mast cell development.

We therefore hypothesized that CLL cells aberrantly express one or more receptors involved in lymphocyte trafficking. Leukemia cells from patients with B-cell CLL showed no quantitative difference in surface expression of L-selectin, LFA-1, or CD44 by flow cytometry compared to normal B cells. Analysis of L-selectin by dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot, however, demonstrated a consistent, reproducible approximately 3.7 kDa decrease in the M(r) of L-selectin on CLL cells compared to normal B cells. In contrast, Western blot analysis revealed no obvious qualitative abnormality in either CD11a (the alpha-chain of LFA-1) or CD44 on CLL cells. Analysis of L-selectin cDNA by polymerase chain reaction revealed identically sized products for both normal and CLL cells, suggesting that the abnormality in M(r) does not result from a difference in primary structure. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in the production of identical-sized nascent L-selectin by normal and CLL cells. These studies demonstrate that L-selectin on CLL cells is aberrantly glycosylated compared to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. The functional importance of this aberrant glycosylation is unclear, however, since L-selectin is shed normally from phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated CLL cells and since normal and CLL lymphocytes bind equally well in vitro to high endothelial venules.

G-CSF binding was observed in blasts from 3 My+ ALL patients and one My- ALL child. After culture, blasts from My- ALL children expressed CD13 but showed neither enhanced DNA synthesis with G-CSF nor G-CSF binding.

Considering recent evidence that mast cell growth factor (MGF) enhances the proliferative capacity of normal erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), we examined whether MGF could increase the proliferative potential of CML erythroid progenitors to normal capacity. To evaluate the total proliferative capacity achieved, the BFU-E were divided into four subpopulations (XL = extra large, L = large, M = medium, S = small) and colonies were aspirated to determine the cellularity of BFU-E from each subpopulation. MGF alone or in combination with MoT cell line conditioned medium (MoCM) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) + interleukin-3 (IL-3) significantly increased the proliferative capacity of erythropoietin (EPO) dependent CML and normal BFU-E. Although the total number of BFU-E generated were similar, the number of BFU-E with high proliferative potential were considerably less in CML BFU-E populations. BFU-E designated XL (129,000-431,000 cells) were only found in MGF cultures and only normal BFU-E had this proliferative capacity. BFU-E designated L were increased in both normal and CML BFU-E populations but less CML BFU-E had this proliferative capacity (mean number 25% of normal) and CML L BFU-E from 2/3 CML patients comprised fewer cells than normal L BFU-E. Normal BFU-E populations comprised 16-24% high proliferative BFU-E (XL + L) in contrast to 4-5% high proliferative BFU-E (L only) comprising CML BFU-E populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Strife, A', 'Perez, A', 'Lambek, C', 'Wisniewski, D', 'Bruno, S', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Clarkson, B']","['Strife A', 'Perez A', 'Lambek C', 'Wisniewski D', 'Bruno S', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Clarkson B']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Cell Kinetics, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90115-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90115-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Sep;17(9):799-807. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90115-2.,"['CA20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The different chondroitin sulfates were evaluated for purity, structure and physicochemical properties. The three chondroitin sulfates utilized did not present other contaminant glycosaminoglycans and proteins and had about the same relative molecular mass but different disaccharide patterns and charge density. Chondroitin sulfates with small amounts of disulfated disaccharides and low charge density, at 5 micrograms/ml concentration, doubled (about + 133%) cell proliferation in comparison to controls. In contrast, chondroitin sulfates with large amounts of disulfated disaccharides and high sulfate to carboxyl ratio were less effective (about + 15%) in stimulating cell proliferation at low concentration. A decrease of U-937 cell proliferation was observed in proportion to the increased amounts of chondroitin sulfate with low sulfate to carboxyl ratio. On the contrary, chondroitin sulfate with large amounts of disulfated disaccharides produced increased cell proliferation depending on concentration. Small amounts (5-10 micrograms/ml) of chondroitin sulfates with low charge density reduced the differentiative process of U-937 cells. Chondroitin sulfate with large amounts of disulfated disaccharides and high charge density seemed to be able to produce a significant decrease of differentiative processes only at very high concentrations (1000 micrograms/ml). These contrasting effects of chondroitin sulfates with different disaccharide patterns (and structure) and charge density on a leukemia cell line could help to explain the regulation of proliferative and/or differentiative processes of hemopoietic cells. This is underlined by the changes of types, physicochemical properties and structure of glycosaminoglycans induced by different extracellular factors and agents.","['Volpi, N', 'Bolognani, L', 'Conte, A', 'Petrini, M']","['Volpi N', 'Bolognani L', 'Conte A', 'Petrini M']","['Department of Biologia Animale, University of Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90114-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90114-z [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Sep;17(9):789-98. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90114-z.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-selectin is present in distinct forms on both neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes, and it appears to play an important role in the early stages of leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction. Activation of leukocytes leads to shedding of the extracellular part of L-selectin which thus forms a soluble adhesion molecule, sL-selectin, which retains functional capacity and can be detected in serum. In the present study we have developed a specific, sensitive sandwich ELISA to measure the serum level of sL-selectin in patients with hematological and infectious disorders. Three patients with acute myeloid leukemia in remission and 1 patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were followed during bone marrow transplantation and the level of sL-selectin was found to correlate closely to the leukocyte counts with no detectable sL-selectin during periods of severe leukopenia. In 11 patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia and 13 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia the sL-selectin level was also found to correlate closely to the leukocyte count (R = 0.98; p = 0.001 and R = 0.83; p = 0.004 respectively). One CML patient with a leukocytosis of 385 x 10(9)/l was found to have an sL-selectin concentration 625 times above normal. Ten patients with acute pneumonia were evaluated at diagnosis and at the time of follow-up 4-8 weeks later. In all patients the initial sL-selectin level was higher than at follow-up. However, no close correlation between sL-selectin and leukocyte count or CRP (C-reactive protein) at the time of diagnosis was found. In summary, we have found that the sL-selectin level in human serum closely correlates to the leukocyte count in both CML and CLL and during bone marrow transplantation.","['Zetterberg, E', 'Richter, J']","['Zetterberg E', 'Richter J']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/surgery', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Pneumonia/blood']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb01603.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1993 Aug;51(2):113-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb01603.x.,,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since PA- and HYD-induced autoantibodies are directed primarily against histones and histones are prime acceptors of poly (ADP-ribose) (PADPR), we have investigated the effects of PA and HYD on the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PADPRP). Control substances, with structures similar to PA and HYD but not known to induce lupus, included N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) and the amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan and proline, and their amide derivatives. Wil-2 cells were incubated in 0.5-50 microM PA, NAPA and HYD, which included therapeutic concentrations of these drugs. The mean enhancement of incorporation of [3H]-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) into PADPR was 1.84 (P = 0.005) with PA, with HYD 1.48 (P = 0.029), and with NAPA 1.38 (P = 0.036). This increase was suppressed by 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of PADPRP activity. Little or no increase in [3H]-NAD incorporation was observed with equivalent concentrations of phenylalanine, phenylalaninamide or tryptophan. However, a 1.29-fold increase was noted with 0.5 microM tryptophanamide, a 1.26-fold increase with 0.5 microM prolinamide and a 1.4-fold increase with 50 microM proline. PA increased PADPRP activity in B- and T-cell lines but not in promyelocytic leukemia or epithelial cell lines. Since poly (ADP-ribosylation) is important in the cellular response to various agents, the increased ADP-ribosylation of intracellular molecules may be a key event in the induction of autoantibodies.","['Ayer, L M', 'Edworthy, S M', 'Fritzler, M J']","['Ayer LM', 'Edworthy SM', 'Fritzler MJ']","['Joint Injury and Arthritis Research Group, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lupus,Lupus,9204265,IM,"['Acecainide/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Humans', 'Hydralazine/*pharmacology', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Procainamide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/096120339300200307 [doi]'],ppublish,Lupus. 1993 Jun;2(3):167-72. doi: 10.1177/096120339300200307.,,"['26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '26NAK24LS8 (Hydralazine)', '910Q707V6F (Acecainide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'L39WTC366D (Procainamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work has examined the effects of 1-(beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine (ara-C), an antileukemia agent that misincorporates into DNA, on EGR-1 expression. Treatment of HL-525 myeloid leukemia cells with ara-C was associated with transient increases in EGR-1 mRNA levels. Nuclear run-on assays showed that this effect is related at least in part to activation of EGR-1 gene transcription. Sequences responsive to ara-C-induced signals were determined by deletion analysis of the EGR-1 promoter. The results demonstrate that ara-C inducibility of the EGR-1 gene is conferred by a region containing six serum response or CC(A/T)6GG (CArG) motifs. Further analysis demonstrated that the first two distal or 5'-most CArG elements are functional in the ara-C response. An oligomer corresponding to the first CArG element also conferred ara-C inducibility of the minimal thymdine kinase gene promoter, while no inducibility was detectable using a similar oligomer containing a mutated CArG box. Other work has demonstrated that the nuclear serum response factor (SRF) interacts with the CArG box in the EGR-1 promoter and that the serine/threonine pp90rsk protein kinase phosphorylates SRF in vitro at sites phosphorylated in vivo. The present studies demonstrate that ara-C has little if any effect on cytosolic pp90rsk as determined by immunoblotting to assess electrophoretic mobility and by immune-complex kinase assays using S6 peptide as substrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kharbanda, S', 'Saleem, A', 'Rubin, E', 'Sukhatme, V', 'Blenis, J', 'Kufe, D']","['Kharbanda S', 'Saleem A', 'Rubin E', 'Sukhatme V', 'Blenis J', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Ribosomal Protein S6', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases', 'Ribosomal Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/07 00:00,1993/09/07 00:01,['1993/09/07 00:00'],"['1993/09/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/07 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00086a019 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Sep 7;32(35):9137-42. doi: 10.1021/bi00086a019.,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Protein S6)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein forms multiple complexes with cellular enzymes such as tyrosine kinases (pp60c-src), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phosphatase 2A. Association with MTAg leads to the activation of pp60c-src through interference with phosphorylation at Tyr-527, a site negatively regulating src kinase activity. MTAg abrogates mitosis-specific activation of pp60c-src, resulting in constitutive high kinase activity of the enzyme throughout all phases of the cell cycle. Here we report that MTAg is transiently modified during mitosis, resulting in an increase in its apparent molecular size on SDS/acrylamide gels. Similarly, MTAg isolated from interphase cells and phosphorylated by the cell cycle-regulated serine/threonine kinase p34cdc2 in vitro has increased molecular mass. The large molecular mass form of the protein can be converted to the authentic 56-kDa form upon dephosphorylation by potato acid phosphatase. Two putative phosphorylation sites for a cdc2-like kinase were identified as Thr-160 and -291, respectively. Conversion of Thr-160 to Ala resulted in a transformation-defective mutant protein that was still capable of associating with pp60c-src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phosphatase 2A, while the corresponding mutant in position 291 was wild type with respect to all parameters measured so far. These data suggest that phosphorylation by p34cdc2 or a related cell cycle-regulated kinase modulates the interaction of MTAg with cellular targets that are crucial for cell transformation.","['Perez, L', 'Paasinen, A', 'Schnierle, B', 'Kach, S', 'Senften, M', 'Ballmer-Hofer, K']","['Perez L', 'Paasinen A', 'Schnierle B', 'Kach S', 'Senften M', 'Ballmer-Hofer K']","['Friedrich Miescher-Institute, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Mice', '*Mitosis', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Polyomavirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.17.8113 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 1;90(17):8113-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.17.8113.,,"['EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",,,,,PMC47298,,,,,,,,,,

In view of cellular immunotherapy with cytotoxic monocytes in minimal residual disease of acute myeloid leukemia we have studied the role of monocytes in cell cycle dependent leukemic cell death of U937, THP-1, and HL-60 cells in vitro. Leukemic cells separated in G1 of the cell cycle by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation were highly susceptible to monocyte mediated cytotoxicity, whereas cells in S and G2-M were less sensitive or completely resistant as compared to unfractionated control cells. HL-60 cells resistant to cytotoxic monocytes became sensitive to monocyte mediated cytotoxicity upon differentiation induction with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 which paralleled an accumulation of cells in G1 of the cell cycle. The differences in susceptibility of cell phase separated populations to monocyte mediated cytotoxicity paralleled differences in sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha, as secreted by gamma-interferon activated monocytes. Furthermore, monocyte mediated cytotoxicity was markedly inhibited in the presence of anti-CD11/CD18 monoclonal antibodies recognizing the alpha and beta chains of the beta 2-integrin adhesion proteins. By fluorescence activated cell sorter immunofluorescence a marked increase in mean fluorescence density of the beta 2-integrins could be demonstrated on cells in G1 of the cell cycle as compared to unseparated leukemic cells. A decrease in mean fluorescence density was shown for cells in G2-M. By blocking experiments with anti-CD11/CD18 monoclonal antibodies, the differences in mean fluorescence density were functionally relevant since cells in G1 were shown to be the most sensitive cells to beta 2-integrin dependent monocyte mediated cytotoxicity. In conclusion these data show that differences in sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor and in the expression of beta 2-integrins may play a central role in cell cycle dependent monocyte mediated antileukemic activity.","['van de Loosdrecht, A A', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Beelen, R H', 'Broekhoven, M G', 'Langenhuijsen, M M']","['van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Beelen RH', 'Broekhoven MG', 'Langenhuijsen MM']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'CD11 Antigens', 'CD18 Antigens', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Integrins/analysis/*physiology', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/09/15 00:00,2000/03/15 09:00,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Sep 15;53(18):4399-407.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the activation of human T-cells in vitro with bispecific monoclonal antibodies, which were generated by hybridoma-hybridoma fusion. Preactivated allogeneic and autologous T-cells could be triggered to lyse tumoral B-cells in the presence of CD3 x CD19 bispecific antibodies. In addition, the combined use of two CD3 x CD19 plus CD28 x CD22 bispecific antibodies induced optimal interleukin 2 secretion by Jurkat T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cells in the presence of target B-cells. The same antibody combination was able to generate cytolytic effector cells without prior activation, when resting T-cells were cocultured with freshly isolated autologous leukemic B-cells in the presence of the bispecific antibodies. The results suggest that signals required to activate cytolytic T-cell precursors can be provided by the two bispecific antibodies. Although activation of resting T-cells can be achieved by CD3 x CD19 bispecific antibodies in association with monospecific bivalent CD28 antibodies, the second bispecific antibody, CD28 x CD22, further increases the specificity of the target cell dependent activation of T-cells. When used for immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies, the CD3 x CD19 and CD28 x CD22 bispecific antibody combination may avoid the need for ex vivo activated effector cells, because the antibodies may induce T-cell activation directly at the tumor site.","['Bohlen, H', 'Manzke, O', 'Patel, B', 'Moldenhauer, G', 'Dorken, B', 'von Fliedner, V', 'Diehl, V', 'Tesch, H']","['Bohlen H', 'Manzke O', 'Patel B', 'Moldenhauer G', 'Dorken B', 'von Fliedner V', 'Diehl V', 'Tesch H']","['Universitat zu Koln, Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'CD28 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Sep 15;53(18):4310-4.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cd22 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell adhesion assays, which were performed in nine patients, showed marked adhesion of ATL cells to interleukin [IL]-1-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). A monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against E-selectin consistently inhibited ATL cell adhesion, and an MoAb against vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) or an MoAb against VLA-4 sometimes diminished it. In contrast, an MoAb against LFA-1 had a minor effect on freshly isolated ATL cell adhesion to HUVEC. The percentage of SLex+ cells in the cell population adherent to IL-1-activated HUVEC was slightly higher than that in unseparated cells. These results, together with the detection of E-selectin expression on the endothelium at ATL skin lesions, indicate that E-selectin-mediated adhesion is the major pathway for the adherence of ATL cells to endothelial cells.

Synthetic unmodified antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were derived from different regions of the c-mpl extracellular domain. On in vitro exposure of CD34+ cells, two antisense oligomers led to a 50% to 70% inhibition of c-mpl mRNA synthesis, whereas their respective sense had no effect.

To investigate the possibility of the clinical application of these cytokines by combination with cell cycle-specific anti-tumor reagents, we assessed the effects of SLF and GM-CSF on the modulation of the cell cycle and sensitivity against cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) in a human factor-dependent leukemic cell line, MO7e. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the effect of cell recruitment into the cell cycle in the quiescent MO7e cells by exposure to these cytokines. The drug-sensitivity test using the MTT assay system demonstrated that pre-treatment with each cytokine enhanced sensitivity of ara-C. Furthermore, by combination of SLF and GM-CSF, the ara-C sensitivity was significantly wore graty enhanced than by each cytokine alone.

Viral RNA present in serum is bound to silica particles in the presence of a high concentration of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) which denatures any proteins present, specifically ribonucleases. After washing the RNA/silica pellet, the RNA is eluted in water and reverse transcribed using random primers and Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of a modified PCR buffer. The resultant cDNA is amplified using nested PCR and the products of amplification are detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The identity of bands on the gel is confirmed using a digoxigenin-labelled oligomer probe.

Of 7 controlled prophylactic studies performed with quinolones, 2 were double-blind and placebo-controlled. The occurrence of fever and mortality due to infection was not reduced with quinolone prophylaxis, although the occurrence of Gram-negative bacteraemia was significantly reduced. The delay to first fever was occasionally increased, and this was associated with a reduction in the number of days with antimicrobial agents. No effect was observed on disseminated fungal infections with quinolone prophylaxis. Breakthrough bacteraemia and subsequent infections were due to resistant organisms, mainly Gram-positive organisms (streptococci, staphylococci). Tolerability and compliance were excellent and were occasionally better than with the classic regimen [nonabsorbable antibiotics and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole)]. Six controlled studies dealing with empiric treatment with the quinolones were reviewed. Overall, the results suggested that monotherapy with ciprofloxacin may be used in patients with a good prognosis (short and less severe neutropenia, solid tumours, compliant patients). Combinations with broad spectrum penicillins, netilmicin or teicoplanin seem to be as effective as the classic regimens (a broad spectrum penicillin or cephalosporin plus aminoglycosides), although the number of patients was limited (n = 334).

A role in very early development is suggested by the requirement for DIA/LIF to support the self-renewal of cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells. Other data point to potential roles in the establishment and maintenance of primordial germ cells, in osteogenesis and in haematopoiesis, and possibly in neuronal specification. DIA/LIF may also act as a mediator of the hepatic acute phase response. In the present study the expression of DIA/LIF transcripts during murine development and in adult mice has been determined using a highly sensitive ribonuclease protection analysis. In contrast to previous reports, it is apparent that DIA/LIF transcripts are present at low levels in many adult mouse tissues. Higher levels of expression are observed in skin, lung, intestine, and uterus. Elevated amounts of mRNA are also found in certain foetal tissue during late gestation and neonatally. In earlier embryogenesis, however, DIA/LIF mRNA is produced primarily in extraembryonic tissues. The alternative transcripts which produce either soluble or matrix-associated DIA/LIF exhibit overlapping but non-identical patterns of expression, consistent with the proposition that the two isoforms may have distinct biological functions. These findings are suggestive of widespread roles for DIA/LIF in vivo and are discussed in the light of available data on the phenotype of homozygous DIA/LIF-deficient mice.","['Robertson, M', 'Chambers, I', 'Rathjen, P', 'Nichols, J', 'Smith, A']","['Robertson M', 'Chambers I', 'Rathjen P', 'Nichols J', 'Smith A']","['AFRC Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, Scotland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dev Genet,Developmental genetics,7909963,IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antisense Elements (Genetics)', '*Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvg.1020140303 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Genet. 1993;14(3):165-73. doi: 10.1002/dvg.1020140303.,,"['0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, a specific ligand of the ABS induces effects equivalent to those of tamoxifen, suggesting that tamoxifen inhibits Moloney murine leukemia virus replication through an estrogen-independent pathway involving the ABS.","['Chailleux, C', 'Mesange, F', 'Bayard, F', 'Prats, A C', 'Faye, J C']","['Chailleux C', 'Mesange F', 'Bayard F', 'Prats AC', 'Faye JC']","[""Institut Louis Bugnard, Contrat Jeune Formation INSERM 9103, Laboratoire d'Endocrinologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Rangueil, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Estrogen Antagonists/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Phenyl Ethers/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1993 Aug;44(2):324-7.,,"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Phenyl Ethers)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '147664-41-3 (pyrrolidino-benzylphenoxyethanamine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the major features of apoptosis is the activation of an endogenous nuclease that cleaves DNA into nucleosomal fragments. Little is known about the activation or specificity of the apoptotic endonuclease. In this study, we investigated signalling pathways and the specificity of the apoptotic nuclease. We found that forced over-expression of activated H-ras inhibited activation of the apoptotic endonuclease. Since a high percentage of myelodysplasias and leukemias have mutations that activate ras, this finding lends insight into how ras might be leukemogenic. In addition, the phorbol ester TPA and a cyclic AMP analogue also slowed activation of this endonuclease. Interestingly, protein synthesis inhibition stimulated the endonuclease activity. In addition, by cloning and sequencing apoptotic fragments we found that the apoptotic nuclease has no sequence specificity. Thus, the apoptotic nuclease inhibited by H-ras over-expression was random in nature.","['Moore, J', 'Boswell, S', 'Hoffman, R', 'Burgess, G', 'Hromas, R']","['Moore J', 'Boswell S', 'Hoffman R', 'Burgess G', 'Hromas R']","['Department of Medicine, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis 46252-5121.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Base Composition', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, ras', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', '*Point Mutation', 'Poly A/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90078-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90078-y [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Aug;17(8):703-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90078-y.,"['HL 48914/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL46548/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)']",,,"['H-ras', 'ras']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical features of FA include pancytopenia, often accompanied by specific congenital malformations, and a predisposition to leukemia. Since the hematological manifestations are the critical defect in terms of prognosis, FA is a candidate disease for gene replacement therapy, and the development of a mouse model system is essential for the initial stages of this work. Previously, we have cloned the gene defective in FA group C by complementation of the intrinsic sensitivity of FA cells to DNA cross-linking agents. We have now cloned the murine homologue of the human FACC cDNA. The mouse cDNA (Facc) shares 79% amino acid sequence similarity with the human gene product. The expression of the mouse cDNA in human FA(C) cells restores the cellular drug sensitivity to normal levels. Thus, the function of the protein has been conserved despite the significant sequence divergence. PCR analysis of mouse tissue RNA reveals that the gene is expressed in all adult tissues, while in situ RNA hybridization experiments show tissue specific expression at late stages of fetal development. Cross-hybridizing sequences exist in DNA from other mammals, chicken and Drosophila. These results support the hypothesis that the FACC gene product has a role in a basic aspect of cellular protection against DNA damaging agents and that this function has been conserved during evolution.","['Wevrick, R', 'Clarke, C A', 'Buchwald, M']","['Wevrick R', 'Clarke CA', 'Buchwald M']","['Department of Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'DNA/*genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drosophila/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Mammals/genetics', 'Mice/embryology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/2.6.655 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 1993 Jun;2(6):655-62. doi: 10.1093/hmg/2.6.655.,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fancc protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,['GENBANK/L80266'],"['ERCC3', 'FACC', 'facc', 'mus308']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied peripheral blood (PB) from 161 cases of HCL using two-color direct immunofluorescence flow cytometry and an extended panel of antibody combinations. Circulating hairy cells were identified by immunophenotypic features in 92% of the cases and could be detected even when representing < or = 1% of circulating lymphocytes. The 133 cases with > or = 2% detectable hairy cells were analyzed in detail. HCL showed a uniform and unique B-cell phenotype, with each of the following features identified in 99% to 100% of cases: (1) positive staining for B-ly7, coexpressed with CD19; (2) very intense, uniform expression of CD11c, with CD19; (3) moderately intense staining for CD25, with CD19; (4) very intense staining for CD22; (5) moderate to very intense staining for CD20; and (6) moderately intense monoclonal surface Ig. Phenotypic variability existed in expression of CD10 (26%) and CD5 (4%). Based on these features, HCL was easily distinguished from 50 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although CLL exhibited frequent expression of CD11c (74%) and CD25 (68%), the intensity of staining was significantly less than HCL. Furthermore, CLL was uniformly positive for CD5 and showed weak staining for CD20, CD22, and surface Ig. B-ly7 proved to be the most specific marker, reacting with 100% of HCL cases, but absent in all cases of CLL. We conclude that two-color flow cytometry with specific antibody combinations is an efficacious method for characterization and sensitive detection of hairy cells in PB. Application of the phenotypic criteria described should help to increase accuracy in diagnosis of HCL.","['Robbins, B A', 'Ellison, D J', 'Spinosa, J C', 'Carey, C A', 'Lukes, R J', 'Poppema, S', 'Saven, A', 'Piro, L D']","['Robbins BA', 'Ellison DJ', 'Spinosa JC', 'Carey CA', 'Lukes RJ', 'Poppema S', 'Saven A', 'Piro LD']","['Department of Pathology, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD11 Antigens', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84088-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1277-87.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isoforms of c-kit have been characterized in the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line M-07. Deletion of the four amino acids Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys in the extracellular domain represents an alternatively spliced isoform that has been shown by others, in mice, to be associated with constitutive receptor autophosphorylation (Reith et al, EMBO J 10:2451, 1991). Additional isoforms differ in the inclusion or exclusion of a serine residue in the interkinase domain, a region that contains the binding site for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. By RNase protection analysis, we have shown coexpression of the Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys+ and Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys- isoforms, with dominance of the Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys- transcript, in normal human bone marrow, normal melanocytes, a range of tumor cell lines, and the blasts of 23 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Analysis of transcripts for the Ser+ and Ser- isoforms also showed coexpression in all normal and leukemic cells examined. The ratios of isoform expression for both the Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys and Ser variants were relatively constant, providing no evidence in the tumors examined that upregulation of one isoform contributes to the neoplastic process.","['Crosier, P S', 'Ricciardi, S T', 'Hall, L R', 'Vitas, M R', 'Clark, S C', 'Crosier, K E']","['Crosier PS', 'Ricciardi ST', 'Hall LR', 'Vitas MR', 'Clark SC', 'Crosier KE']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis/physiology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84072-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1151-8.,,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The similarities in response suggest MELC may be a useful model for determining mechanisms of action of DNA-active developmental toxicants. As such, we used the MELC model to investigate the mechanism of action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite that induced in GD 14 rat fetuses an apparent S-phase accumulation in limb cells 8 hr after in utero exposure, but S-phase depletion in liver cells 24 hr postexposure. MELC timed-recovery and synchronization studies suggest that in proliferative tissues, 5-FU induces an early S-phase accumulation, followed by a synchronous, concentration-dependent delay in progression through the cell cycle. Consequently, it is the tissue-specific rate of delay, rather than different mechanisms of action, that results in apparent tissue-specific perturbations. Moreover, growth and cell-cycle data suggest that cells entering S phase (when TS activity is greatest) are the most sensitive to 5-FU toxicity. Assays of the TS activity of recovering MELC reveal that although the initial extent of TS inhibition does not appear to be concentration-dependent, the time to recovery is, suggesting that the rate of S-phase progression is closely associated with TS activity. Together, the induction of similar cell-cycle perturbations in embryonic/fetal tissues and MELC following exposure to CP (or CP metabolites), D-AZA, or 5-FU, as well as the adaptability of MELC to a variety of kinetic assays suggests that, for those developmental toxicants suspected of inducing cell-cycle perturbations in embryonic/fetal tissues, MELC may prove useful for elucidating mechanisms of action.","['Elstein, K H', 'Zucker, R M', 'Shuey, D L', 'Lau, C', 'Chernoff, N', 'Rogers, J M']","['Elstein KH', 'Zucker RM', 'Shuey DL', 'Lau C', 'Chernoff N', 'Rogers JM']","['ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Teratology,Teratology,0153257,IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cyclophosphamide/toxicity', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Fetus/drug effects', 'Fluorouracil/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Teratogens/*toxicity', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Toxicology/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tera.1420480112 [doi]'],ppublish,Teratology. 1993 Jul;48(1):75-87. doi: 10.1002/tera.1420480112.,,"['0 (Teratogens)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present preliminary observations on the use of filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) for relapse after transplantation. METHODS: Seven female patients with leukemia (one with chronic myelogenous leukemia, five with acute myelogenous leukemia, and one with a myelodysplastic syndrome that transformed into acute myelogenous leukemia) whose disease relapsed within 360 days after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation received filgrastim (5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day by subcutaneous injection) to reinduce remission by stimulating residual donor marrow cells. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and determination of restriction-fragment--length polymorphisms were used to assess response and chimerism. RESULTS: Three of the seven patients had a complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission, with reestablishment of hematopoiesis of donor origin. Mild chronic graft-versus-host disease developed in one patient, and acute graft-versus-host disease in none. One patient had a relapse 12 months after treatment, and two others remained in remission after 10 and 11 months. In two of the patients with a response, fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated stimulation of donor cells without differentiation of the leukemic clone.

AML colony-forming cells (AML-CFU) were then determined in semi-solid culture in the presence of the same growth factor. The results showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of Ara-C to AML-CFU following stimulation by G-CSF (p < 0.002 at 0.01 microM, p < 0.002 at 0.1 microM, and p < 0.01 at 1 microM Ara-C), IL-3 (p < 0.002 at 0.01 microM, p = 0.001 at 0.1 microM, p < 0.01 at 1 microM, Ara-C), and GM-CSF (p = 0.01 at 0.01 microM, p < 0.01 at 0.1 microM, and p < 0.002 at 1 microM Ara-C).

However, the effect of HGF stimulation as studied by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation during the first or second 24 hours of HGF stimulation did not explain the difference between poor and good HGF enhanced Ara-C cytotoxicity, indicating that other cellular changes than cell-cycle activation as the consequence of growth factor stimulation are responsible for enhanced cytotoxicity.

The reported incidence of TdT+ AML cases varies largely (from 0% to 55%, average of combined data of the literature 18%, children 19%, and adults 21%) suggesting interlaboratory differences in the types of AML examined, the sensitivity of the method used, and the percentage of positive blasts taken as cut-off value. Significantly higher frequencies of TdT+ AML were reported in studies employing immunocytochemical staining (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase or immunoperoxidase) than in series using immunofluorescence microscopy or biochemical assays. Statistical analysis of various cut-off levels demonstrates an inverse correlation between cut-off point and incidence. The combined data show that TdT-positivity is more common in the immature cell types (M0, M1), with no correlation with age or sex.

Although an association between T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and expression of TdT in AML was postulated, subsequent studies could not demonstrate this correlation. There was no significant relationship with other immunophenotypic markers except for CD34 positivity suggesting that the TdT+ cells represent an immature population. The percentage of positive cells was usually lower in AML than in ALL; in most cases only a subpopulation of the AML cells was TdT+. Thus, TdT could be viewed as a marker of hematopoietic immaturity. In about one-half of the studies on adults, TdT expression was reported to indicate a poor prognosis; others did not find any prognostic difference between TdT+ and TdT- AML cases. No correlation between TdT-positivity and prognosis was found in childhood AML.","['Drexler, H G', 'Sperling, C', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Drexler HG', 'Sperling C', 'Ludwig WD']","['German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1142-50.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in these settings. In cytotoxic drug plus G-CSF mobilization of PBSC, granulocyte/macrophage and erythroid progenitor cells were significantly increased in PBSC harvests compared to cytotoxic drug-induced mobilization. When G-CSF was administered prior to the marrow-ablative conditioning before ABSCT, clinical results suggest that chemosensitivity of leukemic cells may be increased. When G-CSF was given after ABSCT, hematologic recovery from marrow aplasia was enhanced substantially.

However, unlike gamma/delta+ T lymphocytes, NK cells do not express CD3/T cell receptor (TCR) molecules, and the receptors involved in cell-mediated cytotoxicity are unknown. To further delineate circulating NK cells, we developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the human NK leukemia YT2C2. We report the isolation of a mAb termed BY55, recognizing at the cell surface a novel 80-kD protein with restricted expression. In addition to the immunizing cell line, this mAb binds to circulating NK cells, gamma/delta+ cells, and a minor subset of alpha/beta+ T lymphocytes. Expression of the BY55 mAb-reactive epitope/molecule is regulated by activation, as short-term culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with phorbol ester induced its downmodulation. Furthermore, BY55 mAb reactivity was found neither with the NK nor with the TCR alpha/beta+ gamma/delta+ clones tested. Biochemical studies as well as phenotypic analysis revealed that this structure is different from all previously identified molecules on the lymphocyte cell surface. Interestingly, we found that BY55+ cells exert most NK activity obtained with fresh circulating lymphocytes. We report that within fresh E rosette-positive PBL only a subset of the CD16+, CD56+, and CD57+ cells coexpressed BY55 molecule, indicating that BY55 mAb defines a unique subset mediating NK activity of circulating PBL.","['Maiza, H', 'Leca, G', 'Mansur, I G', 'Schiavon, V', 'Boumsell, L', 'Bensussan, A']","['Maiza H', 'Leca G', 'Mansur IG', 'Schiavon V', 'Boumsell L', 'Bensussan A']","['Laboratoire INSERM U93, Association Claude Bernard, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/chemistry', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.178.3.1121 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Sep 1;178(3):1121-6. doi: 10.1084/jem.178.3.1121.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,PMC2191151,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence that this pathway is important in Kaposi cell growth.,848-57,"Oncostatin-M (OSM) is a potent mitogen for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) cells. We studied signaling by the OSM receptor in three AIDS-related KS lines and show induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of 145-, 120-, 85-, and 42-kD substrates. The 42-kD substrate was identified as p42MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), also known as ERK-2. This serine/threonine kinase relays mitogenic signals from receptor tyrosine protein kinases (TPKs) or receptor-associated TPKs to transcriptional activators. The OSM dose dependence for MAP kinase activation and induction of KS cell growth were almost identical, suggesting functional linkage. MAP kinase activation was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, and both OSM-induced MAP kinase activity and KS cell growth could be suppressed by TPK inhibitors, genistein and geldanomycin. OSM also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of similar substrates and MAP kinase activity in human vein endothelial cells. While it has been proposed that the OSM receptor may include the gp130 subunit of the IL-6 receptor and alpha-chain of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, neither LIF nor r.IL-6 induced tyrosine protein phosphorylation or p42MAPK activation in KS cells. However, r.IL-6 did stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and p42MAPK activity in the human B cell line, AF-10, while OSM and LIF exerted no effects. Our results indicate that, although the OSM and IL-6 receptors share a common signaling pathway, this pathway is selectively activated by OSM in Kaposi's cells.","['Amaral, M C', 'Miles, S', 'Kumar, G', 'Nel, A E']","['Amaral MC', 'Miles S', 'Kumar G', 'Nel AE']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1680.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Benzoquinones', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116659 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 Aug;92(2):848-57. doi: 10.1172/JCI116659.,"['AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-41576/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-48496/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",,,,,PMC294923,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence of leukemias with a megakaryocytic component may be underestimated when conventional techniques are utilized. The recent development of immuno-ultrastructural procedures for simultaneous detection of platelet peroxidase reaction and specific platelet membrane antigens has increased our capability of recognizing blast cells of the megakaryocytic lineage. METHODS: In this study the occurrence and distribution of megakaryoblastic in the FAB subtypes of adult ""de novo"" acute myeloid leukemias was employed to detect megakaryocytic precursors. RESULTS: A megakaryoblastic proliferation was demonstrated in 8/42 cases (19%), with a much higher percentage than previously reported and an unusual distribution in the M2 subtype.

By analysis of [35S]methionine-labelled cells we found that synthesis of p60src is higher in human monocytes compared to macrophages derived from in vitro cultivation of monocytes. Western blot analysis showed that expression of p60src in monocyte-derived macrophages can be enhanced if monocytes are differentiated into macrophages in the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Enhanced p60src expression caused by IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha correlated with an enhanced autophosphorylating kinase activity assayed in anti-p60src immune precipitates. In vivo phosphorylation of p60src and analysis of phosphopeptides by tryptic digestion showed that treatment with cytokines did not affect the pattern of phosphorylation of distinct phosphopeptides. The human monocytic cell lines, U937 and HL-60, induced to differentiate along the monocytic pathway by IFN-gamma, or a combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, expressed higher amounts of the p60src, but not of the p59fyn or p62yes, kinase activity. These findings show that p60src is modulated in the course of differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages, and that macrophage-activating cytokines increase p60src expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages.","['Sorio, C', 'Melotti, P', 'Dusi, S', 'Berton, G']","['Sorio C', 'Melotti P', 'Dusi S', 'Berton G']","['Institute of General Pathology, University of Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/08/02 00:00,1993/08/02 00:01,['1993/08/02 00:00'],"['1993/08/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/02 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(93)81012-O [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(93)81012-o [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1993 Aug 2;327(3):315-20. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(93)81012-o.,,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have cloned and sequenced the breakpoint junctions from a patient who had null-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a t(11;14)(q23;q11). The chromosome 14 breakpoints occurred within the TCRD locus, close to two diversity segments. The chromosome 11 breakpoint occurred between two head-to-head heptamer sequences, and junctional diversity was evident at both derivative junctions, suggesting involvement of the V(D)J recombinase. The TCRA/D locus on the normal chromosome 14 had undergone a V delta 2-D delta 3-psi J alpha joining. Two phage clones with this VDJ rearrangement were isolated; one of these contained an intra-J alpha region deletion. Two clones with the derivative 11 junction were isolated; one of these had a similar, but not identical, deletion. A heptamer-nonamer recognition sequence (located approximately 70 kb 5' to C alpha), not associated with a TCR gene coding segment, was found in the immediate vicinity of both 5' breakpoints. We have designated this sequence 5'del for 5' deleting element.

Recently, it has been possible to identify those circulating T-cells that are skin associated. These cells display the cell-surface phenotype of memory T cells (CD45RO+) and express the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, a tissue-selective homing receptor involved in directing T-cell traffic to inflamed skin. To investigate the participation of this skin-associated T-cell subset in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, we studied 16 patients with erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma for the presence of these surface proteins on circulating cells. Results were compared with eight patients in remission and eight with minimal patch-plaque cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The mean expression of both CD45RO and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen were significantly greater in the erythrodermic patients than in the other two patient groups. Expression of these markers was shown to be on the cells of the malignant clone by two-color flow cytometry. These results demonstrate that the malignant cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma express the markers of skin homing lymphocytes and that their levels are increased in the erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients. Moreover, the findings suggest a critical role for the skin-selective homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte antigen in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.","['Heald, P W', 'Yan, S L', 'Edelson, R L', 'Tigelaar, R', 'Picker, L J']","['Heald PW', 'Yan SL', 'Edelson RL', 'Tigelaar R', 'Picker LJ']","['Department of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/pharmacology', 'E-Selectin', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology/physiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/etiology/immunology/ultrastructure', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*etiology/*ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(93)90444-M [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12364814 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1993 Aug;101(2):222-6. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12364814.,"['5R01CA4305806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI31545-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CTAGE1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the morphology and temporal appearance of filamentous actin (F-actin) after activation. Similarly, little is known about the relationship between F-actin and changes in cell shape or other parameters of activation, such as the appearance of proteins newly phosphorylated on tyrosine, that occur after stimulation via the CD3/Ti complex. Accordingly, we have characterized changes in cell shape and F-actin morphology occurring in the Jurkat T cell leukemia attached to the surface of culture vessels by immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies (OKT3, UCHT-1, SPV-T3b). These antibodies induced activation within 30 min as measured by increased protein tyrosine kinase activity and conversion of the proto-oncogene product, lck, from 56 kDa to 60 kDa (p56lck conversion), and after 12 to 96 h as measured by growth arrest and, in some experiments, IL-2 production. Activation was not seen when cells were attached to the substrates using antibodies directed to other cell surface proteins including CD71 (transferrin receptor), CD7, and CD11a (LFA-1), demonstrating the specificity of activation for immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies. Temporal changes in cell shape and F-actin morphology were characterized in Jurkat cells attached by immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies (stimulatory antibodies) and compared with the patterns obtained obtained in Jurkat cells attached by antibodies specific for the other markers (nonstimulatory antibodies). In these experiments, Jurkat cells were incubated with antibody-coated substrates for 1 to 30 min at 37 degrees C and actin rearrangements were visualized on fixed, detergent-permeabilized cells using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Analysis of cell shape and F-actin morphology during the first 30 min of activation revealed a unique pattern that was observed only when cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies. Jurkat cells attached by either stimulatory or nonstimulatory antibodies reorganized their actin similarly after the first minute of culture, as characterized by the formation of small, F-actin rich pseudopods at the sites of attachment. After 5 min of culture in cells attached by stimulatory antibodies, the actin was polymerized into a dense collar rimming the inner edge of the cell. From 15 to 60 min, this collar was replaced by numerous F-actin rich, branched pseudopods. These branched pseudopods were larger and had longer microfilament bundles than their earlier counterparts. By contrast, in cells attached by nonstimulatory antibodies, the initial configuration was maintained for at least 60 min, except that a decrease in microfilament bundle length was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Parsey, M V', 'Lewis, G K']","['Parsey MV', 'Lewis GK']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland Medical School, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*ultrastructure', 'Actins/*physiology', 'CD3 Complex/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Transferrin/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Aug 15;151(4):1881-93.,"['AI-25863/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-26665/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These substrates were selected because they represent the site for the first template switch during proviral DNA synthesis. Variability of cleavage was observed depending on the origin of the enzyme as well as the sequence of the RNA/DNA substrate. The minimal size of hybrid recognized by the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase was also affected by the same parameters, namely, the enzyme and the substrate origin. Moreover, the size of the residual 5'-undigested RNA after completion of the RNase H reaction depended on the position of the DNA annealed to the genomic RNA. When the hybrid was located at the 5' R region of the viral genome, stable hybrids with RNAs of 13-18 nucleotides remained following digestion by HIV reverse transcriptase, and 21-24 nucleotides following digestion by AMV reverse transcriptase and MMuLV reverse transcriptase. On the other hand, with all three enzymes, smaller sized hybrids remained when the DNA was hybridized to internal U5 or R sequences. The reason for this variance in size appears to be the inability of RNase H to efficiently digest at the 5' end of hybrid structures. Surprisingly, hybridization to the RNA template, of a DNA oligomer that extended 15 nucleotides beyond the 5' end of the RNA R region sequences, resulted in further digestion of the RNA. This unexpected mode of action of RNase H at the 5' end of the genomic RNA should be taken in consideration in studies of the first template switch.","['Ben-Artzi, H', 'Zeelon, E', 'Amit, B', 'Wortzel, A', 'Gorecki, M', 'Panet, A']","['Ben-Artzi H', 'Zeelon E', 'Amit B', 'Wortzel A', 'Gorecki M', 'Panet A']","['BioTechnology General Ltd., Kiryat Weizmann, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'HIV/enzymology/*genetics', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1993/08/05 00:00,1993/08/05 00:01,['1993/08/05 00:00'],"['1993/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85443-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 5;268(22):16465-71.,['R1AI33353A/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since apoptosis has been associated with potential involvement of intracellular signaling linked to the Ca2+/calmodulin and protein kinase C transduction pathways, we also investigated the effects of signaling modulators on camptothecin- and teniposide-induced secondary DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells. Neither calcium chelators, calcium/calmodulin inhibitors (calmidazolium or cyclosporine A), protein kinase C stimulation by TPA, protein phosphatase inhibition by okadaic acid, protein kinase inhibition by staurosporine, calphostin C, genistein or H7, nor cell cycle alterations by caffeine had any detectable effect. Interestingly, most of these intracellular signaling modulators were able to induce DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells by themselves. These results may suggest that even though modulation of these signaling pathways was unable to prevent topoisomerase inhibitor-induced apoptosis, their sole deregulations could induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In contrast, aphidicolin blocked camptothecin-induced secondary DNA fragmentation, indicating that replication-induced DNA damage is required for camptothecin- but not teniposide-induced secondary DNA fragmentation. Zinc, 3-aminobenzamide, and spermine also modulated both camptothecin- and teniposide-induced secondary DNA fragmentation without significant alteration of topoisomerase-mediated primary DNA strand breaks. Hence, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and chromatin structure may be important in modulating oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis in HL-60 cells treated with topoisomerase inhibitors.","['Bertrand, R', 'Solary, E', 'Jenkins, J', 'Pommier, Y']","['Bertrand R', 'Solary E', 'Jenkins J', 'Pommier Y']","['Institut du Cancer de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Naphthalenes', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/biosynthesis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Polycyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Spermine/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(83)71206-1 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1993.1206 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1993 Aug;207(2):388-97. doi: 10.1006/excr.1993.1206.,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polycyclic Compounds)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'O448IDK23O (Quin2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike D+ cells, JCS cells did not produce differentiated granulocyte-macrophage colonies in the presence of postendotoxin serum or recombinant G-CSF. Stimulation with PMA or TNF-alpha reduced proliferation of JCS cells. TNF-alpha decreased the level of cell surface J11D antigen with concurrent increased expression of Mac-1 and FcR antigens and phagocytic activity. These TNF-alpha-mediated effects were enhanced by addition of IFN-gamma to the cultures. Furthermore, differentiation-inducing activity of PMA could be prevented using neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.

Flow cytometry was used to show that ATP4- induced the entry of ethidium+ (314 Da) but that the larger propidium2+ cation (414 Da) was excluded. ATP(4-)-induced entry of both Ba2+ and ethidium+ showed features previously demonstrated for smaller cation permeants: (i) inhibition by amiloride analogs, (ii) sigmoid dependence of flux on ATP concentrations, and (iii) inhibition by extracellular Na+ ions. Specific inhibitors of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (nisoldipine and diltiazem) had no effect on ATP(4-)-induced Ba2+ influx. Suramin and reactive blue 2, which are recognized antagonists of ATP-operated purinergic receptors in other tissues, inhibited ATP-induced uptake of ethidium+ in lymphocytes with K1/2 of 61 and 69 microM, respectively. However, hexamethylene amiloride was a more potent inhibitor of ATP-induced ethidium+ uptake with a K1/2 of 13 microM.

In Jurkat cells, resting peripheral T lymphocytes, T lymphoblasts, CD8+ T lymphoblasts and a CD4+ T cell clone, CD3 stimulation induced a strong but transient tyrosine phosphorylation of at least 15 polypeptides. However, in peripheral T cells and T blasts, the kinetics of phosphorylation were considerably slower than in Jurkat cells. The pattern of phosphotyrosyl polypeptides induced by CD3 stimulation was similar, although some differences were noted between normal T cells and Jurkat, especially at the level of the extent of phosphorylation. As had been previously reported for Jurkat T cells, a qualitatively similar tyrosine phosphorylation response was induced upon CD2 or CD3 stimulation in each of the analysed T cell populations, suggesting that CD3 and CD2 share a common pathway of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activation. In HPB. ALL leukemia T cells (which express very low levels of CD45), both CD3 and CD2 stimulation induced only very weak protein tyrosyl phosphorylation. However, a 50 kDa polypeptide, which was part of an inducible doublet in Jurkat or normal T lymphocytes, was constitutively tyrosyl-phosphorylated in the HPB. ALL line. These results suggest that there is a common pathway of early PTK activation following CD3- or CD2-mediated stimulation in mature T cells, whether they express surface CD4 or CD8, and also that the PTK may be differently regulated in different T cell populations leading to different kinetics or intensity of tyrosyl phosphorylation.","['Boyer, C', 'Ley, S', 'Davies, A', 'Crumpton, M']","['Boyer C', 'Ley S', 'Davies A', 'Crumpton M']","['Cell Surface Biochemistry Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(93)90014-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1993 Jul;30(10):903-10. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(93)90014-3.,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inhibitory action of TGF-beta 1 could be reversed by a neutralizing anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody. Studies on the mechanism of TGF-beta 1 inhibition of SCF-induced proliferation of AML blasts revealed that TGF-beta 1 treatment of these cells was associated with down-regulation of SCF receptor surface expression, as detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, which appeared to be preferentially due to an acceleration of decay of mRNA for the c-kit proto-oncogene encoding the SCF receptor, without an effect on the overall transcriptional activity of the c-kit gene. Direct evidence to prove the importance of c-kit down-regulation in the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 on AML growth came also from experiments demonstrating that signal transduction of SCF could be significantly diminished in the presence of TGF-beta 1, as demonstrated by measuring c-kit kinase-associated phosphorylation of target proteins.","['de Vos, S', 'Brach, M A', 'Asano, Y', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Gruss, H J', 'Herrmann, F']","['de Vos S', 'Brach MA', 'Asano Y', 'Ludwig WD', 'Bettelheim P', 'Gruss HJ', 'Herrmann F']","['Abteilung fur Medizinische Onkologie und Angewandte Molekularbiologie, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Freie Universitat Berlin, Max-Delbruck Centrum fur Molekulare Medizin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Aug 1;53(15):3638-42.,,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In ""adoptive immunotherapy,"" a combination of LAK administration and IL-2 infusion was found to be effective therapy for some tumors and ineffective for others. Here we report a novel function for IL-2, its ability to protect tumor cells (cell lines obtained from hairy cell leukemia patients) against LAK activity. The protective effect induced by IL-2 is similar to that induced by interferon (IFN). Protection by both cytokines requires new mRNA/protein synthesis; both IL-2 and IFN reduce the ability of tumor target cells to trigger LAK effector cells following binding between these two types of cells. However, endogenous IFN is not the mediator of the IL-2 protective effect against LAK activity since monoclonal antibodies against IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma did not abolish the protective effect of IL-2. In addition, IL-2 does not induce the expression of class I major histocompatibility complex antigens on the target cell surface, believed to be the signal for the IFN-induced protection against natural killer and LAK activities. Finally, leukemic cells resistant to IFN-alpha did respond to IL-2 treatment and became less sensitive to LAK cytotoxicity. Thus the ability of IL-2 to protect tumor cells from LAK activity may explain the lack of response to adoptive immunotherapy in tumors that express the IL-2 receptor.","['Reiter, Z', 'Taylor, M W']","['Reiter Z', 'Taylor MW']","['Division of Morphological Sciences, Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferons/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Aug 1;53(15):3555-60.,['CA-53783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MIRL is expressed by all hematopoietic elements and by a wide variety of nonhematopoietic tissues. A deficiency of MIRL is primarily responsible for the greater sensitivity of the erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria to complement mediated lysis. Because of its critical role in protecting host cells from injury by complement, we hypothesized that mechanisms exist that allow MIRL expression to be regulated. To investigate this hypothesis, both MIRL RNA and MIRL protein expression were analyzed following exposure of K562 erythroleukemia cells to a variety of potential stimulants. Incubation with dexamethasone, calcium ionophore, lipopolysaccharide, interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, hemin, and cyclic AMP had no effect on MIRL expression. However, incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA), induced a marked increase in MIRL RNA as determined by Northern blot analysis. This enhanced expression of MIRL RNA was associated with an increase in MIRL protein expression as determined by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins, Western blot analysis, and immunobinding assay. Enhanced MIRL RNA expression was first detected after 8 hours and increased through 24 hours of observation. Inhibitors of either protein synthesis or transcription abrogated the PMA-induced enhancement of MIRL RNA expression. Together, these results are consistent with a model in which PMA induces synthesis of a trans acting protein that enhances transcription of the MIRL gene.","['Holguin, M H', 'Martin, C B', 'Weis, J H', 'Parker, C J']","['Holguin MH', 'Martin CB', 'Weis JH', 'Parker CJ']","['Research Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salt Lake City, UT 84148.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'CD55 Antigens', 'CD59 Antigens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82387-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 1;82(3):968-77.,"['R01 AI24158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK35830/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 AI33044/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['CD59', 'DAF', 'MIRL']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Multivariate analysis showed that the prognostic influence of the antigen was independent of age, leukocyte count, and other well-recognized factors, suggesting that it would add discriminatory power to current systems of risk assignment. Findings in T-cell ALL were the reverse: CD34 expression showed positive correlations with initial CNS leukemia and CD10 negativity but not with any good-risk presenting characteristics.

Southern analysis of the seven transduced clones selected for neomycin resistance in Geneticin (G-418 sulfate) demonstrated one to eight copies of intact provirus with rearrangements in only two clones. Absolute levels of human GC RNA and protein increased with increased copy numbers of provirus in the clones. Upon induction with IL-6 of the seven transduced clones to the macrophage phenotype, there was no significant change, overall, in RNA levels but some increase in human GC protein levels could be detected. Although this was the average trend, considerable clonal variation in RNA and protein levels was observed upon induction. Transduction of the M1 cells did not interfere with the ability of the cells to differentiate from blasts to macrophages as seen by the appearance of membrane receptors for the constant region of immunoglobulins (Fc gamma RI) and lysozyme production in the differentiated M1 cells. Thus, the M1 cell line can be used for testing retroviral vector expression in myeloid lineages at early and late stages of differentiation.

This wide variability may be attributed to a number of reasons including lack of consistent diagnostic criteria, use of various panels of antibodies, and the failure to recognize the lack of lineage specificity of some of the antibodies used. The morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotype and cytogenetics of acute biphenotypic leukaemias from our institution were studied. The diagnostic criteria took into consideration the morphology of the analysed cells, light scatter characteristics, and evaluation of antibody fluorescence histograms in determining whether the aberrant marker expression was arising from leukaemic blasts or differentiated bone marrow elements. Fifty-two of 746 cases (7%) fulfilled our criteria for acute biphenotypic leukaemias. These included 30 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) expressing myeloid antigens, 21 cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) expressing lymphoid markers, and one case of ALL expressing both B- and T-cell associated antigens. The acute biphenotypic leukaemia cases consisted of four major immunophenotypic subgroups: CD2+ AML (11), CD19+ AML (8), CD13 and/or CD33+ ALL (24), CD11b+ ALL (5) and others (4). Chromosomal analysis was carried out in 42/52 of the acute biphenotypic leukaemia cases; a clonal abnormality was found in 31 of these 42 cases. This study highlights the problems encountered in the diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukaemia, some of which may be responsible for the wide variation in the reported incidence of this leukaemia. We suggest that the use of strict, uniform diagnostic criteria may help in establishing a more consistent approach towards diagnosis of this leukaemic entity. We also suggest that biphenotypic leukaemia is comprised of biologically different groups of leukaemia based on immunophenotypic and cytogenetic findings.","['Hanson, C A', 'Abaza, M', 'Sheldon, S', 'Ross, C W', 'Schnitzer, B', 'Stoolman, L M']","['Hanson CA', 'Abaza M', 'Sheldon S', 'Ross CW', 'Schnitzer B', 'Stoolman LM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Hospitals, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Michigan/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03024.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 May;84(1):49-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03024.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circulating progenitors including colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), burst forming-unit erythroid (BFU-E) and multilineage colony forming unit (CFU-Mix) were studied serially on alternate days during a recovery phase from chemotherapy for consolidation of complete remission. In 18 patients with acute leukaemia, 27 courses of consolidation chemotherapy were performed with a combination of an intermediate-dose cytosine arabinoside with etoposide (Ara-C/Etop) or mitoxantron (Ara-C/Mit). G-CSF (5 micrograms/kg) was administered during the recovery phase in 6/14 courses with Ara-C/Etop and in 4/13 courses with Ara-C/Mit. G-CSF induced a significant and synchronized increase of circulating CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Mix by more than 4-fold at their peaks. The peak of CFU-GM was significantly correlated with that of both BFU-E and CFU-Mix, irrespective of additional G-CSF mobilization. G-CSF also produced a significant increase of monocytes in a synchronized fashion with an increase of circulating CFU-GM. Interestingly, peripheral blood monocytes spontaneously produced high concentrations of IL-6; a significant correlation was observed between absolute monocyte counts and plasma levels of IL-6 or peak levels of CFU-GM. These observations indicate that the addition of G-CSF to chemotherapy-induced mobilization can facilitate further expansion of a blood progenitor pool during the haematopoietic recovery, probably through the stimulation of monocytes to proliferate and to induce their monokine production such as IL-6. The data also suggest that absolute monocyte counts may be a useful indicator to predict the peak of circulating progenitors for collecting autologous blood stem cells.","['Liu, K Y', 'Akashi, K', 'Harada, M', 'Takamatsu, Y', 'Niho, Y']","['Liu KY', 'Akashi K', 'Harada M', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/pathology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03022.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 May;84(1):31-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03022.x.,,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the mitogenic activity of recombinant human SCF on myeloid leukemia cells as well as the expression of its receptor was tested. The proliferation of myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as fresh myeloid leukemic blasts from patients was investigated in a 72 h 3H-thymidine uptake assay in the presence of various concentrations of rhSCF alone or in combination with saturating concentrations of G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, or erythropoietin (EPO). Only five out of 30 lines, but fresh leukemic blasts from 75% of the AML blast samples significantly responded to SCF. To determine the SCF binding sites on leukemic cells, 125I-radiolabelled SCF was used in Scatchard analysis and cross-linking studies. Crosslinking studies demonstrated a 150 kD SCF receptor on the surface of some myeloid leukemic cell lines and all blast preparations. The response to SCF did not correlate to the receptor numbers expressed on the cell surface or to a certain subtype of myeloid leukemia. Using PCR analysis of total RNA from the myeloid leukemia lines we found coexpression of SCF-mRNA and SCF receptor-mRNA in 29% of the myeloid leukemia lines. Soluble as well as membrane bound SCF protein was found to be expressed in myeloid leukemia cells by monoclonal antibodies generated against SCF. This suggests autocrine mechanisms in the growth of a subgroup of leukemic cells by coexpression of SCF and its receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Pietsch, T']",['Pietsch T'],"['Institute of Neuropathology, University of Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1993 Jun;35(3):285-6.,,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, the experimental drug suramin is shown to inhibit in a dose-dependent fashion the cell response to these cytokines, with the exception of TNF-alpha. The action of the IL-6-type cytokines is more sensitive to suramin inhibition that that of IL-1 beta. The effect of suramin is detectable within 30 min at the level of gene transcription and appears to be mediated by the impairment of receptor function and/or signal transduction, rather than by the inhibition of nucleic acid polymerases or DNA topoisomerase II. Similar analysis of human hepatoma HepG2 cells indicated a several-fold higher resistance to suramin and in inhibition that was less cytokine-specific than in H-35 cells. The data suggest that suramin has the potential not only to modulate the proliferation or differentiation of tumor cells as described previously, but also to affect a differentiated cell function. This broad pleiotropic action has to be taken into consideration when applying suramin as a therapeutic agent.","['Baumann, H', 'Strassmann, G']","['Baumann H', 'Strassmann G']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Suramin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Aug 1;151(3):1456-62.,['CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously described an increase in PLC activity associated with the particulate fraction of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells after Fc epsilon RI aggregation, and this redistribution of enzyme activity correlated with an increase in immunoreactivity of the gamma 1 isozyme of PLC in the particulate fraction by Western blot analysis (J. Immunol. 148:2194-2200, 1992). We now report that the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate mimics Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PLC-gamma 1 in RBL cells after permeabilization with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. Orthovanadate treatment of permeabilized cells induced: 1) a large increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in endogenously labeled cells; 2) an increase in PLC activity associated with the particulate fraction; and 3) an increase in immunoreactivity of PLC-gamma 1 in Western blots of the particulate fraction. In addition, incubation of RBL cells with either oligomeric IgE or orthovanadate results in the translocation of PLC-gamma 2 from the cytosol to the particulate fraction. All of the above effects were qualitatively similar to those seen after Fc epsilon RI aggregation. These data suggest that translocation and activation of PLC in mast cells are controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation of either the enzyme itself or some regulatory component. The equilibrium can be shifted to the phosphorylated state during either receptor-mediated activation of a tyrosine kinase or by blockade of dephosphorylation.","['Atkinson, T P', 'Lee, C W', 'Rhee, S G', 'Hohman, R J']","['Atkinson TP', 'Lee CW', 'Rhee SG', 'Hohman RJ']","['Allergic Diseases Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Enzyme Activation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Aug 1;151(3):1448-55.,,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the detection of significant serum IL-4 levels in a case of acute transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia with a predominant basophilic cell population. Leukemic basophils were isolated from patients' PBMC and assayed for their IL-4-mRNA expression and their ability to secrete this cytokine in vitro. Leukemic basophilic cells (> 90% toluidine blue positive) but not other PBMC expressed IL-4-mRNA, contained IL-4 protein, and secreted this cytokine. These cells had a spontaneous IL-4 secretion ability, without a need for an exogenous activator. Meanwhile, IL-4 release was significantly increased following leukemic cell activation through Fc epsilon RI-ligation or by Ca2+ ionophore. IL-4 and its mRNA were also detected in leukemic basophils from three other chronic myelogenous leukemia patients with moderate basophilia (13, 14, and 23% basophils in PBMC). To confirm these data in normal human cells, we have developed a method to obtain large numbers of purified basophils from human bone marrow cell cultures. In contrast to leukemic basophils, normal cells required in vitro activation through Fc epsilon RI ligation or by Ca2+ ionophore to express and secrete IL-4. Leukemic and normal basophils secreted histamine following in vitro activation, but were negative for tryptase. These data thus demonstrate the in vivo and in vitro ability of human basophils to produce IL-4.","['Arock, M', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Dugas, B', 'Ouaaz, F', 'Le Goff, L', 'Vouldoukis, I', 'Mencia-Huerta, J M', 'Schmitt, C', 'Leblond-Missenard, V', 'Debre, P']","['Arock M', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Dugas B', 'Ouaaz F', 'Le Goff L', 'Vouldoukis I', 'Mencia-Huerta JM', 'Schmitt C', 'Leblond-Missenard V', 'Debre P', 'et al.']","['Immunology Department, CNRS URA625, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Basophils/cytology/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation', 'Gene Expression', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Aug 1;151(3):1441-7.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four of these mAb had neutralizing activity of HTLV-1 as determined by an HTLV-1-induced syncytium formation inhibition assay in vitro. The reactivity of these neutralizing mAb was studied by using 9 different synthetic peptides covering immunodominant regions of the gp46. Thirteen out of these 24 neutralizing mAb reacted with gp46 peptide 175-199, whereas one mAb reacted with gp46 213-236 and another one with gp46 288-317. The other 9 neutralizing mAb did not react with any of these peptides. Fine epitope mapping of the mAb reacting with gp46 peptide 175-199 revealed the presence of 4 distinct neutralizing B-cell epitopes on this region; (1)187-193, (2)191-196, (3)193-199, and (4) continuous conformational B-cell epitope. The competitive antibody-binding inhibition experiments by soluble phase synthetic peptides showed that the binding activity of these neutralizing mAb to the corresponding synthetic peptides is equal to or a little lower than that to native gp46 protein, suggesting that synthetic peptides can form structure very similar to the neutralizing epitopes on native gp46 protein. The present study is the first systematic demonstration of multiple neutralizing B-cell epitopes of HTLV-1 in human HTLV-1 infection.

All of them were given at first an inductive chemotherapy with 3-4 courses of BACOP regimen before ABMT. 40-50 days later, Vp-16, CTX and TBI were given as a conditioning regimen (case 1: TLI). Case 1 and 2 only reached partial remission after inductive treatment (case 2: relapse at primary sites one month after inductive therapy, but complete remission (CR) of bone marrow). All of the four patients reached CR after ABMT. Case 2 had systemic relapse (bone marrow blast cells: 8%) at 110 days after CR and died from relapse 210 days after ABMT. So far, case 1, 3 and 4 have survived free of disease for 24, 19 and 9 months, respectively. There was no fatal marrow transplant regimen-related toxicity during inductive and ABMT treatment.

Determination of the activity of both the antibody and drug moieties was carried out in vitro using a pre-B cell human acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line (NALM-6). A 23% loss in antibody binding and a 20-fold loss in drug activity were observed upon conjugation. Selective cytotoxicity for CD19+ cells, however, was obtained. Measurement of the cytotoxicity, antibody activity and release of the breakdown product, 14-OH-Ida, showed that the conjugates remained stable for more than 100 days after lyophilization and storage at -20 degrees C. In vivo studies were performed in irradiated nu/nu mice bearing NALM-6 tumours. Initial dose response studies with free idarubicin demonstrated that three i.p. doses (every other day) of 10 micrograms resulted in little antitumour activity, but the death of all the animals by day 23. The same treatment regime using 15 micrograms Ida-anti-CD19 conjugate caused the disappearance of four out of five tumours with three complete cures and no evidence of toxicity as assessed by weight loss. Administration of a conjugate of idarubicin with an irrelevant antibody at this dose led to no significant antitumour response. The administration of free drug at a dose of 6 micrograms resulted in a minor antitumour response but high toxicity, whereas injection of Ida-anti-CD19 conjugate at this dose caused no toxicity and a substantial antitumour effect with eradication of two out of five tumours. These results clearly demonstrate that the administration of Ida-anti-CD19 conjugates can result in complete tumour regression in an experimental model. Idarubicin-containing immunoconjugates should be useful for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Rowland, A J', 'Pietersz, G A', 'McKenzie, I F']","['Rowland AJ', 'Pietersz GA', 'McKenzie IF']","['Austin Research Institute, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01525435 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1993 Aug;37(3):195-202. doi: 10.1007/BF01525435.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the synthesis, degradation and processing, and steady state levels of specific RNA species during exposure to ELF radiation were determined in human leukemia HL-60 cells. The overall steady state RNA levels, assessed by continuous and equilibrium labeling with 3H-uridine, were not affected by ELF exposure. Northern blot analysis using probes specific for c-myc, beta-actin, and 45S ribosomal RNA gene products revealed that ELF did not alter the steady state levels of these RNAs. Examination of gene-specific transcription by a novel nuclease protection assay revealed that while ELF did not substantially alter the transcription rates for c-myc and beta-actin, transcription of the 45S ribosomal RNA gene was increased by 40-50%. To explain the observed increase in the synthesis of 45S ribosomal RNA without an associated increase in its steady state level, the degradation and processing of the ribosomal gene transcript in the presence and absence of an ELF field were followed by pulse-chase 3H-uridine labeling. This revealed that ELF radiation accelerated both the processing and degradation of the ribosomal RNA transcript. During ELF exposure, the half-life of the 45S ribosomal RNA was decreased from 115 min. to 85 min. These results show that ELF can selectively affect RNA levels by modulating either the transcription rate and/or RNA post-transcriptional processing and turnover.","['Greene, J J', 'Pearson, S L', 'Skowronski, W J', 'Nardone, R M', 'Mullins, J M', 'Krause, D']","['Greene JJ', 'Pearson SL', 'Skowronski WJ', 'Nardone RM', 'Mullins JM', 'Krause D']","['Department of Biology, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC 20064.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/radiation effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1993 May;39(3):261-8.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three of these patients, infections resolved when neutropoiesis recovered. In one patient with very severe neutropenia (30/microliters), in whom myeloid progenitors were not detectable, G-CSF therapy failed to restore granulopoiesis. Cessation or interruption of G-CSF after 2-5 weeks of therapy resulted in a rapid decline of neutrophil counts to lower or subnormal levels (median value 1478/microliters, range 770-2739) within 1 week, suggesting that the improvement of granulopoiesis was dependent on G-CSF and not due to IFN-a therapy.

We have characterized two independent deletions in this region, one derived from a patient with AML who previously had a T-cell lymphoma, and another from a Wilms' tumor patient. Cytogenetic analysis of the ML-2 cell line established from the malignant cells of the AML patient indicated that one chromosome 11 homolog had an interstitial deletion, del(11) (q23q24), and the remaining homolog was involved in a recurring translocation, t(6;11) (q27;q23). According to karyotype analysis on the Wilms' tumor patient (EH), one chromosome 11 was normal and the other carried an interstitial deletion at 11q23.3-11q25. Somatic cell hybrids segregating the EH deletion (EHR4) and the ML-2 deletion (MLR4) have been isolated. The EH deletion is distal to the MLL probe recently associated with 11q23.3 leukemia breakpoints (Ziemin-van der Poel et al.: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88:10735-10739, 1991). The ML-2 deletion could involve the MLL gene at a point distal to other breakpoints within MLL. Both deletions include the Ewing's sarcoma breakpoint at 11q24.1. By Southern blot analysis we identified three anonymous DNA markers (D11S272, D11S273, and D11S219) and the ETS/oncogene, which map within each deleted region.

Among these, three T helper cell clones were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and the fourth was isolated from a (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mouse. All these clones proliferated in response to the immunizing FBL-3 tumor cells in a major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted manner. Each clone expressed a distinct T-cell receptor with a characteristic combination of alpha and beta chains. The localization of helper T-cell determinants on viral proteins was analyzed with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) gag or env genes or shorter fragments of the env gene. Epitopes recognized by these T-cell clones were mapped to at least two distinct portions in the env region of the F-MuLV genome. These epitopes were identified more precisely with synthetic peptides derived from the F-MuLV envelope protein sequence. One of these epitopes was common to Friend and Moloney MuLVs and was located in the N-terminal region of the gp70 glycoprotein at amino acids 122 to 141. The second epitope, which was recognized in the context of hybrid I-Eb/d major histocompatibility complex class II molecule, was located close to the C-terminal end of gp70 at amino acids 462 to 479. In addition, a possible third epitope was located in the N-terminal half of the gp70 sequence and differed from the first epitope in that it was not cross-reactive with the Moloney MuLV envelope protein.","['Iwashiro, M', 'Kondo, T', 'Shimizu, T', 'Yamagishi, H', 'Takahashi, K', 'Matsubayashi, Y', 'Masuda, T', 'Otaka, A', 'Fujii, N', 'Ishimoto, A']","['Iwashiro M', 'Kondo T', 'Shimizu T', 'Yamagishi H', 'Takahashi K', 'Matsubayashi Y', 'Masuda T', 'Otaka A', 'Fujii N', 'Ishimoto A', 'et al.']","['Institute for Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Epitopes/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Genes, env', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.8.4533-4542.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Aug;67(8):4533-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.8.4533-4542.1993.,,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,"['GENBANK/D12893', 'GENBANK/D12894', 'GENBANK/D12895', 'GENBANK/D12896', 'GENBANK/D12897', 'GENBANK/D12898', 'GENBANK/D12899', 'GENBANK/D12900']",['env'],,PMC237837,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the utility of recombinant cytokines in alleviating the hematopoietic complications of AIDS and AIDS therapy has been evaluated. The newly cloned cytokine stem cell factor (SCF) has been demonstrated to be a potent regulator of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of SCF to alleviate thrombocytopenia caused by infection with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (mLV) in a murine model of AIDS (MAIDS). In addition, we evaluated the effects of SCF on previously demonstrated azidothymidine (AZT)-induced elevations of platelet counts. SCF was administered to normal or LP-BMS-infected C57BL/6 mice in combination with oral AZT for up to 1 month and effects on platelet, megakaryocyte (MK), and megakaryocyte colony-forming cell (CFU-MK) numbers were evaluated. SCF alone significantly increased the number of circulating platelets in thrombocytopenic MAIDS mice by 53%. SCF also significantly elevated platelet levels by 29% in normal mice. AZT elevated platelet counts 100% in normal and 50% in MAIDS mice. AZT and SCF increased platelet counts in an additive manner. SCF alone was a potent inducer of splenic CFU-MK in both MAIDS and normal mice, increasing splenic CFU-MK 13- to 15-fold at day 15 as compared with untreated controls. By day 30, however, the numbers of splenic CFU-MK had returned to control levels. In infected mice, AZT alone increased the number of splenic CFU-MK. SCF administered to AZT-treated MAIDS mice did not further enhance these increases. In contrast, in normal mice, AZT decreased splenic CFU-MK numbers. In AZT-treated mice, SCF enhanced the numbers of splenic CFU-MK 90-fold at day 8. In MAIDS mice, the number of bone marrow CFU-MK was significantly increased by SCF treatment at all time points. SCF significantly affected the total number of femoral CFU-MK in AZT-treated mice only at day 15. In normal mice, SCF or SCF and AZT in combination increased the total number of bone marrow CFU-MK five-fold at day 8, but failed to induce changes in the total number of femoral CFU-MK after that. These results indicate that SCF elevates platelet levels in both thrombocytopenic MAIDS and normal mice and profoundly affects CFU-MK proliferation. Combinations of SCF and AZT may be further explored to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of these two drugs in alleviating thrombocytopenia.","['Chow, F P', 'Zsebo, K', 'Hamburger, A W']","['Chow FP', 'Zsebo K', 'Hamburger AW']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*physiopathology', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Aug;21(9):1255-62.,['1R01 HL42069-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most of these cases the defects in chemiluminescence in 35 patients with hematological diseases. In most of these cases the defects in chemiluminescence in response to N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP) were correlated with those in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). But there were exceptional cases in which the maximal light emission of chemiluminescence (Max CL) in response to FMLP was obviously lower than controls despite the fact that the Max CL in response to PMA was the same as the controls. These facts suggest a heterogenicity of the defect site in these diseases. There was a correlation between the level of chemiluminescence and the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) activity in these patients. In vitro culture of CML neutrophils with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) showed a correlation between the increase in the level of chemiluminescence and NAP activity.

To assess this potential, we developed four immunotoxins (ITs) of anti-cCLLa monoclonal antibody CLL2m (an IgG2a kappa), using ricin chain A (RTA) or its deglycosylated derivative (dgA), each conjugated to either the whole IgG molecule or its Fab' fragment. Each IT was tested in vitro for specificity and cytotoxic activity (assessed by protein synthesis inhibition [PSI] and by cell kill [CK] in the clonogenic assay) against B-CLL cells. RTA-based anti-CD5 ITs and enriched normal B and T lymphocytes were used as controls. Each IT exhibited antigen-specific, dose-dependent activity. Thus, whereas B-CLL cells exhibited dose-dependent PSI and CK (whether the B-CLL clone was CD5+ or CD5-), normal B (cCLLa-/CD5-) and T lymphocytes (cCLLa-/CD5+) remained unaffected. IT potency was independent of toxin glycosylation, but was slightly influenced by antibody valence; divalent ITs were twice as potent as monovalent ITs (IC50, 2.3 v 7.1 x 10(-11) mol/L; CK, 2.6- v 2.0-log reached with 524 v 1,072 IT molecules bound/cell, respectively).

Because of the prominent role of CSF in the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis in vivo, we examined the effects of SCF on the Epo-inducible human erythroleukemia cell line MB-02, and characterized the c-kit receptor in these cells. MB-02 cells cultured in serum-containing media do not survive in the absence of exogenous growth factors, but the addition of SCF, Epo, or IL-3 as a single factor enhanced MB-02 survival. Furthermore, in the presence of Epo, SCF (5 to 25 ng/mL) enhanced MB-02 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and increased the relative and absolute number of benzidine-positive cells generated. SCF also enhanced cell proliferation in the presence of either IL-3 or low concentrations of GM-CSF. A neutralizing anti-c-kit receptor monoclonal antibody (SR-1) blocked binding of 125I-SCF to MB-02 cells by 98%, and the effect of SCF on MB-02 growth, c-kit receptor-binding parameters were quantitated by equilibrium-binding experiments with 125I-SCF. MB-02 cells display a single class of high-affinity (50 pmol/L) c-kit receptors, with approximately 8,000 receptors per cell. The molecular weight of the c-kit receptor was determined by affinity cross-linking 125I-SCF to MB-02 cells. 125I-SCF-c-kit receptor complexes of approximately 155,000 and approximately 310,000 daltons were found, likely representing the monomeric and dimeric forms of the c-kit receptor. The binding affinity and molecular weight of the c-kit receptor on MB-02 cells are similar to those of normal human marrow cells. These results suggest that SCF synergizes with Epo to influence not only the proliferation but the erythroid differentiation of MB-02 cells.

However, interest in this compound has expanded because of reports of its ability to affect cell differentiation and to alter eukaryotic gene expression. In an ongoing attempt to understand the biochemical effects of this compound, we examined the effects of 5-azacytidine on mitosis and on micronucleus formation in mammalian cells. In L5178Y mouse cells, 5-azacytidine induced micronuclei at concentrations at which we and others have already reported its mutagenicity at the tk locus. Using CREST staining and C-banding studies, we showed that the induced micronuclei contained mostly chromosomal fragments although some may have contained whole chromosomes. By incorporating BrdU into the DNA of SHE cells, we determined that micronuclei were induced only when the compound was added while the cells were in S phase. Microscopically visible effects due to 5-azacytidine treatment were not observed until anaphase of the mitosis following treatment or thereafter. 5-Azacytidine did not induce micronuclei via interference with formation of the metaphase chromosome arrangement in mitosis, a common mechanism leading to aneuploidy. Supravital UV microscopy revealed that chromatid bridges were observed in anaphase and, in some cases, were sustained into interphase. In the first mitosis after 5-azacytidine treatment we observed that many cells were unable to perform anaphase separation. All of these observations indicate that 5-azacytidine is predominantly a clastogen through its incorporation into DNA.","['Stopper, H', 'Korber, C', 'Schiffmann, D', 'Caspary, W J']","['Stopper H', 'Korber C', 'Schiffmann D', 'Caspary WJ']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Anaphase/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Azacitidine/*toxicity', 'Chromatids/*drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Heterochromatin/drug effects', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/ultrastructure', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Microscopy, Ultraviolet', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(93)90048-I [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(93)90048-i [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1993 Aug;300(3-4):165-77. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(93)90048-i.,,"['0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Mutagens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemogenic potential was assessed by comparing the regression lines drawn between the number of inoculated leukemic spleen cells and the mean survival time (MST) of the syngeneic recipients. rhG-CSF injected 2.5 micrograms daily for 14 days reduced the leukemogenic potential of spleen cells of the leukemic mice to 1/200 of the control. This phenomenon was not observed with the leukemic spleen cells treated with r-murine granulocyte-macrophage (rmGM)-CSF in vivo. Cytochemical study indicated that morphologically identifiable blast cells were fewer in the rhG-CSF-treated leukemic spleen. Furthermore, leukemic cells in the rhG-CSF-treated spleen were less proliferative than the control in spite of having more clonogenic cells in the leukemic cell preparation. Cytogenetical analysis showed that chromosome abnormalities found in the original leukemic cells were not altered by rhG-CSF administrations. It also showed that the frequency of the abnormal karyotype was reduced in rhG-CSF-treated leukemic spleen (4/17) as compared with the control (8/8), indicating that the mitotic fraction was smaller in the rhG-CSF-treated leukemic cells. These findings indicate that in addition to the reduced number of leukemic cells in the spleen cell preparation, a reduction of the proliferative capacity of the original leukemic cells is involved in the reduction of leukemogenic potential of leukemic cells treated with rhG-CSF in vivo.","['Tamura, M', 'Orita, T', 'Oh-eda, M', 'Hasegawa, M', 'Nomura, H', 'Maekawa, T', 'Abe, T', 'Ono, M']","['Tamura M', 'Orita T', 'Oh-eda M', 'Hasegawa M', 'Nomura H', 'Maekawa T', 'Abe T', 'Ono M']","['Fuji-Gotemba Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

Evidence for involvement of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.,71-82,"Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon B cell lymphoproliferative disease of unknown etiology. We previously observed that CD20, a membrane protein involved in B cell activation, is hyperphosphorylated on hairy cells and that these cells have unusually high levels of intracellular free Ca2+. Therefore, we used a hairy cell line, HCLL-7876, to study the potential involvement of Ca(2+)-activated protein kinases in CD20 phosphorylation. Addition of the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, increased CD20 phosphorylation both in activated B cells and in cells from the hairy cell line; addition of EGTA to either cell type decreased basal levels of CD20 phosphorylation. Ionomycin treatment of these cells resulted in increased kinase activity of cytosolic extracts toward syntide-2, a synthetic peptide substrate for calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM-KII), with kinetics similar to those of CD20 phosphorylation in the cell line. CD20 isolated from the cell line was a substrate for purified CaM-KII in vitro. Phosphopeptide maps of CD20 from untreated hairy cells or ionomycin-treated HCLL-7876 cells were similar to maps of CD20 that had been phosphorylated in vitro by CaM-KII. These results suggest that the unusually high levels of intracytoplasmic Ca2+ in hairy cells may enhance the phosphorylation of key surface proteins.","['Genot, E M', 'Meier, K E', 'Licciardi, K A', 'Ahn, N G', 'Uittenbogaart, C H', 'Wietzerbin, J', 'Clark, E A', 'Valentine, M A']","['Genot EM', 'Meier KE', 'Licciardi KA', 'Ahn NG', 'Uittenbogaart CH', 'Wietzerbin J', 'Clark EA', 'Valentine MA']","['Unite INSERM 196, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Jul 1;151(1):71-82.,"['GM37905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM42508/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agent possesses excellent antiviral activity at nontoxic doses in HIV-1-infected lymphocytes grown in tissue culture. Enzymatic kinetic studies of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT)-catalyzed RNA-directed DNA polymerase function were carried out in order to determine whether the inhibitor interacts with the template-primer or deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding sites of the polymerase. The data were analyzed using steady-state or Briggs-Haldane kinetics assuming that the template-primer binds to the enzyme first followed by the dNTP and that the polymerase functions processively. The calculated rate constants are in agreement with this model. The results show that the inhibitor acts as a mixed to noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both the template-primer and the dNTP binding sites of the enzyme. Hence, U-78036 inhibits the RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity of RT by interacting with a site distinct from the template-primer and dNTP binding sites. Moreover, the potency of U-78036 is dependent on the base composition of the template-primer. The equilibrium constants for various enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complexes were at least seven times lower for the poly(rC).(dG)10-catalyzed system than the one catalyzed by poly(rA).(dT)10.

MK proliferation, ploidy distribution, and volume were studied by flow cytometry. IL-3 was the only cytokine that, alone, induced a marked increase in MK proliferation. At a high CD34+ cell concentration, addition of IL-6, SCF, and LIF to IL-3--containing medium increased the number of MK (approximately 20%). At a low CD34+ cell concentration, IL-3 alone was a less potent inducer of MK growth, but IL-6, SCF, and their combination had a marked effect, increasing the number of MK by a factor 1.7, 2.9, and 4.4, respectively. These differences may be related to the endogenous release of cytokines in the culture. The effects of these cytokines were subsequently tested on a more mature type of MK progenitor (CD34+ cells isolated after 6 days of incubation in liquid culture). IL-3 remained the most potent cytokine, but IL-6 or SCF alone also increased MK number in comparison to unstimulated cultures. The ploidy distribution of MKs grown with IL-3 was not markedly changed by the addition of the other cytokines, with the exception of SCF, which induced a significant increase in the mean ploidy. However, in all cultures, glycoprotein (GP)IIIa+ 2N and 4N cells were present in large but variable numbers (35% to 75%). The number of these low-ploidy MKs directly correlated with MK proliferation. Therefore, we subsequently explored the absolute number of polyploid MK produced in culture. SCF, IL-6, or their combination, in association with IL-3, increased the number of polyploid MK up to fourfold. In addition, they improved the maturation of MK grown in the presence of IL-3, leading to the synthesis of demarcation membranes and platelet shedding. A similar effect of growth factors on the maturation of day 6 CD34+ cells was observed. We conclude that IL-6 and SCF have a broad range of activities on megakaryocytopoiesis, acting both on the early and late stages. However, the proliferative properties of these cytokines largely predominate in our cultures. Therefore, in the absence of a specific MK regulator, this study further extends the need for a combination of growth factors to maximize megakaryocytopoiesis.","['Debili, N', 'Masse, J M', 'Katz, A', 'Guichard, J', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Debili N', 'Masse JM', 'Katz A', 'Guichard J', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM U 91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Ploidies', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81318-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 1;82(1):84-95.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Colony-forming cell assays supplemented with culture supernatants from OM-treated HEC contained a threefold increase in colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage colonies. Specific immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) of culture supernatants indicated that OM treatment of HEC resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in the accumulation of G-CSF and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) (> 28-fold). The ED50 for OM induction of G-CSF and GM-CSF protein expression was 17 and 7 pmol/L, respectively. Increased protein expression was associated with a similar increase in steady-state expression of G-CSF and GM-CSF mRNA. Furthermore, a period of 12 to 24 hours elapsed before there were measurable increases in CSF expression, suggesting that OM may stimulate CSF production through a mechanism requiring the synthesis or activation of a secondary mediating factor or pathway.

Previous studies have shown: (i) blast cells exposed to retinoic acid before cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) usually show increased sensitivity, but after some retinoic acid exposure times, sensitivity may be decreased; (ii) factor-sensitive or responsive blasts cultured with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are regularly more Ara-C-sensitive than when cultured with granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). This paper is concerned with the effects of schedule on drug sensitivity as regulated by either retinoic acid or the myelopoietic growth factors, G-CSF and GM-CSF. We measured the effects of retinoic acid on the sensitivity of blasts cells from the two continuous AML lines to Ara-C or arabinofuranosyl 5-azacytosine (Ara-AC). Cells from seven patients with AML were tested for Ara-C sensitivity in conjunction with retinoic acid. The cells were treated with retinoic acid before or after administration of the drug. Both increases and decreases in Ara-C sensitivity were seen for both schedules. Consistent increases in Ara-C sensitivity were obtained when retinoic acid was included in the methylcellulose cultures used to determine clonogenic cell recovery at each drug dose. In studies of growth factors, a single factor-dependent cell line (OCI/AML-5) was used to compare the effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on Ara-C sensitivity. An experimental design was used that permitted factors to present in culture for 24 h before Ara-C, during the next 24 h period with the drug, for a subsequent day in suspension without drug, and during the 5-7 days required for colony formation in methylcellulose cultures. G-CSF and GM-CSF were most effective in increasing or decreasing Ara-C, respectively, when the factor under test was included in the methylcellulose cultures. Thus, like retinoic acid, growth factors influenced drug sensitivity when they were present after the drug had been removed. These data, therefore, are compatible with the hypothesis that repair mechanism may contribute to regulated drug sensitivity.","['Yang, G S', 'Minden, M D', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Yang GS', 'Minden MD', 'McCulloch EA']","['Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylcellulose/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jul;7(7):1012-9.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the metabolization of deoxycytidine (dC) was severely impaired in all these cell lines.

Vmax values were unaltered in RCL/D and RA/7, and twofold increased in RCL/A. Addition of hydroxyurea (HU) to cell cultures stimulated dCk salvage pathway activity in RCL/0 cells for dC, AraC, and DAC by increasing Vmax values approximately 160% leaving Km constants unchanged. In all resistant cell lines, HU pre-incubation did not influence the level of dCk activity, leaving Km and Vmax values unaltered.

We found that staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase activities, induced morphological differentiation of human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells along myelomonocytic lineage and also induced functional differentiation (increase in nitroblue tetrazolium-reducing and lysozyme activities) in the cells. Several other protein kinase inhibitors such as 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), sphingosine, N-(6-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide and 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride (ML-9) did not induce the differentiation of ML-1 cells. Treatment with staurosporine induced formation of granules in ML-1 cells, and the granules showed metachromasia by toluidine blue staining; however, histamine content did not increase. The ""metachromatic"" ML-1 cells were positive for CD14, indicating that staurosporine induced the differentiation of ML-1 cells into metachromatic monocytes/macrophages, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) enhanced appearance of metachromatic granules in staurosporine-treated cells.

A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic potential in malignancy.,737-59,"Fludarabine is a fluorinated purine analogue with antineoplastic activity in lymphoproliferative malignancies. Noncomparative studies have shown response rates in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) that appear to be at least equivalent to those achieved with conventional therapy. Prolymphocytic leukaemia, a form of CLL which is often resistant to conventional chemotherapy, has also responded to treatment with fludarabine. Fludarabine combined with prednisone has also induced good response rates in patients with CLL but the limited data suggest that this does not offer an advantage over fludarabine alone. Several clinical trials have demonstrated a good cytoreductive response in patients with advanced, low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly that of follicular histology. Preliminary evidence indicates fludarabine in combination with cytarabine has therapeutic activity as salvage therapy in patients with acute leukaemia. Myelosuppression has been the major dose-limiting adverse effect reported in clinical trials of fludarabine. A reduction in CD4+ cell count may be associated with the increased incidence of fever and opportunistic infections in fludarabine recipients. Nausea and vomiting have also been commonly reported, but these are generally mild to moderate in severity. Reversible neurotoxicity has also been occasionally reported. Thus, fludarabine appears to offer a viable alternative to currently used treatments in CLL and low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Other potential areas of use for fludarabine include acute leukaemias. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and mycosis fungoides. However, trials of fludarabine in comparison with currently used therapies and also in combination with other antineoplastic agents are required to fully define its role in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. In addition, because relapse in these diseases is common, long term trials assessing improvement in survival duration and quality of life would be of value.","['Ross, S R', 'McTavish, D', 'Faulds, D']","['Ross SR', 'McTavish D', 'Faulds D']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199345050-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1993 May;45(5):737-59. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199345050-00009.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen consecutive patients with adult ALL (13 de novo, three relapsed) were treated with induction chemotherapy according to the BMFT protocol and received in addition r-metHuG-CSF (200 micrograms/m2/day). Patients who were treated with the same induction chemotherapy but without G-CSF between 1982 and 1990 served as controls. Fifteen of the 16 patients achieved complete hematological remission. One patient died because of fungal septicemia. Compared with historical controls, G-CSF-treated patients had a significantly faster neutrophil recovery in phase I, resulting in neutrophil counts > 1000/microliters at day 17 vs day 26 (in median) in controls. In phase II, the onset of severe leukocytopenia (< 1500/microliters) was significantly (p = 0.01) delayed and the degree of leukocytopenia less pronounced (mean nadir 3300/microliters) in G-CSF-treated patients compared with controls (1880/microliters). The number of days of febrile neutropenia was not different in phase I. In phase II it was lower in study patients (0 vs 1.1 days), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). Full doses of chemotherapy could be given on time to 11/13 (85%) G-CSF patients but to only 7/30 (23%) controls. These data indicate that (a) G-CSF can be given along with chemotherapy in induction treatment of ALL without compromising efficacy; (b) the duration of neutropenia in phase I is markedly shortened and the degree of leukocytopenia in phase II ameliorated; (c) these beneficial effects allow patients to receive full doses of chemotherapy on time.","['Scherrer, R', 'Geissler, K', 'Kyrle, P A', 'Gisslinger, H', 'Jager, U', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Laczika, K', 'Locker, G', 'Scholten, C', 'Sillaber, C']","['Scherrer R', 'Geissler K', 'Kyrle PA', 'Gisslinger H', 'Jager U', 'Bettelheim P', 'Laczika K', 'Locker G', 'Scholten C', 'Sillaber C', 'et al.']","['Division of Hematology, First Medical Department, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/complications', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Tegafur/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01695970 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 Jun;66(6):283-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01695970.,,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1548R74NSZ (Tegafur)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'BMFt protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthesis, deposition, and remodeling of extracellular matrix components and migration by vascular endothelial cells are major factors in determining luminal diameter, cellular proliferative and migratory responses, and mononuclear cell adhesion at sites of injury. Previously, we have shown that after in vivo and in vitro denudation injury, endothelial cell migration is dramatically influenced by the amount of fibronectin synthesized and deposited by the responding endothelial cell population. The aim of this study was to elucidate the roles of fibronectin in modulating mononuclear cell adhesion to the endothelial cell population during in vitro migration. In this report we demonstrate that U937 cell binding to the migrating fronts of endothelial cell monolayers is modulated by the amount of fibronectin synthesized and deposited by the endothelial cells. Agents which increase fibronectin deposition, such as transforming growth factor-beta 1, elicit greater U937 cell adhesion. Manipulations that decrease fibronectin deposition, such as transfection and overexpression of pp60c-src proto-oncogene in endothelial cells, reduce U937 cell adhesion. These results suggest that changes in endothelial cell extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition modulate, in part, the adhesive properties of the vessel wall after injury. In turn, the intensity and duration of mononuclear cell adhesion at sites of vessel wall injury determines, in part, the vessel wall response.","['Hauser, I A', 'Setter, E', 'Bell, L', 'Madri, J A']","['Hauser IA', 'Setter E', 'Bell L', 'Madri JA']","['Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/cytology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/chemistry/*cytology', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Integrins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/analysis/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/ultrastructure']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1993 Jul;143(1):173-80.,['R01-HL28373/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",,,['NEO<up>r</up>'],,PMC1886955,,,,,,,,,,

The pattern of beta 1 integrin expression on monoclonal B lineage cells from blood and bone marrow of myeloma patients was evaluated using multiparameter flow cytometry in comparison to normal blood or tissue B cells and malignant B cells from B-CLL, B lymphoma, or plasma cell leukemia. The alpha 4 and beta 1 chains were found on the majority of normal B cells, usually with a higher expression of alpha 4 compared to beta 1. alpha 5 was detectable at low density on B cells from lymph node, bone marrow, and lamina propria. the alpha 2 and alpha 6 chains are absent on B cells localized in normal lymphoid tissues as well as on normal blood B cells and in vitro activated B cells. In myeloma, the blood B cells express alpha 2, alpha 5, and alpha 6, suggesting important functional differences between these tumor-related B cells and their normal counterparts. The plasma cells located in myeloma bone marrow express no alpha 2, and almost no alpha 6, although they have variable expression of alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 1. Thus the end-stage plasma cells appear to lack receptors that would support a propensity for invasion of basement membranes and exit to extravascular spaces. In contrast, the circulating plasmablasts in a patient with plasma cell leukemia make up a large subset of early plasma cells expressing all integrin receptors analyzed, including alpha 2 and alpha 6. Malignant cells from B-CLL and B lymphoma express only the alpha 4 and beta 1 integrins, and some B-CLL have very low levels of alpha 3, but no alpha 2, alpha 5, or alpha 6, suggesting that they may be limited to the vascular spaces and do not extravasate, at least for the stages of disease analyzed here.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jensen, G S', 'Belch, A R', 'Mant, M J', 'Ruether, B A', 'Yacyshyn, B R', 'Pilarski, L M']","['Jensen GS', 'Belch AR', 'Mant MJ', 'Ruether BA', 'Yacyshyn BR', 'Pilarski LM']","['Department of Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/blood', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/*immunology/pathology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830430108 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1993 May;43(1):29-36. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830430108.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Integrins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied surface expression of certain VH and VK gene products on peripheral blood B lymphocytes from 23 patients with B-CLL, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) recognizing germline encoded cross-reactive idiotypes (CRI) associated with VHI (G6, G8), VHIII (B6, D12), VKIIIb (17-109) and an epitope linked to the VKIII light chain subgroup (C7). While only 1.7-3.2% of peripheral blood B lymphocytes from normal individuals expressed the VHI-associated CRI (VHI-CRI), these CRI were expressed on virtually all the leukaemic B cells from 17-22% of the CLL patients. The VHIII-associated CRI (VHIII-CRI), however, were found in 8.5-13% of the CLL B cells. Fifty per cent of the IgMK-expressing CLL cells (7/14) expressed the VKIII light chain subgroup of which only one expressed the VKIIIb-associated CRI (VKIIIb-CRI), 17-109. The anti-VHI-associated CRI antibodies were used to study their regulatory effect on in vitro Ig synthesis by the leukaemic cells. A significant suppression of spontaneous and mitogen-driven Ig production was observed in all cases studied. These results demonstrate an over-expression of VHI and VKIII gene products in B-CLL and suggest that B cells expressing these CRI are particularly susceptible to lymphoproliferative stimuli. The anti-CRI antibodies can be used to modulate Ig production by the leukaemic cells and may be of potential value for selective immunotherapy.","['Shokri, F', 'Mageed, R A', 'Richardson, P', 'Jefferis, R']","['Shokri F', 'Mageed RA', 'Richardson P', 'Jefferis R']","['Department of Immunology, Medical School, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Autoantibodies/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/chemistry/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cross Reactions', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/analysis/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteins/analysis']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb01682.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1993 Jun;37(6):673-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb01682.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enzyme immunoassay showed that hG-CSF was produced by primary bone marrow stromal cells, peripheral blood monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in vitro. These cells produced variable levels of hG-CSF depending on the type of inducers. Interestingly, in situ hybridization showed that only a small proportion of bone marrow stromal cells and blood monocytes expressed a large amount of hG-CSF mRNA. Secondly, we have estimated serum hG-CSF level and clearance of exogenous hG-CSF in patients with various hematological disorders. Endogenous hG-CSF was undetectable (< 30 pg/ml) in sera of normal volunteers. On the other hand, the serum hG-CSF level was elevated in infection, malignancy, and neutropenia, suggesting the presence of reactive, ectopic, and unknown mechanisms for hG-CSF production, respectively. The half-life of recombinant hG-CSF was prolonged in disorders with reduced myeloid cell mass, especially in aplastic anemia, whereas it was shortened in myeloid leukemia, and in recovery phase after chemotherapy. This finding suggests the possibility of receptor-mediated consumption of hG-CSF in vivo.

A high level of serum IFN-gamma was associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in a patient with hemophagocytic syndrome.

RBL-2H3 cells bound specifically to fibronectin-coated surfaces. Binding was maximal by 1 hour, was not detectable at 0 degrees C or in the absence of Ca++, and was inhibited by preincubating the cells with a synthetic peptide containing the RGD sequence. Adherence to fibronectin stimulated RBL-2H3 cell spreading with a concomitant reorganization of the cytoskeleton and a repositioning of the cytoplasmic granules to the cell periphery. Although adherence to fibronectin did not by itself induce histamine release, when stimulated by either immunologic or non-immunologic means, fibronectin-adherent cells released dramatically more histamine than cells plated in wells coated with BSA only. Thus, RBL-2H3 cells bind specifically to fibronectin, and in so doing are stimulated to undergo changes in morphology and enhanced responsiveness to secretory stimuli. RBL-2H3 cells grown in coculture with 3T3 fibroblasts, but not RBL-2H3 cells grown alone, became responsive to the polymeric synthetic secretagogue Compound 48/80 and the neuropeptide Substance P. Maximum sensitivity to Compound 48/80 was attained by the second week in coculture. Histamine release was dose-dependent, noncytotoxic and occurred even in the absence of extracellular Ca++. Contact between the 2 cell types appeared to be a critical factor.

Although many of these acute phase proteins are predominantly derived from the liver and the response can be elicited from liver cells incubated in tissue culture with cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-11 (IL-11), and oncostatin M, there is now evidence that the response can also be elicited in extrahepatic tissues and cell types. In this study, we show that many of the acute phase plasma proteins are expressed in human intestinal epithelial cell lines Caco2 and T84 and that their expression is induced or regulated by cytokines IL-6, IL-1, interferon, and tumor necrosis factor in a manner characteristic of the acute phase response. In fact, effects of IL-1 and IL-6 which are additive, synergistic, and antagonistic in liver cell lines are also observed in these intestinal epithelial cell lines. Responses to IL-6 and IL-1 are seen at all stages of differentiation of Caco2 cells from crypt-like enterocytes to villus-like enterocytes. Caco2 cells express binding sites for IL-6 at both poles, for IL-1 at the basolateral pole and, to a lesser extent, at the apical pole. T84 cells have IL-1 and IL-6 receptor binding sites only at the basolateral pole. IL-6 and IL-1 also regulate the expression of enterocyte-specific integral membrane proteins as exemplified by down-regulation of sucrase-isomaltase gene expression in response to IL-6. These data raise the possibility that enterocytes are involved in a local response to injury/inflammation at the epithelial surface and establish a model system for examining coordination of the acute phase response in a bipolar cell.","['Molmenti, E P', 'Ziambaras, T', 'Perlmutter, D H']","['Molmenti EP', 'Ziambaras T', 'Perlmutter DH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Complement Factor B/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Transferrin/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin/biosynthesis', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/biosynthesis']",1993/07/05 00:00,1993/07/05 00:01,['1993/07/05 00:00'],"['1993/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85216-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jul 5;268(19):14116-24.,"['DK45085/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD07409/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.4.21.47 (Complement Factor B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten short normal children were studied during their first year of treatment. Lymphocytes were collected at 0, 6 and 12 months of rhGH therapy, and we assessed the rate of spontaneous chromosome aberrations, the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges, the proliferative rate indices, the expression of common fragile sites induced by aphidicolin, and the sensitivity towards the radiomimetic action of bleomycin. At 6 months of therapy, there was a significant increase in bleomycin-induced chromosome aberrations, which remained unchanged after 1 year of treatment. An increase in spontaneous chromosome rearrangements at 6 and 12 months of therapy was also observed.

To determine whether this spontaneous colony formation is due to autocrine proliferation of MPD megakaryocyte progenitors or to hypersensitivity to Meg-CSF that might exist in the culture system, we investigated colony-forming unit-megakaryocytes (CFU-Meg) in the peripheral blood of 11 MPD patients, using serum-free cultures. Spontaneous megakaryocyte colonies were observed in serum-free cultures of nonadherent mononuclear cells (NAdMNC) obtained from MPD patients with thrombocytosis, whereas the NAdMNC of MPD patients without thrombocytosis, that of patients with reactive thrombocytosis and normal subjects never formed spontaneous colonies. However, the spontaneous colonies from MPD patients with thrombocytosis disappeared in cultures using highly purified CD34-positive cells as target cells. To study the hypersensitivity of megakaryocyte progenitors to Meg-CSF, dose-response experiments were performed with interleukin-3 (IL-3). CFU-Meg from MPD patients with thrombocytosis showed maximal growth at the concentrations of IL-3 lower than those for normal subjects. CFU-Meg of MPD patients without thrombocytosis and that of patients with reactive thrombocytosis showed the same colony growth response to IL-3 as that of normal subjects. This result indicates that the CFU-Meg of MPD patients with thrombocytosis are hypersensitive to IL-3. It also suggests that spontaneous colony formation by NAdMNC is not due to the autocrine growth of megakaryocyte progenitors but is due to the hypersensitivity of megakaryocyte progenitors to Meg-CSF, such as IL-3, released by accessory cells. Furthermore, it is possible that such hypersensitivity of CFU-Meg to IL-3 might be a pathogenic factor in MPD with accompanying thrombocytosis.","['Kobayashi, S', 'Teramura, M', 'Hoshino, S', 'Motoji, T', 'Oshimi, K', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Kobayashi S', 'Teramura M', 'Hoshino S', 'Motoji T', 'Oshimi K', 'Mizoguchi H']","[""Department of Haematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood', 'Thrombocytosis/blood']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04688.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Apr;83(4):539-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04688.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It relies on (a) electrostatic cell attachment to poly-L-lysine-coated multispot slides, (b) sequential use of glutaraldehyde fixation and detergent permeabilization, and (c) staining of endogenous peroxidases and antigens in contrasting colors. Differential staining instead of inactivation of endogenous peroxidases and avoidance of artifacts incurred in conventional cytocentrifugation, dehydration, and alcohol or acetone fixation uniquely afforded improved precision in cell identification, clear distinction of cytoplasmic from surface antigenic staining, and greatly enhanced sensitivity in antigen detection, all combined with increased performance efficiency achieved by the use of multispot slides. With this method, cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and CD3 were found more widely distributed than has been previously recognized. Thus, almost all malignant cells in all cases of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (encompassing the major subtypes) and T-ALL, as well as substantial proportions of benign mature B- and T-lymphocytes, stained strongly positive for cIg and cCD3, respectively, whereas myeloid cells were consistently negative. High sensitivity combined with excellent cytomorphology and differential myeloperoxidase staining permitted unequivocal differentiation of minute fractions of malignant cells against a heterogeneous background of benign cells.","['Kranz, B R', 'Thierfelder, S']","['Kranz BR', 'Thierfelder S']","['Institut fur Immunologie, GS-Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulins/*analysis', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Peroxidases/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staining and Labeling', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/41.7.7685787 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1993 Jul;41(7):1003-11. doi: 10.1177/41.7.7685787.,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML-193 cells require GM-CSF and G-CSF(CSFs) for optimum growth, and 24 h deprivation of CSFs decreased DNA synthesis measured in terms of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The DNA synthesis gradually recovered upon addition of CSFs. To examine the sensitivity to ara-C under different growth conditions, two groups of cell suspensions, one pretreated with CSFs after 24 h deprivation (CSFs(+) cells), and the other held continuously under CSFs-free conditions (CSFs(-) cells), were exposed to 1.0 microgram/ml of ara-C for 16 h. In clonogenic assays, CSFs(+) cells showed higher sensitivity to ara-C than CSFs(-) cells. These cell groups showed no significant difference in ara-C triphosphate accumulation or retention, though the amount of ara-C incorporated into the acid-insoluble fraction was two times greater in CSFs(+) cells than CSFs(-) cells, and that difference became even clearer in the retention pools. These data suggest that the enhancement of cytotoxicity by CSFs was due to the promotion of ara-C incorporation into DNA as a result of an increase of the cell fraction in the S phase.","['Takauji, R', 'Tohyama, K', 'Ueda, T', 'Nakamura, T']","['Takauji R', 'Tohyama K', 'Ueda T', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/metabolism/toxicity', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb00156.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1993 Apr;84(4):445-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb00156.x.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,PMC5919314,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the hyperleukocytosis, we examined effects of some growth-promoting cytokines on proliferation of RA-treated APL cells in primary culture. Effect of negative regulators was also examined. These results indicate that proliferation of APL cells is greatly modulated by several cytokines even in the presence of RA. Enhanced RA-induced differentiation, when used in combination with other agents, has been shown with several cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interferon alpha.

A cold two-step method of RNA isolation was devised which provides high yields of full-length RNA templates from these tissues and eliminates the discolored contaminant. Immediately following homogenization of tissues at ca. 5 degrees C, which proved crucial for the recovery of high-molecular weight species, the RNA is isolated from the bulk of the RNase by a single acid-phenol-chloroform extraction at 0 degrees C. The inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, suspected to be a proteoglycan (or a similar high-molecular-weight polyanion) component of the intestinal mucus, is eliminated only by a second purification step employing ultracentrifugation through a dense cushion of CsCl.

Therapeutic value in oncology].,585-90,"Among haematopoietic growth factors, the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and, more recently, interleukin-3 have been used in therapeutics mainly to try to reduce the duration of aplasia after chemotherapy followed or not by bone marrow transplantation in solid tumours and in leukaemias. In addition, interleukin-3 reduces the need for red cell and platelet transfusions. A concomitant reduction of death from infection, antibiotic use and duration of stay in hospital has been demonstrated by some randomized studies, but data are lacking to evaluate its practical and economic value. In acute myeloid leukaemia haematopoietic growth factors sensitize leukaemic cells to chemotherapy in vitro, but the clinical usefulness of this finding remains to be assessed. The stimulating and differentiating actions of haematopoietic growth factors on the bone marrow in vitro seems to have a clinical value in myelodysplastic syndromes where randomized studies have shown a rise in the number of cells after administration of these factors. However, whether long-term treatment will prolong the survival of patients with myeloplastic syndromes remains to be demonstrated.","['Archimbaud, E', 'Fiere, D']","['Archimbaud E', 'Fiere D']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1993/04/03 00:00,1993/04/03 00:01,['1993/04/03 00:00'],"['1993/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1993 Apr 3;22(12):585-90.,,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",61,,,,,,,Facteurs de croissance hematopoietiques.

A variety of drugs have been shown to inhibit the function of this pump, including compounds known to block various ion channels. The mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y has been transduced with the human mdrI gene. Using this cell line, we have tested a number of compounds to determine whether there is a correlation between the ability to block a specific type of ion channel, or shift membrane potential, and the ability to act as an MDR-reversing agent using the fluorescent substrates Rhodamine 123 and daunorubicin as test compounds. Our results show no apparent correlation between the ability to block a specific ion channel and reversal of MDR transport ability. We have found active MDR inhibitors in compounds that affect K+, Na+, Ca++, H+, but not Cl- channels. Our data suggest that Cl- channel activity may be distinct from MDR activity. Several immunosuppressive compounds and analogs were also tested and found to be active reversing agents. Measurements suggest a significant difference in resting membrane potential between the L5178YvMDR line and the L5178Y parental cell line used in these experiments. No correlation was found between the ability of drugs to alter membrane potential and to inhibit MDR transport activity. Our results suggest that MDR transport function may be independent of the physiological movement of ions and show that a wide variety of compounds can inhibit MDR transport.","['Weaver, J L', 'Szabo, G Jr', 'Pine, P S', 'Gottesman, M M', 'Goldenberg, S', 'Aszalos, A']","['Weaver JL', 'Szabo G Jr', 'Pine PS', 'Gottesman MM', 'Goldenberg S', 'Aszalos A']","['Division of Research and Testing, Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC 20204.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Benzofurans/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/chemistry', 'Ion Channels/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Potassium', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/28 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/05/28 00:00'],"['1993/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910540317 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 May 28;54(3):456-61. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910540317.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,['mdr1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells with a CD7+ CD4- CD8- phenotype are demonstrated to originate from malignant pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. In this article, the authors describe three rare cases, designated as a lymphoma type of CD7+ stem cell leukemia/lymphoma, with clinical features described below. All three patients were admitted with non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a 2-month to 4-month history of lymphadenopathy. Histologic examination of lymph nodes showed lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in all patients. Bone marrow blast cells had an immunophenotype consistent with CD7+ CD4- CD8- acute leukemia, although abnormal cells were not observed in the peripheral blood during the course of the disease. One patient had a recurrence in the bone marrow, with myeloperoxidase-positive blast cells expressing myeloid differentiation antigens. Chromosomal analysis detected a common abnormal karyotype initially and at relapse. Furthermore, the same T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was found initially and at relapse, suggesting that these blast cells originated from the same pluripotent leukemic clone.

A review.,5-16,"BACKGROUND: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic B-cell malignancy, typically seen in middle-aged men, characterized by pancytopenia, splenomegaly, immunologic abnormalities, and morphologically typical neoplastic mononuclear cells in the blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and other tissues. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of hairy cells in biopsy specimens from the bone marrow or spleen or in peripheral blood. The natural history of this lymphoproliferative disorder varies. Patients may die early during the initial phase of therapy; others may require no therapy; and for some, splenectomy alone, without further treatment, may suffice for many years. Recently, the nucleosides pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin) (DCF) and 2'-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) have been shown to produce greater numbers of durable complete remissions with curative potential in patients with HCL. The treatment options, with emphasis on major therapeutic advances with alpha-interferon, DCF, and 2-CdA, are reviewed in this article. METHODS: Studies on HCL published from 1958 to 1992 were reviewed using the Cancerline and Medline retrieval systems and other bibliographies. RESULTS: Management of HCL has changed in the last decade as a result of three new effective agents: alpha-interferon DCF, and 2-CdA. DCF has produced an overall response rate of 86% and a complete remission rate of 62%. 2-CdA has yielded an overall response rate of 95% and a complete remission rate of 82%. Alpha-interferon has given an overall response rate of 82% and a complete remission rate of 8%. Other agents with limited activities include chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vincristine, doxorubicin, and zorubicin hydrochloride. The effects of lithium carbonate, immunotherapy, splenic irradiation, androgens, and leukaphoresis are minimal and transient. CONCLUSIONS: Modern management of HCL with 2-CdA and DCF is now potentially curative rather than palliative in some patients; however, the optimal therapeutic approach remains uncertain. Alpha-interferon has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as the first-line drug therapy, followed by DCF in non-responding patients. 2-CdA remains an experimental therapy, but its higher response rate and ease of administration may make it the first-line treatment of choice. Additional research into the biology of HCL and further clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy for this disorder. Therefore, the best therapeutic approach at the current time is to include patients with HCL in ongoing clinical trials.","['Jaiyesimi, I A', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Estey, E H']","['Jaiyesimi IA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Deoxyadenosines/therapeutic use', 'Forecasting', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Splenectomy', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<5::aid-cncr2820720104>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jul 1;72(1):5-16. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<5::aid-cncr2820720104>3.0.co;2-y.,,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)"", 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the Stanford results according to prognostic indices.,4034-42,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy and toxicity of the MA-COP-B regimen were assessed after outstanding results were reported in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) by the Vancouver group. The results are reported according to several proposed prognostic indices, including the recent International Prognostic Factors (IPF) Project. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with untreated DLCL received MACOP-B chemotherapy. Thirty patients, most of whom had bulky disease, also received consolidative radiation therapy (RT). Patient characteristics include median age of 42 years, Stage III/IV (57%), bulky or symptomatic Stage II disease (43%), elevated lactic dehydrogenase (81%) and at least one extranodal site (72%). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 3.3 years, overall survival was 57% and freedom from progression (FFP) was 52%. The 3-year FFP data were related to tumor extent: 74% for limited stage versus 38% for extensive disease. These data correlated well with four prognostic indices reported in the literature. The IPF index accurately identified low-, intermediate-, and high-risk subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with limited or low-risk DLCL have an excellent prognosis with MACOP-B +/- RT. These results do not support the use of consolidative high-dose therapy and bone marrow transplantation in patients with limited disease, even if bulky or accompanied by an elevated lactic dehydrogenase. Compared to historical CHOP data, MACOP-B +/- RT does not appear to improve outcome for those patients with poor prognostic features, most of whom will fail. The IPF index is a simple, accurate method of distinguishing high-risk patients who require new therapeutic initiatives.","['Bartlett, N L', 'Kwak, L W', 'Horning, S J']","['Bartlett NL', 'Kwak LW', 'Horning SJ']","['Division of Oncology, Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, California 94304-1808.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930615)71:12<4034::aid-cncr2820711238>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jun 15;71(12):4034-42. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930615)71:12<4034::aid-cncr2820711238>3.0.co;2-b.,,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'MACOP-B protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pro-inflammatory systemically active cytokines are produced within the joint, found in the serum and are capable of inducing the hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins. Initially it was believed that the acute-phase response was elicited by the cytokine, interleukin-1 alone. However, it is now clear that there is a complex interaction between the cytokines with interleukin-6 predominant, but also involving interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor and a group of recently described cytokines including interleukin-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M all of which influence the levels of acute-phase proteins. In clinical practice CRP is frequently used as a marker of the acute-phase response. It has a short half-life and consequently is a sensitive measure of cytokine-induced protein synthesis. The rate of appearance of bony erosions early in disease correlates with the mean serum concentration of CRP in some studies. It has been suggested that a weak correlation probably reflects the fact that joints in which erosions most frequently occur, namely the small joints of the hand, produce smaller amounts of cytokine than the large joints such as the knee. A recent study examining the rate of spinal trabecular bone loss in the first year of rheumatoid disease found a strong correlation between bone loss and serum CRP concentrations. It appears that CRP concentrations reflect the level of 'systemic osteoclast-activating factor' and are, therefore, a good measure of the general catabolic state of the patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Emery, P', 'Luqmani, R']","['Emery P', 'Luqmani R']","['Department of Rheumatology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Rheumatol,British journal of rheumatology,8302415,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/analysis/classification', 'Acute-Phase Reaction', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/etiology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Resorption', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/rheumatology/32.suppl_3.3 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Rheumatol. 1993 Jun;32 Suppl 3:3-8. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/32.suppl_3.3.,,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphologic and cytochemical features of the leukemic cells from all these patients corresponded well to those of de novo AML, and they were diagnosed with MDS-AML. Phenotypically, the frequent expression of the lymphocyte activation antigens, CD25 and CD30, was characteristic in MDS-AML. The in vitro response of MDS-AML cells to various growth factors was similar to that of de novo AML cells. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) suppressed growth factor-dependent colony formation by normal bone marrow cells, MDS bone marrow cells, and de novo AML cells, but did not inhibit colony formation by MDS-AML cells. The number of TGF beta 1 high-affinity binding sites of MDS-AML samples (< 5 to 47 sites/cell) was markedly lower than that in de novo AML samples (120 to 221 sites/cell).

The cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline made with deuterium oxide solvent. A significant fraction of the emission occurring 10-80 microseconds after the laser pulse was due to singlet oxygen. This singlet-oxygen emission is believed to result from singlet oxygen generated near the cell-membrane surface, where 5-(N-hexadecanoyl)amino eosin is known to concentrate, and then diffusing out into the buffer. The intensity and the kinetics of the experimentally observed singlet-oxygen emission were in excellent agreement with the predictions of a theoretical one-dimensional model of singlet-oxygen diffusion and quenching. During the 10-80 microseconds time period studied, most of the singlet oxygen was located in the buffer. Thus, the use of water-soluble singlet-oxygen quenchers, such as histidine, provide one means of separating the singlet-oxygen emission from other sources of light during this time interval.","['Baker, A', 'Kanofsky, J R']","['Baker A', 'Kanofsky JR']","['Research Service, Edward Hines, Jr., Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital, Hines, IL 60141.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Carnosine/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Eosine Yellowish-(YS)/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Histidine/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Photochemistry', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1993.tb02944.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1993 Apr;57(4):720-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1993.tb02944.x.,,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '114586-25-3 (5-(N-hexadecanoyl)aminoeosin)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '8HO6PVN24W (Carnosine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'TDQ283MPCW (Eosine Yellowish-(YS))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Either 30S subunits or S4 protein bound to the mRNA causes Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase to pause near the 3' terminus of the pseudoknot. There is no competition between subunits and S4 for mRNA binding. The kinetics of forming S4-30S-mRNA complexes are biphasic, and the fraction of mRNA molecules reacting more rapidly decreases as the temperature is increased from 30 degrees C to 40 degrees C. The complex cannot be detected with mRNA mutants that cannot be repressed. We have previously shown similar kinetic behavior for the formation of tRNA(fMet) initiation complexes with tRNA(fMet), 30S subunits, and mRNA, except that the fraction reacting rapidly increases when the temperature is increased over the same 30-40 degrees C range. Thus the two sets of experiments show that there are two forms of 30S-mRNA complexes that differ in their abilities to bind S4 and tRNA(fMet). The results support an allosteric model for translational repression in which S4 traps the mRNA in a conformation able to bind 30S subunits but unable to form an initiation complex with tRNA(fMet).","['Spedding, G', 'Draper, D E']","['Spedding G', 'Draper DE']","['Department of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Operon', '*Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'RNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Met/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Temperature']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.10.4399 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 May 15;90(10):4399-403. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.10.4399.,['GM29048/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Met)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein S4)']",,,,,PMC46518,,,,,,,,,,

This binding was postulated to stabilize a pseudoknot structure that exists in equilibrium with two stem-loops. Here, we use ""toeprint"" experiments with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase to analyze the effect of S15 on the formation of the ternary mRNA-30S-tRNA(fMet) complex. We show that the binding of the 30S subunit on the mRNA stops reverse transcriptase near position +10, corresponding to the 3' terminus of the pseudoknot, most likely by stabilizing the pseudoknot conformation. Furthermore, S15 is found to stabilize the binary 30S-mRNA complex. When the ternary 30S-mRNA-tRNA(fMet) complex is formed, a toeprint is observed at position +17. This toeprint progressively disappears when the ternary complex is formed in the presence of increasing concentrations of S15, while a shift from position +17 to position +10 is observed. Beside, RNase T1 footprinting experiments reveal the simultaneous binding of S15 and 30S subunit on the mRNA. Otherwise, we show by filter binding assays that initiator tRNA remains bound to the 30S subunit even in the presence of S15. Our results indicate that S15 prevents the formation of a functional ternary 30S-mRNA-tRNA(fMet) complex, the ribosome being trapped in a preternary 30S-mRNA-tRNA(fMet) complex.","['Philippe, C', 'Eyermann, F', 'Benard, L', 'Portier, C', 'Ehresmann, B', 'Ehresmann, C']","['Philippe C', 'Eyermann F', 'Benard L', 'Portier C', 'Ehresmann B', 'Ehresmann C']","['Unite Propre de Recherche 9002 du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Operator Regions, Genetic', '*Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'RNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer, Met/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.10.4394 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 May 15;90(10):4394-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.10.4394.,,"['0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Met)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein S15)']",,,,,PMC46517,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the wild type, an RNase H-minus RT missing the entire RNase H domain and two other mutants having abnormal polymerase:RNase H ratios were expressed. These mutants include (i) a chimeric protein in which the MuLV RNase H domain was replaced by the entire Escherichia coli RNase H sequence and (ii) an RT with a 126 amino acid deletion in a region analogous to the ""connection"" subdomain in the p66 subunit of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT (Kohlstaedt, L. A., Wang, J., Friedman, J. M., Rice, P. A., & Steitz, T. A. (1992) Science 256, 1783-1790). With the wild-type RT, the major RNase H cleavage reaction was coordinated with DNA synthesis and occurred at a position corresponding to 15 nucleotides from the 3'-terminus of the DNA primer. Additional cleavages closer to the 5'-end of the RNA were explained in terms of a model relating binding of the RNA.DNA hybrid substrate and enzyme structure. The chimeric RT behaved like E. coli RNase H, exhibited 300-fold higher RNase H activity than wild-type RT, and was limited in its ability to synthesize DNA. Qualitative and quantitative changes in the polymerase and RNase H activities of the deletion mutant were also observed. The RNase H domain appeared to function independently of the polymerase domain, supporting the idea that the proper spatial relationship between the two active centers was disrupted by the mutation. Taken together, our results indicate that alteration of the normal polymerase:RNase H ratio can have profound effects on both polymerase and RNase H cleavage activities, as expected for an enzyme with two interdependent domains.","['Post, K', 'Guo, J', 'Kalman, E', 'Uchida, T', 'Crouch, R J', 'Levin, J G']","['Post K', 'Guo J', 'Kalman E', 'Uchida T', 'Crouch RJ', 'Levin JG']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids', 'Poly A/chemistry/metabolism', 'Poly T/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Sequence Deletion']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00072a004 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Jun 1;32(21):5508-17. doi: 10.1021/bi00072a004.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '25086-81-1 (Poly T)', '27156-07-6 (poly A-T)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibody-coated magnetic microspheres (dynabeads) can be used to isolate these cells by positive selection procedures. However, the advantages of using dynabeads in some positive selection protocols are compromised by the retention of the beads on the cells. We present a protocol which allows the rapid chemical release of the beads from positively sorted cells. The murine immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 CD34 antibody, QBEND/10, was immobilised onto dynabeads as part of a three-layered immune complex: QBEND/10 was attached to F(ab')2 anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody fragments, which were immunologically bound to a mouse IgG1 myeloma protein. The myeloma protein covalently bonded the triplex to the beads. Thus, disulphide bonds in the hinge region of the F(ab')2 could be reduced with 10 microM dithiothreitol and CD34+ cells released within 20 min. Purified cells can be re-phenotyped by multiple markers and subsets identified. Purity of 97%, recovery of > 50%, and viability over 90% of the CD34+ cells was readily achieved.

Because CTCL cells were previously shown to be CD7-, we looked at expression of these receptors on the CD7- T-cell subset as well as on total T cells. Our results indicate that CTCL patients have increased levels of both CLA+ and CD7- cells in their peripheral blood and that these abnormalities are not seen in patients with other cutaneous disorders. The levels of the CLA-bearing subset correlated with extent of cutaneous but not lymph node disease. By contrast, the CD7- L-selectin+ subset correlated with peripheral lymph node involvement by CTCL. Only the CD7- L-selectin- subset correlated with the number of morphologically abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.

NZB mice, as they age, develop clones of B-1 cells with the majority of the clones possessing extra chromosomes (hyperdiploid). These clones differ in growth characteristics, varying from a slow-growing non-invasive clonal expansion of B-1 cells, similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), to an aggressive fast-growing invasive malignancy, similar to Richter's syndrome. Apoptosis was induced in cultures of B-1 cells purified from peritoneal wash-out cells with either anti-immunoglobulin (anti-IgM) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The malignant hyperdiploid B-1 cells had increased apoptosis in response to these stimuli as determined by the presence of fragmented DNA. The amount of apoptosis was directly related to the aggressive nature of the B-1 cells. The increased apoptosis observed in malignant B-1 cells was also correlated with the state of activation of the cells. Malignant B-1 cells undergoing high levels of apoptosis had high spontaneous activation and IgM production. The supernatant levels of IgM in unstimulated cultures of aggressive malignant B-1 cells were the same as that stimulated with LPS, indicating that the malignant B-1 clones were maximally activated in vivo. In conclusion, hyperdiploid B-1 cells appear to have altered responses to stimuli that normally activate mature B cells. A signal for apoptosis rather than stimulation may result when malignant B-1 clones have their antigen receptors engaged. The increased apoptosis capability of malignant B-1 cells may be exploited as a therapeutic tool.","['Peng, B', 'Raveche, E']","['Peng B', 'Raveche E']","['Department of Pathology, UMDNJ/New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jun;7(6):789-94.,['AI-29740/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using immunohistochemistry, we have studied the molecular bases of this process in seven skin biopsies involved by mycosis fungoides (MF) and in 12 tonsils, four involved by B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and eight by lymphoid follicular hyperplasia (LH). In the skin, intraepidermal T-lymphocyte infiltration was associated with narrowing and fragmentation of the basement membrane, as shown by an anti-collagen type IV antibody. Immunostaining of serial sections with an anti-collagenase type IV antibody revealed that collagenase type IV was localized in the upper dermis and strictly co-distributed with collagen type IV, suggesting that enzymatic digestion played a role in the alterations of the basement membrane. Further migration through the epidermis was mediated by expression on keratinocytes of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and of leukocyte-function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on infiltrating lymphocytes. In the tonsil, intraepithelial infiltration was mediated by the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) by epithelial cells and of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) by infiltrating lymphocytes. Further intraepithelial lymphocyte migration was then established, as already shown in the skin, by ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction. Lymphocyte recruitment from the systemic circulation was studied using antibodies directed against endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. These adhesion molecules were highly expressed by blood vessels in the upper dermis of MF and the percentage of ELAM-1+/VCAM-1+ vessels was significantly higher than that observed in tonsils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Uccini, S', 'Ruco, L P', 'Monardo, F', 'La Parola, I L', 'Cerimele, D', 'Baroni, C D']","['Uccini S', 'Ruco LP', 'Monardo F', 'La Parola IL', 'Cerimele D', 'Baroni CD']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,IM,"['Basement Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*immunology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil/*immunology', 'Skin/*immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1711690405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 1993 Apr;169(4):413-9. doi: 10.1002/path.1711690405.,,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies we have shown that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) raises substance P (SP) and the mRNA coding for its preprotachykinin precursor in cultured sympathetic superior cervical ganglia (SCG) (Jonakait and Schotland, 1990; Hart et al., 1991a). The action of IL-1 is blocked both by depolarization of the ganglia and by glucocorticoid hormones (Hart et al., 1991a). In the present report, we have found that IL-1 does not act directly upon neurons to raise SP, but rather induces the production of a soluble intermediate molecule that raises both SP and the cholinergic-specific enzyme ChAT. Its induction by IL-1 is blocked by the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone; its action is compromised under depolarizing conditions. Because medium conditioned by IL-1 (IL-1CM) is functionally similar to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), we sought to determine whether this molecule might be an active constituent of IL-1CM. Immunoprecipitation with an antiserum directed against LIF eliminated large proportions of SP-inducing activity from IL-1CM. In addition, steady-state levels of mRNA coding for LIF are increased by IL-1 treatment of SCG. These data suggest that LIF, induced by IL-1, may ultimately be responsible for the IL-1 induction of SP.","['Shadiack, A M', 'Hart, R P', 'Carlson, C D', 'Jonakait, G M']","['Shadiack AM', 'Hart RP', 'Carlson CD', 'Jonakait GM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/cytology/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Substance P/*metabolism', 'Veratrine/pharmacology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1993 Jun;13(6):2601-9.,"['MH-00855/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 07059-24/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)', 'ERQ7M6C50B (Veratrine)']",,,,,PMC6576489,,,,,,,,,,

Local estrogen production was also suggested to be important in the development of endometrial cancer; however, the presence or absence of aromatase enzyme activity in normal human endometrium is controversial. To address this issue, we used a sensitive technique capable of detecting mRNA transcripts present in only very low copy number. The polymerase chain reaction linked to reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate the presence or absence of aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom) transcripts in endometrial tissues (n = 7) and endometrial stromal cells (n = 9) under various culture conditions. RNA was isolated from four proliferative and three secretory tissue samples and from cultured endometrial stromal cells isolated from seven proliferative and two secretory endometria. Five sets of cultures were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), estradiol (E2), and forskolin. Additionally, RNA was isolated from decidualized endometrium obtained from a patient with tubal pregnancy. A single stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a P450arom-specific oligonucleotide. The single stranded cDNA was used as a template for PCR and was amplified for 20-35 cycles using P450arom-specific primers. RNA from adipose tissue and placenta was amplified to provide positive controls, whereas myometrial RNA was used as a negative control. In two experiments involving two endometrial tissues and three sets of cells in culture, a rat P450arom cRNA was coamplified in each sample as an internal control to demonstrate that the remote possibility of RT-PCR failures in individual test samples cannot account for our negative results. By Southern or slot blot hybridization of the amplified fragments using human and rat P450arom-specific probes, we found no evidence for the presence of P450arom transcripts in normal endometrium, decidualized endometrium, or endometrial stromal cells in culture. In our hands, assay of aromatase activity using [3H]water release from [3H]androstenedione by endometrial stromal cells in culture treated with MPA and E2, did not reveal any detectable aromatase activity. The same cells responded to MPA plus E2 treatment by a significant increase in PRL secretion into the culture medium. Presently, RT-PCR is the most sensitive method available for the detection of specific mRNA species in low copy numbers. These findings are indicative of the absence of P450arom transcripts in normal human endometrium.","['Bulun, S E', 'Mahendroo, M S', 'Simpson, E R']","['Bulun SE', 'Mahendroo MS', 'Simpson ER']","['Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9051.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Aromatase/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Decidua/metabolism/*physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.76.6.7684741 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1993 Jun;76(6):1458-63. doi: 10.1210/jcem.76.6.7684741.,"['5-T32-HD-07190/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'AG-08174/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ligand for c-kit, steel factor (SLF), encoded by the steel (Sl) locus, is produced as both membrane-bound and soluble forms by fibroblastoid cells. Fibroblasts derived from normal (+/+) WCB6F1 mice are known to produce both forms of SLF and were able to support FDC-P1 cells in a contact-dependent manner in the presence of neutralizing anti-GM-CSF antiserum. In contrast, Sl/Sld mutant fibroblasts, which produce only a soluble form of SLF, were incapable of supporting FDC-P1 cells in the presence of GM-CSF antiserum. These results suggested that FDC-P1 cells were being supported on fibroblast layers by membrane-bound SLF. Attempts to grow FDC-P1 cells in high levels of soluble recombinant SLF to mimic the SLF-dependent response seen in co-culture experiments showed that cells which had been previously grown in GM-CSF or IL-3 were minimally responsive to SLF at concentrations up to 100 ng/mL. Although these cultures were not supported by SLF alone, the cells showed synergistic proliferative responses to SLF combined with suboptimal levels of GM-CSF or IL-3. FDC-P1 cells could, however, be adapted to grow in SLF alone by gradual substitution of SLF for GM-CSF over a period of 3 weeks. These cells showed 5.6- to 8.4-fold and 2.5-fold higher levels of c-kit mRNA than cells grown in GM-CSF or IL-3, respectively. Downregulation of surface c-kit protein was also seen in FDC-P1 cells grown in GM-CSF or IL-3 compared with cells grown in SLF. Although FDC-P1 cells propagated in SLF were more responsive to SLF, they were still able to proliferate as well in GM-CSF and IL-3 as the cells originally grown in the latter factors. Thus, functional downregulation of c-kit by GM-CSF and IL-3 was unidirectional.","['Caruana, G', 'Ashman, L K', 'Fujita, J', 'Gonda, T J']","['Caruana G', 'Ashman LK', 'Fujita J', 'Gonda TJ']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Jun;21(6):761-8.,,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This carbohydrate epitope is formed by the sequential action of alpha 3-sialyltransferase and alpha 3-fucosyltransferase on N-acetyllactosamine (Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc) disaccharide termini of glycoconjugates. We have addressed the role of the human myeloid alpha 3-fucosyltransferase in the expression of this epitope at the leucocyte surface by determining its activity in human-mouse leukemic cell hybrids (WEGLI), normal human granulocytes and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells using sialylated and desialylated glycoproteins and oligosaccharides as acceptor substrates. In contrast to what has been reported for the myeloid-type enzyme, we found that the alpha 3-fucosyltransferase of the cells studied can use sialylated acceptors be it that the activity is several times lower than with asialo-substrates. Characterization of the product obtained with a sialylated oligosaccharide indicated that the enzyme can catalyze the formation of the sialyl-Le(x) structure. Flow cytometry of the WEGLI cells using a sialyl-Le(x)-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) showed that these cells indeed express sialyl-Lex at their surface, provided that they contain human chromosome 11. Earlier the presence of this chromosome had been correlated with the expression of alpha 3-fucosyltransferase activity. In addition to sialyl-Le(x), WEGLI cells containing chromosome 11 showed high-expression levels of related structures recognized by antibodies VIM-2 and VIM-8, suggesting that fucose addition can occur at both distal and proximal GlcNAc residues in poly-N-acetyl-lactosaminoglycan sequences. Based on the human chromosome contents it could be ruled out that the alpha 3-fucosyltransferase of WEGLI cells is a Lewis-type alpha 3/4- or plasma-type alpha 3-fucosyltransferase, the genes of which have been mapped to chromosome 19. It is concluded that the enzyme studied is of the myeloid-type and indeed is involved in the synthesis of sialyl-Le(x) (and also VIM-2 and VIM-8 structures) in leukocytes provided that its expression is at a sufficiently high level.","['Easton, E W', 'Schiphorst, W E', 'van Drunen, E', 'van der Schoot, C E', 'van den Eijnden, D H']","['Easton EW', 'Schiphorst WE', 'van Drunen E', 'van der Schoot CE', 'van den Eijnden DH']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/*metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'E-Selectin', 'Fucosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes/enzymology/*immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'P-Selectin', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71539-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 1;81(11):2978-86.,,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of ATL cells with anti-APO-1 in vitro inhibited spontaneous and cytokine-mediated DNA synthesis. Furthermore, DNA isolated from cells treated with anti-APO-1 exhibited polynucleosomal DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder) characteristic for apoptotic cell death.

We localized the LAM-, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, and TNF-alpha-inducible promoter activity to a -131/+15 (positions -131 to +15) DNA fragment of the IL-1 beta gene by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Within this DNA fragment, there were two novel 9-bp motifs (-90/-82 and -40/-32) with high homology to the nuclear factor-IL6 (NF-IL6) binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the two NF-IL-6 motifs could be independently activated by LAM, LPS, or TNF-alpha and that they acted in an orientation-independent manner.

Jane, P.A. Ney, E.F. Vanin, D.L. Gumucio, and A.W. Nienhuis. EMBO J. 11:2691-2699, 1992). The element binds two proteins, the ubiquitous activator Sp1 and a protein previously known as -50 gamma and now named the stage selector protein (SSP). Binding of the second protein correlates with SSE activity in transient-transfection assays. We now report that a de novo binding site for the SSP is created by the -202(C-->G) mutation that causes hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). This site functions in an analogous manner to the SSE in hybrid beta-promoter/reporter gene constructs transfected into K562 cells. In contrast, the wild-type -202 sequence, which fails to bind the SSP, is incapable of activating the beta-gene promoter. Both the -50 and -202 HPFH sites for SSP binding overlap a consensus sequence for the transcriptional regulator Sp1. In addition, both sites contain CpG dinucleotides that are contact bases for SSP. Since the gamma promoter is known to be hypomethylated in fetal cells but fully methylated at CpG residues in adult erythroid cells, we examined the effects of this DNA modification on protein binding to the two regions. Gel mobility shift assays with nuclear extract from K562 cells (which contain both Sp1 and SSP) demonstrate preferential binding of SSP to the SSE and HPFH sites under conditions in which probe was limiting. Methylation of the CpG residues reverses this preference only in the SSE site, with a marked increase in the binding of Sp1 at the expense of the SSP. Purified Sp1 binds with 10-fold higher affinity to the methylated than to the nonmethylated -50 probe but with the same affinity to the -202 HPFH probe. The methylation-induced preferential binding of Sp1 to the SSE at the expense of SSP may be part of the mechanism by which the gamma genes are repressed in normal adult erythroid cells. In cells containing the -202 HPFH mutation, the inability of Sp1 to displace SSP in the methylated state may explain the persistence of gamma-promoter activity and gamma-gene expression observed in adults with this mutation.","['Jane, S M', 'Gumucio, D L', 'Ney, P A', 'Cunningham, J M', 'Nienhuis, A W']","['Jane SM', 'Gumucio DL', 'Ney PA', 'Cunningham JM', 'Nienhuis AW']","['National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Adult', 'Aging/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.6.3272-3281.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Jun;13(6):3272-81. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.6.3272-3281.1993.,,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",,,,,PMC359778,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, both fixed and irradiated HTLV-I-producing T-cell lines induced proliferation of PBLs; HOS/PL cells did not activate PBLs. Second, HTLV-I-positive T-cell lines were capable of activating interleukin-2 mRNA expression in Jurkat cells. Induction of interleukin-2 expression was inhibited by anti-CD2 and anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3) monoclonal antibodies but not anti-human leukocyte antigen-DR, anti-CD4, anti-LFA-1, or anti-intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Similar results were obtained with PBLs as the responder cells. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies and antisera against various regions of the HTLV-I envelope proteins gp46 and gp21 as well as p40tax did not block activation. These data indicate that HTLV-I viral particles are not intrinsically mitogenic and that infection of target T cells is not necessary for activation. Instead, the mitogenic activity is restricted to virus-producing T cells, requires cell-to-cell contact, and may be mediated through the LFA-3/CD2 activation pathway.","['Kimata, J T', 'Palker, T J', 'Ratner, L']","['Kimata JT', 'Palker TJ', 'Ratner L']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.6.3134-3141.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jun;67(6):3134-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.6.3134-3141.1993.,['T32HL07088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,,,,PMC237651,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of leukocytes with this antibody induced a vigorous homotypic aggregation that had similar physiologic conditions as aggregation induced by a monoclonal antibody specific for the alpha 4 subunit. Expression of a beta 1 subunit on the cell surface was not sufficient for mAb 33B6-mediated aggregation to occur, since cells of the K562 erythroleukemia line failed to respond even though they expressed the beta 1 subunit and the 33B6 epitope. However, after transfection with cDNA encoding the alpha 4 subunit, K562 cells acquired the ability to aggregate in response to mAb 33B6 binding. By contrast, mAb 33B6 blocked cell binding to the endothelial surface protein vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. These results suggest that the beta 1 epitope defined by mAb 33B6 may play a novel role in regulating leukocyte adhesive interactions.","['Bednarczyk, J L', 'Wygant, J N', 'Szabo, M C', 'Molinari-Storey, L', 'Renz, M', 'Fong, S', 'McIntyre, B W']","['Bednarczyk JL', 'Wygant JN', 'Szabo MC', 'Molinari-Storey L', 'Renz M', 'Fong S', 'McIntyre BW']","['Department of Immunology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA/genetics', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/pathology', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.2400510412 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1993 Apr;51(4):465-78. doi: 10.1002/jcb.2400510412.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the potential for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) resistance to these compounds was evaluated by serial passage of the virus in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MT-2 cells in the presence of increasing drug concentrations.

Double immunostaining with antibodies to band 3 in combination with spectrin or ankyrin revealed that these proteins become expressed synchronously during normal human erythropoiesis. In contrast, both murine erythroleukemia cells (induced by fibronectin and dimethyl sulfoxide to differentiate in vitro) and erythroblasts from a patient suffering from erythroleukemia displayed distinct asynchronicity in expression of these proteins, ie, ankyrin and spectrin were synthesized first, followed by band 3 at a later stage of erythroid development. After the onset of band 3 expression in human erythroleukemia cells, an increase of membrane-associated fluorescence was detectable for both ankyrin and spectrin, supporting the general view that band 3 promotes assembly of the membrane cytoskeleton. These findings indicate that the current concept of a sequential expression of spectrin/ankyrin and band 3 is valid only for erythroleukemia cells or transformed erythropoietic cell lines but does not occur in normal erythropoiesis, during which these proteins become expressed simultaneously.","['Nehls, V', 'Zeitler-Zapf, P', 'Drenckhahn, D']","['Nehls V', 'Zeitler-Zapf P', 'Drenckhahn D']","['Institute of Anatomy, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*metabolism', 'Ankyrins/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Spectrin/*metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time Factors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1993 May;142(5):1565-73.,,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Ankyrins)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",,,,,PMC1886907,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected trisomy 12 in 35% of 117 CLL patients. Only 34.6% of cases detected by FISH were detected by CG. Twelve patients had low levels of trisomic cells (4% to 11%) relative to clonal B cells (47.5% to 86%), suggestive of clonal evolution. Untreated patients with trisomy 12 were predominantly male (P < .05) and had an increased incidence of splenomegaly (P < .03). Patients with trisomy 12 were more likely to be previously treated and had advanced Binet stage compared with those without trisomy 12. The median survival was shorter in patients with trisomy 12 (7.8 years) and patients with other chromosomal abnormalities without trisomy 12 by FISH (5.5 years) than in patients with diploid karyotypes (14.4 years). The response to fludarabine was similar to that of patients with diploid karyotypes, but there was a trend for earlier disease progression. FISH detected residual disease in all patients with trisomy 12 in complete (n = 6) or partial remission (n = 4). As few as 1 trisomic cell in 5,000 was detected by performing FISH on fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted cells. Trisomy 12 was absent in T cells in patients with trisomy 12. We conclude that FISH identifies trisomy 12 approximately 2.6 times more often than CG, readily identifies minimal residual disease, and predicts for a shorter median survival.","['Escudier, S M', 'Pereira-Leahy, J M', 'Drach, J W', 'Weier, H U', 'Goodacre, A M', 'Cork, M A', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Keating, M J', 'Andreeff, M']","['Escudier SM', 'Pereira-Leahy JM', 'Drach JW', 'Weier HU', 'Goodacre AM', 'Cork MA', 'Trujillo JM', 'Keating MJ', 'Andreeff M']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Monocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', '*Trisomy']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67866-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 May 15;81(10):2702-7.,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD17665/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was the definition of phenotypically distinct disease subsets and the correlation of adhesion molecule phenotypes with clinical parameters. Expression of CD58 on B-CLL cells defined more advanced disease stages. In comparison with beta chain-positive cases, patients whose cells did not express beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 integrin chains fell into the most favorable prognostic group, with lower lymphocytosis and the absence of splenomegaly, diffuse bone marrow infiltration, and therapy requirement. A novel finding was the expression of beta 3 chains on cells from a minority (12 of 74) of B-CLL cases. beta 3 chains were always coexpressed with beta 1 and beta 2 chains. Two-color immunofluorescence analyses of adhesion molecules such as alpha x beta 2 integrin (LeuM5) and L-selectin (Leu8) showed that these markers were detectable on variable proportions of leukemic cells, thus confirming the intraclonal phenotypic heterogeneity of B-CLL. Differences in the intensity of CD44 expression were also shown among the various B-CLL clones. Finally, no major variations were shown by comparison of adhesion molecule phenotypes of leukemic cells simultaneously obtained from blood and bone marrow, and of CD5+ versus CD5- clones.","['De Rossi, G', 'Zarcone, D', 'Mauro, F', 'Cerruti, G', 'Tenca, C', 'Puccetti, A', 'Mandelli, F', 'Grossi, C E']","['De Rossi G', 'Zarcone D', 'Mauro F', 'Cerruti G', 'Tenca C', 'Puccetti A', 'Mandelli F', 'Grossi CE']","['Hematology, Human Biopathology Department, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/biosynthesis']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67863-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 May 15;81(10):2679-87.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized CD34+ cells from 18 patients with metastatic solid tumors or refractory lymphomas were cultured for up to 28 days in a liquid culture system. The effects of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), G-CSF, macrophage-CSF (M-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), erythropoietin (EPO), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interferon-gamma, as well as 36 combinations of these factors were tested. A combination of five hematopoietic growth factors, including SCF, EPO, IL-1, IL-3, and IL-6, was identified as the optimal combination of growth factors for both the expansion of total nucleated cells as well as the expansion of clonogenic progenitor cells. Proliferation peaked at days 12 to 14, with a median 190-fold increase (range, 46- to 930-fold) of total clonogenic progenitor cells. Expanded progenitor cells generated myeloid (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage), erythroid (burst-forming unit-erythroid), as well as multilineage (colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte) colony-forming units. The number of multilineage colonies increased 250-fold (range, 33- to 589-fold) as compared with pre-expansion values. Moreover, the absolute number of early hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+/HLA-DR-; CD34+/CD38-), as well as the number of 4-HC-resistant progenitors within expanded cells increased significantly. Interferon-gamma was shown to synergize with the 5-factor combination, whereas the addition of GM-CSF significantly decreased the number of total clonogenic progenitor cells. Large-scale expansion of PB CD34+ cells (starting cell number, 1.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells) in autologous plasma supplemented with the same 5-factor combination resulted in an equivalent expansion of progenitor cells as compared with the microculture system. In summary, our data indicate that chemotherapy plus G-CSF-mobilized PBPCs from cancer patients can be effectively expanded ex vivo. Moreover, our data suggest the feasibility of large-scale expansion of PBPCs, starting from small numbers of PB CD34+ cells. The number of cells expanded ex vivo might be sufficient for repetitive use after high-dose chemotherapy and might be candidate cells for therapeutic gene transfer.","['Brugger, W', 'Mocklin, W', 'Heimfeld, S', 'Berenson, R J', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Kanz, L']","['Brugger W', 'Mocklin W', 'Heimfeld S', 'Berenson RJ', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Kanz L']","['Albert-Ludwigs University Medical Center, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67850-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 May 15;81(10):2579-84.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'VIP protocol 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell cycle and DNA repair activity.,69-75,"Irradiation with a 3-s pulse of 254 nm UV light has been used to study sensitivity to mutagenic agents of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell cultures in correlation with the cell cycle. A dose of UV irradiation was chosen that had no consequences for cell viability and growth. For this reason phenotypic effects were monitored on the progeny of all cells of the irradiated cultures by scoring those unable to undergo erythroid differentiation upon induction with dimethyl sulfoxide. The very short period of irradiation made it possible to show that MEL cells, synchronized by two sequential blocks of deoxythymidine and one of hydroxyurea (HU), are sensitive to UV irradiation only in a very short period of time at about 60 min after release from HU block. Determinations of deoxythymidine incorporation into DNA show that this time period corresponds only marginally to the initial part of the S phase during which irradiation has no consequences for cell properties. Cells are not sensitive to UV irradiation in G1 and in G2/M unless, immediately after irradiation and for the following 2 h, cultures are treated with 1 mM HU to interfere with DNA repair. Alkaline sucrose gradient analyses show at all tested times that irradiation leads to fragmentation of cell DNA. The data suggest that an immediate increase of deoxythymidine incorporation into DNA following irradiation is not necessary for the efficient repair of damaged DNA. In fact, the percent of cells expressing the erythroid phenotype is normal in the progeny of cells irradiated in G2/M, when TdR incorporation is at a minimum. Repair activities appear then to be mechanistically divided into two phases, (1) recognition labeling of the altered sites and (2) reconstitution of the DNA sequences. The first activity appears to be operative at all phases of the cycle, the second activity is little or not operative in G2/M, possibly delayed to the following G1 period.","['Foresti, M', 'Gaudio, L', 'Paoletti, I', 'Geraci, G']","['Foresti M', 'Gaudio L', 'Paoletti I', 'Geraci G']","['Dipartimento di Genetica, Biologia Generale e Molecolare, Universita Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis/*radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*radiation effects', 'Hydroxyurea/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mitotic Index', 'S Phase/radiation effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0921-8777(93)90059-P [pii]', '10.1016/0921-8777(93)90059-p [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1993 Jun;294(1):69-75. doi: 10.1016/0921-8777(93)90059-p.,,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall component lipoarabinomannan (LAM), mycobacterial heat shock protein-65 kD, and M. tuberculosis culture filtrate, devoid of LPS as assessed by the Amebocyte Lysate assay, stimulate the production of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta proteins and mRNA from mononuclear phagocytes (THP-1 cells). The effect of LAM on the release of these cytokines was specific, as only LAM stimulation was inhibited by anti-LAM monoclonal antibody. Interestingly, we found that LAM and Gram-negative bacterial cell wall-associated endotoxin LPS may share a similar mechanism in their stimulatory action as demonstrated by inhibition of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta release by monoclonal antibodies to CD14. Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody MY4 inhibited both TNF alpha and IL-1 beta release with LAM and LPS but no effect was observed with other mycobacterial proteins. An isotype antibody control did not inhibit release of cytokines under the same experimental conditions. M. tuberculosis and its components upregulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNAs in THP-1 cells. Nuclear run-on assay for IL-1 beta demonstrated that LAM increased the transcription rate. The induction of IL-1 beta was regulated at the transcriptional level, in which these stimuli acted through cis-acting element(s) on the 5' flanking region of the IL-1 beta genomic DNA. M. tuberculosis cell wall component LAM acts similarly to LPS in activating mononuclear phagocyte cytokine TNF alpha and IL-1 beta release through CD14 and synthesis at the transcriptional level; both cytokines are key participants in the host immune response to tuberculosis.","['Zhang, Y', 'Doerfler, M', 'Lee, T C', 'Guillemin, B', 'Rom, W N']","['Zhang Y', 'Doerfler M', 'Lee TC', 'Guillemin B', 'Rom WN']","['Department of Medicine, Bellevue Hospital Center, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', '*Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116430 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 May;91(5):2076-83. doi: 10.1172/JCI116430.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (lipoarabinomannan)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,PMC288206,,,,,,,,,,

Antisera to the cloned receptors competed for 125I-TNF-alpha binding to plasma membranes isolated from various transformed cell lines but not to HLPM.

We have examined DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT on RNA and DNA templates derived from the HIV-1 genome using a primer extension assay in vitro. Analysis of polymerization products on sequencing gels revealed strong pauses in synthesis, on both RNA and DNA templates, in homopolymeric nucleotide runs, and at regions of predicted secondary structure. Polymerization pauses occurred in runs of template rGs (> or = 4 bases) and rCs (> or = 3 bases) during minus-strand synthesis on RNA templates, and in most runs (> or = 4 bases) of template dTs and dAs during plus-strand synthesis on DNA templates. Pausing also occurred on both templates within the first few nucleotides of the predicted hairpin structures of the Rev response element. The locations of pauses were dependent on template sequence and were unaffected by primer positioning, RT concentration, and ionic strength. Recombinant and virion-derived HIV-1 RTs showed similar pausing patterns. DNA products that accumulated at HIV-1 RT pause sites on RNA templates were extended by continued incubation with excess RT from Moloney murine leukemia virus, showing that the RNA templates were not broken or otherwise unable to support polymerization. Polymerizations conducted in the presence of a poly(rA) oligo(dT) trap showed that pausing results from two mechanisms: 1) RT remaining bound to the primer-template and polymerizing at a greatly reduced rate, or 2) RT dissociating from the primer-template. These results demonstrate that specific HIV-1 RNA and DNA template sequences are capable of interrupting processive DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT in vitro. Pausing may serve specific functions in HIV-1 replication and mutagenesis. Moreover, these data suggest that one or more accessory factors are required to complete proviral DNA synthesis in vivo and that efficient HIV-1 DNA synthesis may require multiple origins.","['Klarmann, G J', 'Schauber, C A', 'Preston, B D']","['Klarmann GJ', 'Schauber CA', 'Preston BD']","['Laboratory for Cancer Research, College of Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, pol', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/*genetics/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Virion/enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Virus Replication']",1993/05/05 00:00,1993/05/05 00:01,['1993/05/05 00:00'],"['1993/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)98417-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 May 5;268(13):9793-802.,"['P30 ES05022/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA48174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S15 CA51339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,"['env', 'pol']",,,,,,,,,,,,['J Biol Chem 1993 Jun 25;268(18):13764']

We have also shown that illimaquinone inhibits the RNase H activity of HIV-2 RT in addition to that of HIV-1 RT, murine leukemia virus RT, and Escherichia coli RNase H. Chemical modifications of HIV-1 RT by sulfhydryl-specific reagents, such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) have been demonstrated to specifically inhibit the RNase H activity of the enzyme. Since our previous studies have suggested that cysteine 280 in HIV-1 RT interacts with the sulfhydryl reagents, we have examined the possibility that illimaquinone interacts with the RT molecules via amino acid residues located in the vicinity of cysteine 280 in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs. In the combined effect studies of illimaquinone and NEM, the two structurally unrelated compounds were shown to be mutually exclusive, exhibiting an antagonistic interaction with both HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus-associated RNase H activities. This implicates cysteine 280, in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs, to be in close proximity to the putative binding site of the enzyme to illimaquinone. The above conclusion is further supported by the fact that the RNase H activity of an enzymatically active mutant of HIV-1 RT, in which cysteine 280 was replaced by serine, was substantially more resistant to illimaquinone than the corresponding activity of the wild-type enzyme. The fact that NEM failed to inhibit E. coli RNase H as opposed to illimaquinone highlights a major difference between the retroviral and bacterial RNase H.","['Loya, S', 'Hizi, A']","['Loya S', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/genetics', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'HIV-2/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', '*RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Ribonuclease H/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1993/05/05 00:00,1993/05/05 00:01,['1993/05/05 00:00'],"['1993/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)98353-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 May 5;268(13):9323-8.,['AI31790/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Quinones)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '71678-03-0 (illimaquinone)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation occurred after removal of the drug, as shown by the gradual appearance of morphological, cytochemical, phenotypical, and functional cell maturation, along with the loss of the proliferative potential. Adherence to the plastic surface, a further marker of monocytic differentiation, was observed in long-term cultures of treated cells. Molecular events induced by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine included a decrease in DNA methylation, along with a dramatic, permanent reduction in the levels of c-myc transcripts; both these events were detectable early (24 to 48 hours) after the start of drug administration. A stable increase in c-fos and c-fms mRNAs, regarded as molecular markers of monocytic differentiation, was observed only after the end of treatment, in concomitance with the appearance of differentiation markers. The latency between early and late effects elicited by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in U-937 cells suggests that the drug, presumably through DNA hypomethylation, is able to promote 'competence' to differentiate, via the activation of the regulatory program(s) needed for a monoblast to maturate, rather than directly inducing the expression of differentiation-specific genes. The temporal order of events described renders the present model suitable for the study of the human monocytic developmental program and of the molecular regulatory steps entailing differentiation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.","['Attadia, V']",['Attadia V'],"['Division of Experimental Oncology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, fos', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Monocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7 Suppl 1:9-16.,,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,"['c-fos', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the relationship between the in vitro sensitivity to Decitabine of blast progenitors and the clinical outcome, in nine AML patients treated in vivo with Decitabine within a phase II trial carried out at two different institutions. Leukemic blast progenitors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergo terminal divisions giving rise to colonies in methylcellulose. The self-renewal capacity of blast progenitors is conversely reflected by a secondary methylcellulose assay after exponential growth of clonogenic cells in suspension cultures. Three out of four patients, in which clonogenic cells in methylcellulose were strongly suppressed by Decitabine and clonogenic growth of blasts cultured in suspension was only slightly affected, failed on Decitabine treatment in vivo. Two subjects, whose blast progenitors in suspension culture were significantly inhibited by Decitabine, obtained a positive hematological response (complete or partial remission, CR or PR) and an additional patient showing a similar in vitro pattern died in induction with an hypoplastic marrow without morphological evidence of persistant leukemia. Interestingly two patients displaying an unfavourable in vitro pattern (i.e. a minor suppression of self-renewal mitoses as evinced from suspension cultures) achieved a hematological response (CR and PR) upon in vivo therapy with Decitabine. The in vitro response to Decitabine of clonogenic progenitors from both these patients shifted to a favourable pattern (i.e. major suppression of self-renewal versus terminal mitoses) following manipulation of culture conditions by the addition or removal of exogenous growth factors. In addition, in a further patient refractory to treatment with Decitabine in vivo, similar alterations of the culture conditions were unable to modify the unfavourable pattern of response to the drug in vitro. Our results indicate that the sensitivity of blast progenitors in suspension cultures strongly correlates with the remission outcome of the patients. From our data, it also appears that alterations of culture microenvironment are able to modify the response of AML blasts to Decitabine, unveiling the 'hidden' sensitivity of leukemic progenitors to the drug in cases characterized by a discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results, i.e. apparent in vitro resistance and favourable clinical outcome.","['Gattei, V', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Petti, M C', 'Da Ponte, A', 'Zagonel, V', 'Pinto, A']","['Gattei V', 'Aldinucci D', 'Petti MC', 'Da Ponte A', 'Zagonel V', 'Pinto A']","['Leukemia Unit, INRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7 Suppl 1:42-8.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and the toxicity of Decitabine, used as single induction agent, in the treatment of poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and to explore its mechanism of action. A total of 12 patients were treated with Decitabine at 90-120 mg/m2 as a four hour intravenous infusion, three times daily for three consecutive days every four to six weeks. A minimum of two courses were required for response evaluation and to consider a patient as therapeutic failure. A total of 10/12 patients were fully evaluable for response; three patients achieved a complete remission (CR) and one a partial remission (PR). Extra-hematological toxicity was generally mild.

Two patients affected by refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and eight with RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) were treated with Decitabine at a daily dose of 45 mg/m2, divided into three 4 h infusions for 3 days (six patients) or as continuous infusion of 50 mg/m2 for 3 days (four patients). Treatment with Decitabine resulted in a significant increase in circulating neutrophils, platelets, and hemoglobin with respect to pretreatment values in over 50% of patients. These changes were accompanied by the improvement of the marrow myeloid relative differentiation index (median fivefold increase in the whole group of patients) and of the myeloid to erythroid cell ratio (median twofold increase) in most of the patients. In four out of ten patients a complete normalization of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) picture (complete hematologic response) was obtained. The evaluation of the percentage of CD34-positive BM cells showed a slow but progressive reduction of early leukemic progenitors in most of the patients. A transient slight BM hypoplasia was obtained in less than 50% of patients while a severe marrow aplasia was never observed in our group of MDS patients during treatment with Decitabine. Extra-hematological toxicity was very mild in all the patients. The preliminary results of our study indicate that Decitabine is able to induce trilineage hematological responses in advanced MDS patients along with a stable normalization of the PB and BM picture in some of the subjects. Decitabine appears an active agent in advanced MDS and this deserves careful investigation in this heterogeneous group of disorders.","['Zagonel, V', 'Lo Re, G', 'Marotta, G', 'Babare, R', 'Sardeo, G', 'Gattei, V', 'De Angelis, V', 'Monfardini, S', 'Pinto, A']","['Zagonel V', 'Lo Re G', 'Marotta G', 'Babare R', 'Sardeo G', 'Gattei V', 'De Angelis V', 'Monfardini S', 'Pinto A']","['Leukemia Unit, INRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/*drug therapy', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7 Suppl 1:30-5.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These agents are cytotoxic per se, but also induce differentiation in several experimental systems, most notably the induction of muscle, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in cultures of drug-treated mouse embryo fibroblasts. The mechanisms underlying this drug-induced differentiation have been difficult to unravel, a fact which limits the rational design of differentiation therapy as a modulator of cancer using these agents. Induction of new developmental pathways in cultured cells involves stable, heritable changes, presumably of an epigenetic nature. Our early studies demonstrated that changes in methylation of cytosine in DNA occurred concurrently with changes in developmental potential, and that the presence of 5-azacytosine in DNA interfered with the action of DNA methyltransferase. Since DNA methylation is believed to be involved at some level in the regulation of gene expression, the hypothesis was developed that changes in methylation allowed the expression of new genes whose activity initiated new pathways of differentiation. The characterization of this drug-induced system of differentiation has therefore opened the way to identifying genes directly involved in the initiation or modification of pathways of differentiation. The first of these was MyoD, a member of a family of myogenic determination genes. Expression of MyoD in myogenic cell lines has been correlated with loss of methylation at specific sites in the genome, but the critical events leading to expression of MyoD and muscle differentiation are poorly understood. Recent developments in understanding this mechanism are discussed.","['Taylor, S M']",['Taylor SM'],"['Department of Microbiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cartilage/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Muscle Proteins/*physiology', 'MyoD Protein', 'Phenotype']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7 Suppl 1:3-8.,['CA 83560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite trials testing numerous agents in patients with MDS, no single drug has yet emerged as the accepted standard of treatment.

We administered 5-azacytidine, a cell-cycle specific ring analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside cytosine, as a continuous intravenous infusion, 75 mg/m2 per day for 7 days every 4 weeks. Patients had refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) or refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T).

Mild to moderate nausea and/or vomiting was the most common side effect (63%). Myelosuppression, either bone marrow hypoplasia or drug related cytopenias requiring a reduction in the dose of azacitidine, occurred in only 33% of the patients. Prior to treatment, bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells were assayed in vitro. Colonies derived from erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-e) were undetectable in one patient and reduced in two. The number of colonies derived from erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-e)) were also reduced in two of the three patients. In the two patients with detectable colony growth prior to treatment, colony number decreased by day 8 of the first cycle, followed by a subsequent increase. Continued treatment with azacitidine led to normalization of the number of CFU-e derived colonies as well as an increase in the number of BFU-e derived colonies.

The objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro interaction of 5-Aza-CdR with different agents which may increase its clinical efficacy. Since 5-Aza-CdR has been used in combination with amsacrine in patients with relapsed leukemia, we have investigated the in vitro antileukemic activity of these agents in combination on human HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells. For a 24-hour drug exposure, we observed that the interaction of 5-Aza-CdR with amsacrine was subadditive to was synergistic with respect to the loss of clonogenicity of the HL-60 leukemic cells as demonstrated by a colony assay. We have also investigated the interaction of 5-Aza-CdR with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, an agent that can induce in vitro differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells. The combination of 5-Aza-CdR with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 produced a synergistic reduction in the clonogenicity of the HL-60 leukemic cells. These results indicate that 5-Aza-CdR can interact synergistically with both cytotoxic agents and agents that induce differentiation, and can provide some rationale for clinical investigations on these combinations in patients with acute leukemia. We have also explored other approaches to increase the clinical effectiveness of 5-Aza-CdR by investigating the in vitro effect of different inhibitors of human cytidine deaminase, the enzyme responsible for the rapid in vivo inactivation of this analogue.","['Momparler, R L', 'Dore, B T', 'Labiberte, J', 'Momparler, L F']","['Momparler RL', 'Dore BT', 'Labiberte J', 'Momparler LF']","['Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7 Suppl 1:17-20.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degree of hypermethylation of these sites can be directly correlated with the percentage of immature cells, whilst progressive hypomethylation occurs during the maturation of the granulocyte lineage. We have examined samples obtained from CML patients at diagnosis, during chronic phase, and blast crisis to examine the degree of methylation of this region in the non-rearranged BCR gene and the rearranged BCR-ABL gene. A low degree of methylation of the non-rearranged gene, similar to that observed in normal individuals, was observed in diagnosis and chronic phase samples. Increased methylation was observed during blast crisis indicative of the presence of immature cells in the samples. In contrast, a significantly lower degree of methylation was observed in the rearranged BCR-ABL gene at the onset of blast crisis. Division of the samples into those patients who had lost exon b3 during the formation of the BCR/ABL gene and those that had retained exon b3 produced differing patterns of methylation during disease progression. The former group, who also expressed a b2-a2 mRNA, showed an increase in methylation of the non-rearranged BCR gene prior to and during blast crisis, with a inverse decrease in the methylation of the BCR/ABL gene. Those patients who had retained exon b3, and expressed a b3-a2 mRNA, showed no change in the extent of methylation of the BCR/ABL gene but did exhibit an increase in methylation of the BCR gene during blast crisis. The consequence of the differing degree of methylation during disease progression could affect, to some extent, the specificity of protein binding or RNA expression.","['Mills, K I', 'Sproul, A M', 'Burnett, A K']","['Mills KI', 'Sproul AM', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease HpaII', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Oncogenes', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Time Factors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):707-11.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HpaII)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)']",,,"['M-bcr', 'abl']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1988, we developed NOVP [mitoxantrone (Novantrone), vincristine, vinblastine, prednisone], designed as adjuvant chemotherapy to treat patients with clinically staged I-II Hodgkin's disease who had unfavorable features, including B symptoms, large mediastinal masses, and hilar lymph node involvement. We also included patients with peripheral masses > or = 10 cms and those with stage III disease. In the second phase of this study, we treated patients without adverse features, in order to avoid laparotomy. The treatment plan included three cycles of NOVP, followed by radiotherapy to the mantle and the abdomen, with fields depending upon disease presentation. Patients with large mediastinal masses or hilar involvement also received low dose lung radiotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hagemeister, F B']",['Hagemeister FB'],"['U.T.

Since co-treatment with hemopoietic growth facts (HGFs) GM-CSF and IL-3 have been demonstrated to enhance the metabolism and cytotoxic effects of HIDAC against leukemic progenitor cells, we examined the effect of HGFs pIXY 321 (a GM-CSF/IL3 fusion protein) and G-CSF on HIDAC induced PCD and related gene expressions as well as HIDAC mediated colony growth inhibition of human myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment with G-CSF or pIXY 321 alone for up to 24 hours neither suppressed nor induced PCD in HL-60 or KG-1 cells. However, exposure to either of the HGFs for 20 hours followed by a combined treatment for 4 hours with HIDAC plus either of the HGFs versus HIDAC alone significantly enhanced the intracellular Ara-CTP accumulation and the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of PCD. This was temporally associated with a marked induction of C-jun expression but a significant repression in BCL-2 and c-myc expressions. In addition, the treatment with either of the HGFs plus HIDAC versus HIDAC alone produced a significantly greater inhibition of the clonogenic survival of the myeloid leukemia cells. These findings underscore an additional mechanism of leukemic cell death induced by HIDAC which can be modulated by the HGFs to improve the antileukemic activity of HIDAC.","['Bhalla, K', 'Tourkina, E', 'Huang, Y', 'Tang, C', 'Mahoney, M E', 'Ibrado, A M']","['Bhalla K', 'Tourkina E', 'Huang Y', 'Tang C', 'Mahoney ME', 'Ibrado AM']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425-2225.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309149124 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;10 Suppl:123-31. doi: 10.3109/10428199309149124.,,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (PIXY321 fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar increases were observed using formaldehyde-fixed neutrophils. Cellular association and likely the intracellular presence of rickettsiae was required for enhanced neutrophil adhesion, because culture medium conditioned by infected cells or rickettsiae rendered noninfective by pretreatment with tetracycline were ineffective at inducing neutrophil adhesion. Increases in neutrophil adhesion caused by infection were blocked by pretreatment of ECs with cycloheximide, suggesting the involvement of new protein synthesis in the cells' response. Flow cytometric analysis of infected cells showed increases in cell surface expression of E-selectin compared with uninfected control cells. Furthermore, incubation of 6- to 8-hour infected cells with a blocking monoclonal antibody against E-selectin (BB11) inhibited neutrophil adhesion an average of 61%. These results suggest the involvement of E-selectin in neutrophil adhesion to infected ECs occurring early in the course of the infection process.

The Japan Cooperative Group of Leukemia/Lymphoma.,2399-405,"Forty patients (9 females and 31 males; mean age 41.9 years) with CD7+ acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) were investigated; they were classified into the following subgroups according to French-American-British classification: 15 M1, 18 M2, 3 M4, and 4 M5. Leukemic cells from all the patients were negative for T-cell-specific antigens, surface CD3, and T-cell-receptor molecules. The sex and age distributions were different from those of CD7- AML patients (P < .01). Hepatomegaly and central nervous system involvement were also frequent in the CD7+ AML patients. The phenotype of and responsiveness to hematopoietic growth factors by the leukemic cells showed their immaturity, as evidenced by frequent expression of CD34, HLA-DR, and TdT, and the greatest growth response to interleukin-3. No particular karyotypic abnormality was shown. One hundred eighty AML patients were treated with a therapeutic regimen routinely used for AML. The CD7+ AML patients showed a significantly lower response than CD7- AML patients (P < .01), and had a poorer prognosis (P < .01). CD7+ AML patients with M1 or M5b had unfavorable responses to the therapeutic regimen in comparison with patients with M2, M4, or M5a. In addition, 3 of 4 CD7+ CD2+ AML patients, who did not respond to the therapy, were induced into complete remission with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. The results presented here indicate the diagnostic importance of CD7 positivity in AML, suggesting that the cellular and clinical characteristics of CD7+ AML are sufficient for it to be recognized as a distinct category of AML.","['Kita, K', 'Miwa, H', 'Nakase, K', 'Kawakami, K', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Tanaka, I', 'Ohta, C', 'Tsutani, H', 'Oguma, S']","['Kita K', 'Miwa H', 'Nakase K', 'Kawakami K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Shirakawa S', 'Tanaka I', 'Ohta C', 'Tsutani H', 'Oguma S', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/blood/genetics', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis/blood/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72843-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 May 1;81(9):2399-405.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",,,,,,"['Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):3097-8.

Under cell-free conditions, chemically unrelated photosensitizers (methylene blue, acridine orange, proflavin, riboflavin, hematoporphyrin) induce the same type of DNA damage. It is characterized by a high number of base modifications sensitive to the repair endonuclease FPG protein (formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase), while both the number of DNA strand breaks and the number of sites of base loss (sensitive to exonuclease III or endonuclease IV) is low. Therefore the damage is markedly different from that induced by hydroxyl radicals. Mechanistically, the generation of the base modifications sensitive to FPG protein involves singlet oxygen in some, but possibly not all cases, as substituting D2O for H2O increases the reaction yield six-fold in the case of methylene blue, but only 1.4-fold in the case of acridine orange. In plasmids from Salmonella typhimurium strains treated with methylene blue or acridine orange plus light and from Escherichia coli strains treated with acridine orange or proflavin plus light, the same type of damage was observed as under cell-free conditions. In L1210 mouse leukemia cells exposed to acridine orange plus light, the numbers of modifications sensitive to FPG protein and exonuclease III were quantified, in addition to strand breaks, by a modified alkaline elution assay. Again, the number of base modifications sensitive to FPG protein was found to be several-fold higher than the number of strand breaks and sites of base loss. It has to be concluded that the DNA damage in the intact cells is not mediated by hydroxyl radicals or cellular nucleases, but by the same mechanism as operates under cell-free conditions with these agents.","['Epe, B', 'Pflaum, M', 'Boiteux, S']","['Epe B', 'Pflaum M', 'Boiteux S']","['Institute of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Acridine Orange/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Bacteriophages/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell-Free System', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Bacterial/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA, Viral/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Hematoporphyrins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Light', 'Methylene Blue/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Riboflavin/pharmacology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(93)90091-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(93)90091-q [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1993 May;299(3-4):135-45. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(93)90091-q.,,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)', 'TLM2976OFR (Riboflavin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell neoplasms (26 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], four chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], four acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) received 7-day continuous infusion anti-B4-bR. Successive cohorts of at least three patients were treated at doses of 10 to 70 micrograms/kg/d for 7 days with the dose increased by 10 micrograms/kg/d for each cohort. The initial three cohorts of patients (10, 20, and 30 micrograms/kg/d x 7 days) also received a bolus infusion of 20 micrograms/kg before beginning the continuous infusion. RESULTS: The MTD was reached at 50 micrograms/kg/d x 7 days. The DLTs were National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) grade IV reversible increases in AST and ALT, and grade IV decreases in platelet counts. Adverse reactions included fevers, nausea, headaches, myalgias, hypoalbuminemia, dyspnea, edema, and capillary leak syndrome. Potentially therapeutic serum levels of anti-B4-bR could be sustained for 4 days in patients treated at the MTD. Two complete responses (CRs), three partial responses (PRs), and 11 transient responses (TRs) were observed. CONCLUSION: Anti-B4-bR can be administered safely by 7-day continuous infusion with tolerable, reversible toxicities to patients with relapsed B-cell neoplasms. Although occasional responses were seen, future trials will use anti-B4-bR in patients with lower tumor burdens to circumvent the obstacle of immunotoxin delivery to bulk disease.","['Grossbard, M L', 'Lambert, J M', 'Goldmacher, V S', 'Spector, N L', 'Kinsella, J', 'Eliseo, L', 'Coral, F', 'Taylor, J A', 'Blattler, W A', 'Epstein, C L']","['Grossbard ML', 'Lambert JM', 'Goldmacher VS', 'Spector NL', 'Kinsella J', 'Eliseo L', 'Coral F', 'Taylor JA', 'Blattler WA', 'Epstein CL', 'et al.']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', '*Ricin/immunology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.4.726 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Apr;11(4):726-37. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.4.726.,"['1K12CA01730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potency of the immunotoxin on PBMC was very high (IC50 = 1 - 10 pM) and was not affected by blood components. The conjugate was also very efficient in the inhibition of the proliferative response in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (IC50 = 10 pM). Moreover, the in vitro performance of the immunotoxin compared favorably with those reported for other anti-CD5-based immunoconjugates containing ricin A chain. The in vivo activity of the immunotoxin was assessed in the model of nu/nu mice bearing Jurkat leukemia.

Continuous cell lines.,1-25,"The relative scarcity of Hodgkin (H) and Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells within biopsies from cases with Hodgkin's disease (HD) is an impediment to the analysis of the nature and function of these cells. Continuous cell lines as uniform and permanently available sources of cells provide a valid alternative. Development of HD cell lines has proven to be rather difficult when compared with the results on leukemia and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Only a few cell lines containing cells that resemble in-vivo H-RS cells have been established. Because the in-vitro culture conditions favor the self-propagation of residual normal cells, e.g. Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells or monocyte/macrophage monolayers, early attempts at culturing HD tissue resulted mainly in the generation of such cell lines. Even for the bona fide HD cell lines it is difficult to prove that the immortalized cells originated from an H-RS cell. These 13 HD cell lines have been extensively characterized in a large variety of aspects. These data have resulted in widely varying conclusions about the nature of the cell lines. It is apparent that all HD cell lines are unique among hematopoietic cell lines and are also different from one another. No conclusive evidence towards the origin of the cells has been obtained for some cell lines, while others could be operationally, albeit not always unequivocally, assigned to the T- or B-cell or monocyte-macrophage lineages. The overall phenotypes are often not concordant with those of normal hematopoietic cells; some cell lines show clearly mixed lineage attributes. The artifactual expansion of non-HRS cells in culture and the acquisition or loss of certain properties during the adaptation to culture systems cannot be excluded. There was also a bias for the establishment of cell lines from cases with advanced clinical stages, nodular sclerosing subtype and pleural effusions. The extensive analysis of a few cell lines has provided a wealth of information useful for the understanding of the biology of H-RS cells. The striking heterogeneity could be reflective of a biologically heterogeneous disease.","['Drexler, H G']",['Drexler HG'],"['German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148499 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Jan;9(1-2):1-25. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148499.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",113,,"['H-ras', 'Ki-ras', 'N-ras', 'bcl-1', 'c-ets 1', 'c-ets 2', 'c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myb', 'c-mycmet']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen patients with Ph1-positive CML in the chronic phase were included in this study. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), containing more than 80% of stab and segmented neutrophils, were collected from peripheral blood (PB) by methylcellulose sedimentation after density gradient centrifugation. Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase mRNA (NAPmRNA) expression was very weak in all patients. When incubated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 24 h, the PMN of all patients expressed a detectable level of NAPmRNA. NAP score, which semiquantitatively reflects the activity of gene products, was also elevated after incubation with G-CSF in 12 patients. However, a higher dose of G-CSF was required for the maximum response than was the case for normal bone marrow PMN, which also manifested increases of NAPmRNA and its products on stimulation by G-CSF. The present study suggests that the PMN of CML express NAPmRNA and produce its products in response to G-CSF, but that they are less sensitive to G-CSF than normal bone marrow PMN.","['Tsushita, K', 'Hotta, T', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Murate, T', 'Saito, H']","['Tsushita K', 'Hotta T', 'Ichikawa A', 'Murate T', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Jan;57(1):45-52.,,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection with polymerase chain reaction.,1111-8,"Keratin filament are characteristically present in epithelial cells and tumors, but have also been detected in many normal and neoplastic non-epithelial cell types using immunohistochemical techniques. To investigate the validity of this seemingly aberrant protein expression, we applied the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to study keratin gene expression in a variety of non-epithelial tissues. Total RNA was extracted from nine samples of leiomyosarcoma, four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, seven normal bone marrows, normal lymph node, normal peripheral blood cells, freshly isolated and cultured endothelial cells, cultured skin fibroblasts, and the myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Amplification primers and probes for the three most primitive keratin types (8, 18, and 19) were synthesized using published gene sequences. RNA from the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, known to be rich in all three keratins, was used as positive control. Concurrently run actin primers were used to confirm RNA integrity. After an initial cycle with reverse transcriptase, PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles. Southern blots of the PCR products showed variably intense bands corresponding to keratin 8 and 18 gene products in all samples, offering conclusive evidence of keratin gene expression in cells of both stromal and hematopoietic derivation. However, keratin 19 gene transcription was not nearly so ubiquitous, being detected in normal fibroblasts and endothelial cells, two of four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and four of nine leiomyosarcoma, but not in normal lymph node, peripheral blood cells, HL-60 cells, or any of the seven normal bone marrows examined. Dilutional experiments showed PCR to be highly sensitive in the detection of keratin 19 gene expression, capable of registering one MCF-7 cell in 10(6) HL-60 cells. These studies show that variable levels of keratin 8 and 18 gene expression may be detected by PCR in a wide variety of non-epithelial tissues, supporting previous immunohistochemical and phylogenetic studies. However, keratin 19 gene expression appears to be more restricted and was not evident in any hematopoietic cells devoid of contaminating stromal elements. These findings suggest a role for PCR in the detection of epithelial micrometastasis in certain sites, particularly bone marrow.","['Traweek, S T', 'Liu, J', 'Battifora, H']","['Traweek ST', 'Liu J', 'Battifora H']","['Sylvia Cowan Laboratory of Surgical Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic System/physiology', 'Humans', 'Keratins/*genetics', 'Mesoderm/physiology', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1993 Apr;142(4):1111-8.,"['CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-37194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Molecular Probes)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",,,,,PMC1886881,,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that the decrease in Cu/Zn-SOD activity that accompanied differentiation would be reversed by supplementing the culture medium with copper. HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line, were induced to differentiate with retinoic acid and were concurrently supplemented with copper or a copper chelator, tetraethylenepentamine. The results showed that retinoic acid-treated cells contained more copper after differentiation. When the medium was supplemented with copper during retinoic acid treatment, the differentiating cells accumulated more copper than the nondifferentiating cells. Differentiation was accompanied by a significant reduction in Cu/Zn-SOD activity and a slight reduction in Cu/Zn-SOD protein. Activity returned to control values when an extracellular source of copper was provided. Incubation of retinoic acid-treated cells with the chelator showed that they lost proportionally less copper than the noninduced controls. Levels of Cu/Zn-SOD protein were not affected by the copper or chelator treatments. It was concluded that the requirement of differentiating HL-60 cells for copper is not related to providing copper for Cu/Zn-SOD activity. If a supplemental source is not supplied in the medium, then the cells may acquire copper from an intracellular source, namely Cu/Zn-SOD.","['Percival, S S', 'Bae, B', 'Patrice, M']","['Percival SS', 'Bae B', 'Patrice M']","['Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

This progression is aberrant in cancer, although the transition to differentiation can be reestablished in inducible leukemia cell lines. This report describes a gene, MCL1, that we isolated from the ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cell line during phorbol ester-induced differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway. Our results demonstrate that expression of MCL1 increases early in the induction, or ""programming,"" of differentiation in ML-1 (at 1-3 hr), before the appearance of differentiation markers and mature morphology (at 1-3 days). They further show that MCL1 has sequence similarity to BCL2, a gene involved in normal lymphoid development and in lymphomas with the t(14;18) chromosome translocation. MCL1 and BCL2 do not fall into previously known gene families. BCL2 differs from many oncogenes in that it inhibits programmed cell death, promoting viability rather than proliferation; this parallels the association of MCL1 with the programming of differentiation and concomitant maintenance of viability but not proliferation. Thus, in contrast to proliferation-associated genes, expression of MCL1 and BCL2 relates to the programming of differentiation and cell viability/death. The discovery of MCL1 broadens our perspective on an emerging MCL1/BCL2 gene family and will allow further comparison with oncogene families.","['Kozopas, K M', 'Yang, T', 'Buchan, H L', 'Zhou, P', 'Craig, R W']","['Kozopas KM', 'Yang T', 'Buchan HL', 'Zhou P', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Physiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Poly A/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.8.3516 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Apr 15;90(8):3516-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.8.3516.,['CA54385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['GENBANK/L08246'],"['BCL2', 'MCL1']",,PMC46331,,,,,,,,,,

The complete cDNA sequence is predicted to encode a protein of approximately 38,000 Da that contains a proline-rich amino domain and three TFIIIA-like zinc fingers within the carboxy domain. Additional sequence analyses reveal that the EKLF zinc fingers are most homologous to the Kruppel family of transcription factors and also allow us to predict potential DNA-binding target sites for the EKLF protein. On the basis of this prediction, we show that EKLF is able to bind the sequence CCA CAC CCT, an essential element of the beta-globin promoter. Its tissue distribution establishes that the EKLF transcript is expressed only in bone marrow and spleen, the two hematopoietic organs of the mouse, and analysis of murine cell lines indicates that EKLF expression is limited to erythroid and mast cell lines. Cotransfection assays establish that EKLF transcriptionally activates a target promoter that contains its DNA-binding site. The tissue expression pattern of EKLF, in conjunction with its function as a transcriptional activator, strongly suggests that the EKLF protein may be intimately involved in establishment and/or maintenance of the erythroid cell phenotype.","['Miller, I J', 'Bieker, J J']","['Miller IJ', 'Bieker JJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/physiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.5.2776-2786.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 May;13(5):2776-86. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.5.2776-2786.1993.,"['GM07280/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD23250/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,['GENBANK/M97200'],,,PMC359658,,,,,,,,,,

This technique has been applied to determine the expression of the oncoprotein c-erbB-2 in breast epithelial tumors. SK-BR-3, a breast cancer cell line with c-erbB-2 overexpression, can be identified by FCM from a mixed cell suspension using a monoclonal anti-human cytokeratin antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Using the mouse monoclonal anti-c-erbB-2 antibody, TA-1 (4.8 +/- 1.0 x isotype control), the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression in breast epithelial cells can be detected as an increase in indirect blue fluorescence by aminomethyl coumarin. MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line with normal c-erbB-2 expression, has baseline blue fluorescence (1.0 +/- 0.5 x isotope control). Twenty-one fresh breast specimens have been examined by FCM. Overexpression of c-erbB-2, defined by blue fluorescence ratio of TA-1/isotype control > or = 1.5 (> 3 SD from baseline), is detected in 0 of 3 patients with Stage I cancer, 5 of 14 patients with Stage II and III cancer, and 3 of 4 patients with proliferative disease. Patients with elevation of oncoprotein detected by FCM have corresponding RNA overexpression detected by Northern blot hybridization and increased gene amplification detected by Southern blot hybridization. FCM allows for the simultaneous identification of breast epithelial cells and the selective examination of these cells for the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein, thus minimizing stromal contamination.

Resting peripheral lymphocytes and monocytes expressed both ligand and receptor of the four cytokines at considerable levels. The leukemic blast cells of the M1-M4 phenotypes are characterized by almost complete lack of expression of IL-1 alpha, IL-3 and IL-6 and the constant and usually high expression of SCF. On the other hand, these myeloid blast cells express generally high levels of the four cytokine receptors. The data suggest that the regulation of the expression of IL-1 alpha, IL-3 and IL-6, at least in our limited number of leukemic cell populations studied, is independent of that of SCF. The results indicate that, at least in most of the leukemic myeloid blasts cells, the expression of SCF and its receptor, the c-kit oncogene, may permit an autocrine regulation of cell cycling.","['Ferrari, S', 'Grande, A', 'Manfredini, R', 'Tagliafico, E', 'Zucchini, P', 'Torelli, G', 'Torelli, U']","['Ferrari S', 'Grande A', 'Manfredini R', 'Tagliafico E', 'Zucchini P', 'Torelli G', 'Torelli U']","['Hematology Service, University of Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA/blood/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00082.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1993 Mar;50(3):141-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00082.x.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, IL-4 has been recognized as a negative regulatory factor in the growth of hematologic malignancy. In myeloid leukemias, IL-4 can suppress the growth of growth factor-dependent leukemic blast cells derived from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). IL-4 also suppresses the growth of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells through inhibiting the ""autocrine"" production of IL-6 or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In lymphoid malignancies, IL-4 can inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells from Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

Cross-linking of APO-1 induces apoptotic cell death in sensitive cells. We show here that APO-1 is an activation molecule on B cells. It was induced/enhanced on dense and buoyant tonsillar B cells, respectively, through surface Ig cross-linking in combination with interleukin-2 or by interferon-gamma together with tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These conditions also increased the amount of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) on these cells. Epstein-Barr virus transformants of peripheral B cells coexpressed APO-1 and CD54 at very high levels. Immunohistologically, Apo-1 was detectable at low levels in a subpopulation of follicle center B blasts and, at higher levels, in sinusoidal B cells. APO-1 was undetectable in follicular mantle B cells and plasma cells. In isolated tonsillar B cells, APO-1 was expressed in CD10+ follicle center cells. In acute B lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic B lymphocytic leukemia, and Burkitt's lymphomas, APO-1 and CD54 molecules were immunohistochemically undetectable. Coordinate expression of these antigens was found in mediastinal B-cell lymphomas. The mode of APO-1 and CD54 expression was correlated in follicle center cell lymphomas (P < .0019), but less stringently in hairy cell leukemia. No association was found in plasmacytomas. This was in line with the differential expression of these molecules found in reactive plasma cells. Expression of APO-1 in B cells of different stages of differentiation and, correspondingly, in certain B-cell neoplasias might suggest a role of this molecule in the induction of B-cell apoptosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with hematologic diseases and post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis were studied. Sera were assayed for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies with a second-generation enzyme-linked immunoassay. Sera from 40 patients were examined for the presence of HCV RNA with a nested PCR method. RESULTS: The clinical picture of acute non-A, non-B hepatitis did not differ from that described in other patient groups: however, progression to chronic hepatitis was very common (95%). Thirty-eight (95%) of 40 patients, whose sera were analysed both serologically and for the presence of HCV RNA had verified HCV infections. In some patients time to seroconversion was prolonged, up to more than 14 months. Seventeen patients with resistant or relapsed acute leukemia were treated with combination chemotherapy during the acute or chronic phase of hepatitis. Suppression of the inflammatory activity as reflected by a decrease of serum aminotransferase levels was recorded during the subsequent pancytopenic period. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C has a high chronicity rate in patients with hematologic disorders which parallels the situation of hepatitis B in the immunocompromised host. Furthermore, like the situation in hepatitis B, the hosts' immune response to infection seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of liver injury. Time to seroconversion may be prolonged and detection of HCV RNA is therefore important for diagnosis.","['Gruber, A', 'Norder, H', 'Magnius, L', 'Rotzen, M', 'Rubio, C', 'Grillner, L', 'Bjorkholm, M']","['Gruber A', 'Norder H', 'Magnius L', 'Rotzen M', 'Rubio C', 'Grillner L', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Division of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibody Formation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*therapy', 'Hepacivirus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis C/etiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Liver/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Time Factors', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058462 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64720-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1993 Mar;4(3):229-34. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058462.,,"['0 (Hepatitis Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results provided new insights into the complex mechanism of action of 6MP in human malignant lymphoblasts. Exposure to 2 microM 6MP resulted in a rapid inhibition of purine de novo synthesis (PDNS) by increased levels of Me-tIMP, resulting in increased PRPP levels and decreased purine ribonucleotides, affecting cell growth and clonal growth, and less cell death. DNA synthesis decreased, associated with an increasing delay of cells in S phase. Incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides into newly synthesized DNA resulted in an increasing arrest of cells in G2 + M phase. RNA synthesis, initially decreased, recovered partially, associated with a recovery of purine ribonucleotides. New formation of 6MP-nucleotides (tIMP) was only detected within the first 24 hr, and 6MP levels in the culture medium were already undetectable after 6 hr of exposure to 2 microM, indicating a high rate of incorporation and complete conversion of 6MP within this period. Incorporation of 6MP-nucleotides into DNA was 5 times as high as incorporation into RNA. Exposure to 10 microM 6MP resulted in early cytotoxicity at 24 hr, associated with a complete inhibition of PDNS by a large pool of Me-tIMP and lower levels of purine ribonucleotides as compared to 2 microM 6MP. A more severe delay of cells in S phase was associated with an inhibition of DNA synthesis to 14% of control within the first 24 hr, and an arrest in G2 + M phase. Further increasing levels of Me-tIMP caused an arrest of cells and late cytotoxicity in S phase at 48 hr, preventing further progression into G2 + M phase. Our data suggest that inhibition of PDNS due to Me-tIMP is a crucial event in the mechanism of 6MP cytotoxicity. It is responsible for decreased RNA synthesis and decreased availability of natural deoxyribonucleotides, causing a delay of DNA synthesis in S phase. This enhances incorporation of 6MP as thioguanine nucleotides into DNA in the S phase and subsequent late cytotoxicity in the G2 phase. However, with high concentrations of 6MP, the large pool of Me-tIMP causes severe reduction of natural deoxyribonucleotides in lymphoblasts with an active PDNS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Bokkerink, J P', 'Stet, E H', 'De Abreu, R A', 'Damen, F J', 'Hulscher, T W', 'Bakker, M A', 'van Baal, J A']","['Bokkerink JP', 'Stet EH', 'De Abreu RA', 'Damen FJ', 'Hulscher TW', 'Bakker MA', 'van Baal JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, St. Radboud University Hospital of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Inosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/analysis', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleotides/analysis', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/analysis']",1993/04/06 00:00,1993/04/06 00:01,['1993/04/06 00:00'],"['1993/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90045-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90045-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Apr 6;45(7):1455-63. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90045-x.,,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '131-99-7 (Inosine Monophosphate)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '7540-64-9 (Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate)', '76CK4YA5ZP (thioinosinic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 60 children with ALL were examined: 29 with ALL-L1, and 31 with ALL-L2, and 25 healthy children as control group, which were subdivided in three groups: A) 0-5, B) 6-10 and C) 11-18 years. We performed HbF and HbA2 quantification and Hb electrophoresis. G gamma and A gamma globin chain percentages were obtained with a new method based on the precipitation of the HbF eluate by Singer's method with sulphosalycilic acid, the globin chains were separated in polyacrylamide with Triton X-100 and quantified by densitometry. RESULTS: HbF showed similar levels in both ALL groups by the Betke and Singer's methods; (ALL-L1: 2.2 +/- 1.5%, ALL-L2: 2.0 +/- 1.2%; and ALL-L1: 2.0 +/- 1.2%, ALL-L2: 2.1 +/- 1.5% respectively), but there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) when compared with the control group (0.9 +/- 0.4%, and 1.0 +/- 0.6% for Betke and Singer's method).

There is a considerable degree of overlap in target cell specificity and the functional effects of GM-CSF and IL-3. GM-CSF and IL-3 induce a nearly identical pattern of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in certain cell lines, although their receptors have no kinase domains. Furthermore, their receptor complexes share one subunit (designated as beta). These observations raise the possibility that GM-CSF and IL-3 have a common signaling pathway. Here we show that both GM-CSF and IL-3 induce tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of the c-fps/fes proto-oncogene product (p92c-fes), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, in a human erythro-leukemia cell line, TF-1, which requires GM-CSF or IL-3 for growth. In addition, GM-CSF induces physical association between p92c-fes and the beta chain of the GM-CSF receptor. p92c-fes is therefore a possible signal transducer of several hematopoietic growth factors including GM-CSF and IL-3 through the common beta chain.","['Hanazono, Y', 'Chiba, S', 'Sasaki, K', 'Mano, H', 'Miyajima, A', 'Arai, K', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Hanazono Y', 'Chiba S', 'Sasaki K', 'Mano H', 'Miyajima A', 'Arai K', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Apr;12(4):1641-6.,,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",,,"['c-fes', 'c-fes/fps']",,PMC413378,,,,,,,,,,

Cases with low ALC (CLL-LLC), less than 5 x 10(9)/l, have not been included in the current staging systems, and would not be suspected of having CLL, or investigated for the disease, especially in the absence of clinical manifestations. On the other hand, the diagnostic value of the differential lymphocyte counts have not been emphasized. METHODS: Cell suspensions from peripheral blood of previously untreated cases of CLL-LLC (n = 12) and typical CLL (n = 189) were analyzed for immunologic evaluation of surface immunoglobulin (SIg), mouse erythrocyte rosettes, CD5, CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD2, as well as cytochemical evaluation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The results in CLL-LLC were compared statistically with typical CLL. RESULTS: The ages of the 12 patients with CLL-LLC ranged from 47 to 84 years. The absolute lymphocyte counts ranged from 1.5 x 10(9)/l to 4.9 x 10(9)/l, and the percentage of lymphocytes in the differential leukocyte counts ranged from 52% to 93%. None of the patients had signs and symptoms of CLL or other conditions that may cause reactive lymphocytosis. CLL-LLC demonstrated similar characteristics to typical CLL, i.e., weak expression of monoclonal SIg, mouse rosette formation, positive CD5, high CD19 and CD20, negative CD22 and TRAP. No statistical differences existed between the immunologic markers or between SIg isotype distribution in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of CLL-LLC constituted 6% of B-CLL and would have been missed if immunologic investigation was not carried out because of the absence of absolute lymphocytosis and clinical manifestations of CLL. Persistent relative lymphocytosis of > or = 50% of the differential leukocyte count in older individuals (older than 50 years of age), is an indication for further investigation of CLL by immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes and examination of bone marrow.","['Batata, A', 'Shen, B']","['Batata A', 'Shen B']","['Department of Pathology, Cox Institute, Wright State University School of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45429.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rosette Formation']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930501)71:9<2732::aid-cncr2820710908>3.0.co;2-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 May 1;71(9):2732-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930501)71:9<2732::aid-cncr2820710908>3.0.co;2-z.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurements made in intact L1210 cells showed that the rate of egress of [3H]MTX and [3H]MTX+G1 was different depending upon whether [3H]-MTX and its polyglutamates were accumulated intracellularly following biosynthesis during growth (3 hr) in the presence of [3H]MTX or when cells were pulse loaded (5 min) with [3H]MTX or [3H]-MTX+G1 just prior to measurement of egress. In the former case, [3H]MTX egressed with a T1/2 of 15 +/- 2 min, while [3H]MTX+G1 egressed with a T1/2 of 50 +/- 9 min. In pulse loaded cells, both [3H]MTX and [3H]MTX+G1 egressed with a T1/2 of 3.5 +/- 0.5 min. The same rapid egress of [3H]MTX and [3H]MTX+G1 seen following pulse loading was also documented in cells grown for 3 hr in the presence of nonradioactive MTX to normalize conditions with respect to the intracellular accumulation of [3H]MTX polyglutamates seen during exposure of cells to [3H]MTX during growth. In light of these results, MTX, MTX+G1, MTX+G2 and MTX+G4 were examined directly as permeants for the outwardly-directed ATP-dependent pump (Schlemmer SR and Sirotnak FM, J Biol Chem 267: 14746-14752, 1992) mediating most of MTX efflux in intact L1210 cells using inside-out plasma membrane vesicles isolated from these cells. ATP-dependent efflux of [3H]MTX and [3H]MTX+G1 exhibited values for Km of 46-50 microM and values for Vmax of 102-106 pmol/min/mg protein. As competitive inhibitors of [3H]MTX and [3H]MTX+G1 efflux, MTX+G1 and MTX, respectively, exhibited Ki values of 43-47 microM, that is, Km approximately Ki for both permeants. Also, values for Ki of 45-48 microM were obtained with MTX+G2 and MTX+G4 as competitive inhibitors of [3H]MTX efflux. From these results, we conclude that MTX and its polyglutamates are equivalent as copermeants for ATP-dependent efflux through the plasma membrane and that retentiveness of MTX polyglutamates is not determined at this level in these cells.","['Schlemmer, S R', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Schlemmer SR', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Program of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/24 00:00,1993/03/24 00:01,['1993/03/24 00:00'],"['1993/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90278-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90278-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Mar 24;45(6):1261-6. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90278-5.,"['CA 22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 46673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is reminiscent of pathologies observed in mice bearing mutations at the W and Sl loci, which are deficient in c-kit and c-kit ligand (CKL), respectively. The influence of 3,4-epoxybutene (EB), the primary metabolite of 1,3-butadiene, on the colony-forming response of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from C57BL/6, Sl, and W mice was investigated in order to elucidate the role of altered HPC regulation in the pathogenesis of 1,3-butadiene toxicity. EB pretreatment suppressed interleukin 3 colony formation and abrogated CKL synergism of the granulocyte-macrophage/colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) response in C57BL/6 cells, had no effect on colony formation induced by GM-CSF or granulocyte/colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone, and failed to suppress CKL-induced synergism of the G-CSF response. Experiments conducted with cells from Sl and W mice revealed that they lack the same primitive HPC targeted by EB. EB pretreatment in vitro and butadiene exposure in vivo mimic hematopoietic defects seen in W and Sl mice, suggesting that the pleotypic pathologies encountered in these murine models may be largely due to a common defect in primitive HPCs. Susceptibility to EB appears to define a functional subpopulation of primitive HPCs and illustrates that differences observed in the susceptibility of specific cytokine responses to chemical/drug exposure may provide a valuable tool for characterizing functional subpopulations of HPCs.","['Colagiovanni, D B', 'Stillman, W S', 'Irons, R D']","['Colagiovanni DB', 'Stillman WS', 'Irons RD']","['Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Butadienes/*toxicity', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.7.2803 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Apr 1;90(7):2803-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.7.2803.,,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",,,['c-kit'],,PMC46184,,,,,,,,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1993 Jul;90(13):6377']

Many reports have demonstrated a clonal expansion of B cells bearing the same idiotypic determinants as the myeloma protein (idiotypic B cells) in MM, suggesting that they could belong to the malignant clone. In order to investigate whether the B-cell population is a malignant component or not, either in the peripheral blood of patients with PCL or in the bone marrow of patients with MM, we derived B-cell lines by infecting, with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cultures in limiting dilution of mononuclear cells from six patients. A limiting dilution culture was used to prevent the elimination of slowly proliferating clones by the more rapidly dividing ones, and thus to get the most exact representation of the B-cell repertoire of these patients. The cloning efficiency of the EBV-infected cells was similar in patients and healthy individuals (range: 1 in 100 to 1 in 1650 B cells). All of the clones obtained from a single patient exhibited different clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements (IGR), proving the validity of our cloning technique. No tumoral clones (61 clones analysed) showed the IGR pattern specific of autologous myeloma cells. These results indicate that malignant plasma cells cannot be immortalized with EBV. These results show that, if malignant B cells (pre-switch or post-switch) exist, they could be present only in a minor population, and the corollary of this is that there is a major population of non-malignant B cells in the sites of tumoral proliferation of patients with MM. This is remarkable in view of numerous reports showing a profound defect of the polyclonal B lymphopoiesis in these patients, and even an absence of B lymphocytes. Thus, these results challenge the existence of a major compartment of malignant idiotypic B cells and favor the hypothesis of non-malignant B cells sharing cross-reactive idiotypes with the autologous myeloma protein.","['Commes, T', 'Clofent, G', 'Ghanem, N', 'Zhang, X G', 'Lefranc, M P', 'Bataille, R', 'Klein, B']","['Commes T', 'Clofent G', 'Ghanem N', 'Zhang XG', 'Lefranc MP', 'Bataille R', 'Klein B']","['INSERM U65, Universite Montpellier II, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/microbiology/*pathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):609-17.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of Ly+AML varies considerably between independent studies, both overall and with regard to individual antigens. On average, lymphoid-associated antigen expression is relatively low in AML. The reasons for some striking differences between conflicting reports are not clear, but are most probably due to various technical aspects including several arbitrary parameters. The data accumulated from the literature lead to the following conclusions: (i) use of different reagents against the CD surface antigens, different positive/negative cut-off levels, analysis of fresh or frozen cell material and variable sensitivities of the analytical instruments (expression of lymphoid-associated antigens was commonly weaker than myeloid-associated markers) seriously influence the results; (ii) most antigens (CD1, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD8, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22) were expressed on less than 10% of AML cases; (iii) the CD4 and CD7 antigens, also found on normal monocytic and immature myeloid progenitor cells, were detected in 24% and 15% of AML cases, and their expression correlated with FAB M4/M5 and M1/M2 morphology, respectively; (iv) differences between pediatric and adult Ly+AML were restricted to CD4 and CD19 expression being detected more often in childhood cases; (v) there is no cytogenetic anomaly specific for Ly+AML; anomalies exclusively associated with lymphoid malignancies were not seen; aberrations involving 11q23, 14q32, and the 9;22 translocation seem to be increased; (vi) in most studies, expression of lymphoid-associated antigens (with the exception of CD7) on AML blasts lacked prognostic significance; CD7+AML appears to be a particular subset of malignant myeloid progenitors. In summary, these findings suggest that in general, Ly+AML may not represent a biologically distinct form of leukemia as these cases have similar clinical features and respond to therapy in a comparable manner.","['Drexler, H G', 'Thiel, E', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Drexler HG', 'Thiel E', 'Ludwig WD']","['German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Antigens, Ly/*immunology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Staining and Labeling']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):489-98.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 48 different bone marrow lesions were studied immunohistochemically using a monoclonal antibody to tenascin. RESULTS: Tenascin immunoreactivity was found in lesions with increased fibrosis and high numbers of reticular fibres. The strongest immunoreactivity was found in myelofibrosis. Bone marrow from acute and chronic myeloid and lymphatic leukaemias showed weak or moderate immunoreactivity. In hyperplasias inconsistent reticular tenascin immunoreactivity was found; in normal bone marrow, only a few scattered positive fibres were occasionally seen. CONCLUSIONS: Tenascin was generally observed in conditions in which megakaryocytic hyperplasia was a feature. This is in line with the notion that tenascin synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts is stimulated by TGF-beta which is synthesised by the megakaryocytic lineage. Tenascin also contains EGF-like repeats. It might therefore function as a growth promoter and in this way could also stimulate synthesis of other matrix components. On the other hand, tenascin could function as an adhesive molecule to some cells of the bone marrow. The presence of tenascin in many pathological states of the bone marrow suggests that it may have a role in their pathogenesis and that it also could be a potential marker of disease.","['Soini, Y', 'Kamel, D', 'Apaja-Sarkkinen, M', 'Virtanen, I', 'Lehto, V P']","['Soini Y', 'Kamel D', 'Apaja-Sarkkinen M', 'Virtanen I', 'Lehto VP']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Diseases', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/*analysis', 'Extracellular Matrix/*chemistry', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia', 'Primary Myelofibrosis', 'Tenascin']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.46.3.218 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1993 Mar;46(3):218-21. doi: 10.1136/jcp.46.3.218.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Tenascin)']",,,,,PMC501173,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a preliminary observation that colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-responsive myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) from a few patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) did not respond to the costimulating effects of SLF, we evaluated responsiveness of bone marrow or blood CFU-GM from 26 patients with either AML, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to the effects in vitro of SLF and/or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). Cells from all 26 patients responded to the stimulating effects of GM-CSF, but marked heterogeneity was detected in each disease category to the costimulating effects of SLF. Nine of 13 patients with AML, 2 of 6 patients with CML and 4 of 7 patients with MDS had clonogenic cells that did not respond significantly to the costimulating effects of SLF. In a more limited study of cells from patients with MDS, it was noted that if the CFU-GM of that patient did not respond to SLF enhancement of CSF-induced colony formation, neither did the erythropoietin (Epo)-dependent erythroid (BFU-E) or multipotential (CFU-GEMM) cells of that patient (3 cases of refractory anemia [RA] evaluating bone marrow and in 1 case blood progenitors as well). If CFU-GM responded, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM responded (bone marrow from 1 patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMMol]). Clinical criteria did not readily distinguish between patients who had SLF-responsive vs. -nonresponsive clonogenic cells. While the mechanistic reason for this heterogeneity in responsiveness is not clear, these differences should be carefully considered for possible clinical trials with SLF in patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia and MDS.","['Maze, R', 'Horie, M', 'Hendrie, P', 'Vadhan-Raj, S', 'Tricot, G', 'Gordon, M', 'Nemunaitis, J', 'Ashman, L K', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Maze R', 'Horie M', 'Hendrie P', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Tricot G', 'Gordon M', 'Nemunaitis J', 'Ashman LK', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Apr;21(4):545-51.,"['R01 HL46549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL49202/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In May 1990, the leukemic cells comprised 70% of the mononuclear cells in the bone marrow and 76% of those in the peripheral blood. They consisted of a mixture of positive and negative populations, including single DAF-positive cells. In August 1990, almost 100% of the peripheral mononuclear cells were leukemic blasts, and these consisted of a single population with reduced DAF expression. Single-color flow cytometric analysis showed that the leukemic cells lacked CD59/MACIF, while control leukemic cells (n = 3) expressed both DAF and CD59/MACIF. Leukemic blasts from this patient and six control patients expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 and FcIII receptors (CD 16) both before and after treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The patient's erythrocytes lacking DAF and CD59/MACIF expression corresponded to the proportion of complement-sensitive cells at the onset of acute leukemia. These DAF- and CD59/MACIF-deficient erythrocytes disappeared almost completely with progression of the leukemia. In conclusion, it appears that the expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane proteins by leukemic cells was heterogeneous and discordant in our patient, and that the leukemic cells were derived from the PNH clone because of their deficiency of CD59/MACIF. It is also suggested that DAF could compete more effectively than CD59/MACIF for a limited number of anchor molecules available on the proliferating leukemic cells.","['Shichishima, T', 'Terasawa, T', 'Hashimoto, C', 'Ohto, H', 'Takahashi, M', 'Shibata, A', 'Maruyama, Y']","['Shichishima T', 'Terasawa T', 'Hashimoto C', 'Ohto H', 'Takahashi M', 'Shibata A', 'Maruyama Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukushima Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood/drug effects', 'CD55 Antigens', 'CD58 Antigens', 'CD59 Antigens', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*blood', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*blood/enzymology/pathology', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79196-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Apr 1;81(7):1855-62.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BM biopsies from patients with hematologic fibrogenic diseases and in cytokine-treated cancer patients are evaluated for LNGFR+ cells: the amount of stained cells is correlated with the traditional reticulin stain in cases of myelofibrosis, therapy-related myelodysplasia, leukemia, and detected an increase of stromal cells in cytokine-treated patients.

We have examined the interactions of human muscle and endothelial cells, which have been exposed to hypoxic environments, with T and B lymphoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), not subjected to hypoxia. The adhesion of B lymphocyte cell line (JY) and the adhesion of T lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat) to muscle cell monolayers that had been incubated at PO2 of 50 Torr for 3 h increased more than four- and twofold, respectively. Hypoxia appears to upregulate a saturable muscle cell-associated adhesion mechanism, which is capable of withstanding distraction forces greater than 45 g, and is inhibitable by LFA-1-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Hypoxia also induced a reciprocal decrease in lymphocyte-muscle cell adhesion mechanisms inhibitable by VCAM-1- or VLA-4-specific MAbs. Cultured human endothelial cells when subjected to hypoxic conditions also increased their adhesion for lymphoid cells and cell lines. This induction of adhesion could again be attenuated by anti-LFA-1, but not by anti-ICAM-1 MAb, suggesting that hypoxia activates an adhesion molecule on human mesenchymal cells that is likely to be a new ligand for LFA-1.

Provirus integration occurs in the last intron of the gene, leading to the expression of a truncated mRNA that terminates in the proviral long terminal repeat and encodes a protein with an altered C-terminal domain. Strong evidence that this genetic change confers growth advantage to affected cell clones was provided by the finding that, during cultivation of all three sublines derived from tumor 2769, cells were selected that harbored independent provirus insertions in the Tpl-2 locus. Exposure of normal rat spleen cells to Con A induces the expression of enhanced levels of Tpl-2 within the first 60 min from the time of exposure suggesting that, in normal splenocytes, Tpl-2 may be involved in the transition from a quiescent to the G1 phase of the cell cycle.","['Patriotis, C', 'Makris, A', 'Bear, S E', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Patriotis C', 'Makris A', 'Bear SE', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Lung/enzymology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/physiopathology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Poly A/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Spleen/enzymology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.6.2251 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Mar 15;90(6):2251-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.6.2251.,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (Map3k8 protein, rat)']",,['GENBANK/M94454'],,,PMC46064,,,,,,,,,,

T cells that have been activated via the crosslinking of CD3 are able to induce B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion in a major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted and contact-dependent manner. We find that such activated human CD4+ T cells, but not control Ig-treated T cells, may induce normal or leukemic B cells to express B7/BB1 and significantly higher levels of CD54 intercellular adhesion molecule 1 via a process that also requires direct cell-cell contact. To discern what cell surface molecule(s) may be responsible for signalling B cells to express B7/BB1, we added various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for T or B cell accessory molecules or control mAbs to cocultures of alpha-CD3-activated T cells and resting B cells. We find that only alpha-CD40 mAbs can significantly inhibit the increased expression of B7/BB1, suggesting that the ligand for CD40 expressed on activated T cells may be an important inducer of B7/BB1 expression. Subsequent experiments in fact demonstrate that alpha-CD40 mAbs, but not control mAbs, induce changes in B cell phenotype similar to those induced by activated T cells when the mAbs are presented on Fc gamma RII (CDw32)-expressing L cells. These phenotypic changes have significant effects on B cell function. Whereas chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells normally are very poor stimulators in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs), CLL-B cells preactivated via CD40 crosslinking are significantly better presenters of alloantigen, affecting up to 30-fold-greater stimulation of T cell proliferation than that induced by control treated or nontreated CLL-B cells. Similarly, the MLR of T cells stimulated by allogeneic nonleukemic B cells can be enhanced significantly if the stimulator B cells are preactivated via CD40 crosslinking. The enhanced MLR generated by such preactivated B cells may be inhibited by blocking B7/BB1-CD28 interaction with CTLA4Ig. These studies demonstrate a novel, CD40-dependent pathway for inducing B cell expression of B7/BB1 and enhancing B cell antigen-presenting cell activity that can be initiated via cell-cell contact with alpha-CD3-stimulated CD4+ T cells.","['Ranheim, E A', 'Kipps, T J']","['Ranheim EA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0663.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen', 'CD40 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.4.925 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Apr 1;177(4):925-35. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.4.925.,"['CA-49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,PMC2190967,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies indicated that CLL B cells generally express immunoglobulin (Ig) VH and VL genes with little or no somatic mutations. However, a recent report indicated that VH251, one of three VH genes belonging to the VH5 subgroup (e.g., VH251, VH32, and VH15), not only is frequently rearranged in this disease, but also has extensive and selective mutations when expressed by CLL B cells. The extent and nature of these mutations contrasts markedly from the low level of mutations noted in VH5 genes used by normal B cells or other Ig V genes found expressed in CLL. To determine whether this difference reflects a unique property of VH251 or a previously unrecognized subgroup of CLL, we examined for VH5 Ig gene rearrangements in leukemia cells from 68 patients that satisfied clinical and diagnostic criteria for CD5+ B cell CLL. Southern blot hybridization studies with probes for VH251 and the JH locus revealed that only 7 (10%) of the 68 monoclonal CLL cell populations had undergone Ig gene rearrangement involving VH5 genes. Two (3%) were found to have functionally rearranged VH5 genes that shared > or = 98% sequence homology with 5-2R1, a VH251 gene isolated from a pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The other five CLL (7%) had functionally rearranged VH5 genes that each shared > or = 99% nucleic acid sequence homology with a germline VH32 isolated from human sperm DNA. These data indicate that VH251 or VH32 also may be expressed by CD5+ CLL B cells with little or no somatic mutation. These findings contrast with a recently published study on VH5 gene expression in B CLL and contest the hypothesis that extensive somatic mutation is a common property of the VH5 genes used in this disease. Further work to define the clinical and/or phenotypic characteristics of patients with leukemia cells that express mutated versus nonmutated Ig V genes may reveal subsets of CLL that possibly differ in their cytogenesis, etiopathogenesis, and/or clinical behavior.","['Rassenti, L Z', 'Kipps, T J']","['Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0663.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD5 Antigens', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.4.1039 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Apr 1;177(4):1039-46. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.4.1039.,"['AG-04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,['V<down>H</down>5'],,PMC2190987,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, broad spectrum antiviral activity has been demonstrated for both recombinant and naturally occurring IFN alpha. Hepatitis C is responsive to IFN alpha in about 40% of patients, but long term remissions are rare. In contrast, long term suppression of hepatitis B is common following IFN alpha therapy. Both diseases respond in a dose proportional fashion, with daily doses of 5 million units (MU) significantly more effective than lower doses. The mechanism of action in viral diseases involves the expression of unique antiviral proteins such as endonuclease and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase which enhance the destruction of viral RNA. General cellular protein synthesis is also inhibited, including cytochrome P450 enzymes. This forms the basis for potential drug interactions, with IFN alpha slowing the clearance of highly metabolised drugs such as theophylline. As an antitumour agent, the mechanism of action of IFN alpha is unclear, particularly in haematological cancers. In melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, antitumour effects may be mediated by augmented immune responses including activation of natural killer lymphocytes and enhanced expression of cell surface antigens (e.g. MHC I and II). Conversely, antibody formation to recombinant IFN alpha may result in a loss of activity. This has been observed in both renal cell cancer and hepatitis B and C. The elimination half-life of IFN alpha is short, 4 to 5 hours, but biological activity extends for 2 to 3 days after administration, which facilitates daily or thrice weekly administration. Clearance of IFN alpha is mediated by catabolism in the renal tubules; no intact drug is excreted in the urine. It is probable that the antiviral indications of IFN alpha will expand as the agent is more clearly recognised as a primary endogenous defence against various viral conditions.","['Dorr, R T']",['Dorr RT'],"['College of Medicine, Pharmacology Department, University of Arizona, Tucson.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hepatitis B/therapy', 'Hepatitis C/therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Virus Diseases/*therapy']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199345020-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1993 Feb;45(2):177-211. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199345020-00003.,,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One who had had pelvic radiation as well as chemotherapy had a prolonged, gradual but complete recovery. One who received granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) following PBSC infusion showed a rapid recovery phase, but developed high fever (culture negative) associated with arrested hematopoiesis and died with central nervous system (CNS) symptoms after 120 days. Two other patients recovered without major incident. Concentration of PBSC was analyzed by: (1) approximation by counting mononuclear cells (MNC); (2) CD34 cells by flow cytometric analysis; and (3) colony forming units-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) by colony formation in microtiter plates. The time to BM recovery (retics > 1.0 percent, neutrophils > 500 per cumm, platelets > 50,000 per cumm) was determined by following daily counts. Engraftment appeared to depend upon an adequate minimum dose of PBSC, but ultimate recovery of the patient seemed to be determined by ancillary factors, especially CNS infection. These patients illustrate that while rapidity of bone marrow (BM) recovery may be related to PBSC dose, other factors, particularly infection, influence patient outcome.","['Morse, E E', 'Tuck, D', 'Ascensao, J', 'Sorba, S', 'Dainiak, N']","['Morse EE', 'Tuck D', 'Ascensao J', 'Sorba S', 'Dainiak N']","['University of Connecticut Health Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Farmington 06030.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocytes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Reticulocytes/pathology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1993 Mar-Apr;23(2):89-96.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell lines not normally responsive to CNTF responded to treatment with a combination of CNTF and a soluble form of the CNTF alpha receptor component. These findings not only demonstrate that the CNTF receptor alpha chain is a required component of the functional CNTF receptor complex but also reveal that it can function in soluble form as part of a heterodimeric ligand.

The characteristics of Ag presentation of influenza nucleoprotein expressed in an AroA- strain of Salmonella typhimurium (SL3262-pNP-2) have therefore been compared with those of soluble purified nucleoprotein (NP) and infectious influenza virus. This represents three distinct modes of internalization of the same protein into APC. Human monocytes and the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 infected with SL3261-pNP-2 were found to present several different epitopes from NP to human CD4+ class II-restricted T lymphocytes. Ag presentation to these T cell clones was enhanced by pretreatment of THP-1 cells with IFN-gamma but not TNF-alpha. Bacterial phagocytosis and Ag presentation of NP were increased after opsonization of Salmonella with immune serum. Macrophages infected with SL3261-pNP-2 were unable to present NP to class I-restricted T cells. In contrast, cells infected with live influenza virus, although recognized by NP-specific class I-restricted CTL, were inefficiently recognized by NP-specific class II-restricted T cells. Ag presentation to CD4+ T cell clones by monocytes of SL3261-pNP-2, purified recombinant NP, and live influenza virus, but not the synthetic peptide 206-229, was inhibited by chloroquine and the protease inhibitors pepstatin A and leupeptin, suggesting that the major route of processing in each case was via the exogenous pathway. T cell recognition of NP via all of these Ag delivery systems was also abrogated by cycloheximide and brefeldin A treatment, indicating a requirement for recently synthesized MHC class II molecules in presentation of whole NP after processing but not for the corresponding synthetic peptide.","['Brett, S J', 'Rhodes, J', 'Liew, F Y', 'Tite, J P']","['Brett SJ', 'Rhodes J', 'Liew FY', 'Tite JP']","['Department of Cell Biology, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase', '*Alkyl and Aryl Transferases', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*immunology', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Kinetics', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins', 'Nucleoproteins/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Salmonella typhimurium/genetics/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Core Proteins/*immunology', 'Virulence']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Apr 1;150(7):2869-84.,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (NP protein, Influenza A virus)', '0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.19 (3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A minority of B1 and Alu sequences are expressed as small cytoplasmic RNAs. These RNAs have conserved a secondary structure motif also present in signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA despite substantial sequence divergence, whereas random B1 and Alu sequences have not. This RNA structure has also been conserved by the source sequences that gave rise to successive transpositions during B1 and Alu evolution. In the present work small cytoplasmic B1 and Alu RNAs synthesized in vitro were found to bind a cellular protein by mobility shift and UV cross-linking analyses. The mouse and human proteins demonstrate the same specificity to a panel of competitor RNAs. Results using mutated B1 RNA indicate that a single strand loop in the conserved Alu motif is essential for binding. Previous work by Strub et al. (Stub, K., Moss, J. B., and Walter, P. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 3949-3959) demonstrated that the Alu-specific protein SRP 9/14 does not footprint to this region of SRP RNA. This observation coupled with the failure of anti-SRP/9 antibodies to identify SRP 9/14 in the B1 RNA-protein complex as well as the apparent mass and other characteristics of the protein described here suggest that it is a novel B1-Alu RNA-binding protein. Conservation of primary and secondary structure by B1 and Alu small cytoplasmic RNAs as well as features of their specific expression and ability to interact with the conserved binding protein indicate that these RNAs are more homologous than previously appreciated.","['Chang, D Y', 'Maraia, R J']","['Chang DY', 'Maraia RJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Recognition Particle', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/25 00:00,1993/03/25 00:01,['1993/03/25 00:00'],"['1993/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53269-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 25;268(9):6423-8.,,"['0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Signal Recognition Particle)', '0 (Srp72 protein, mouse)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we used site-directed mutagenesis to define the sequence features of the polypurine tract (PPT) required for correct plus strand priming by the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase (Rattray, A. J., and Champoux, J. J. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 208, 445-456). Although the sequences of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and M-MuLV diverge completely outside a 20-base region encompassing the PPT, within this region there are only three differences between the two viruses. Here we show that the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase will utilize the M-MuLV PPT as an origin for plus strand initiation in vitro. This finding enabled us to use the set of PPT mutants previously generated in M-MuLV, in conjunction with a small set of newly derived mutations within the HIV-1 PPT, to study plus strand priming by the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Despite the similarity between the two PPT regions, the sequence features important for positioning RNase H for the cleavage reaction that generates the plus strand primer are different for the two viruses. For M-MuLV, the -7A residue is a critical specificity determinant in the priming reaction, whereas for HIV-1, the -2G and -4G residues play key roles in determining the specificity of priming.","['Pullen, K A', 'Rattray, A J', 'Champoux, J J']","['Pullen KA', 'Rattray AJ', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Purines/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1993/03/25 00:00,1993/03/25 00:01,['1993/03/25 00:00'],"['1993/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53242-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 25;268(9):6221-7.,['CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two HIV RTs were less accurate than MLV RT. The mispair extension frequencies observed previously with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) template were higher than those detected with phi X174am3 DNA template with all three RTs. In the current study we have investigated whether the nature of the copied nucleic acid (RNA vs. DNA) or the template nucleotide sequences affect the accuracy of DNA synthesis. We have analyzed the fidelity of DNA synthesis with DNA sequences identical to those of the rRNA sequences previously employed for reverse transcription. The results indicate that the fidelity of DNA synthesis depends mainly on the nucleotide sequences copied by every given RT. Yet, fidelity of DNA synthesis depends not only on the sequences copied but also on the nature of the enzymes per se.

Here we describe the molecular cloning and characterisation of two murine telomere-like sequences, one having an inverted repeat structure and the other a simple tandem repeat organisation. The inverted telomere repeat clone generates an in situ chromosome 2 hybridisation pattern very similar to the distribution of the radiation-sensitive fragile sites previously found to be associated with leukaemogenic initiation. Furthermore, statistical comparison of the distributions of radiation induced breakpoints and sites of inverted telomere repeat hybridization indicates concordance at all chromosome 2 sites excluding the terminal regions. These data are discussed with respect to mechanisms of radiation-induced, site-specific chromosome 2 rearrangement and their implications for leukaemogenic initiation.","['Bouffler, S', 'Silver, A', 'Papworth, D', 'Coates, J', 'Cox, R']","['Bouffler S', 'Silver A', 'Papworth D', 'Coates J', 'Cox R']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Didcot, Oxon, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites', '*Chromosome Fragility', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.2870060206 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993 Feb;6(2):98-106. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870060206.,,,,"['GENBANK/L11593', 'GENBANK/L11594', 'GENBANK/L24529', 'GENBANK/S56761', 'GENBANK/S56762', 'GENBANK/S56763', 'GENBANK/S56879', 'GENBANK/S56880', 'GENBANK/Z15047', 'GENBANK/Z15048']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This involved incubation of cells with [5-3H]ICI D1694, extraction of the polyglutamates and their analysis by HPLC using an ion-pairing method. Co-chromatography with ICI D1694 and its synthetic di-hexaglutamate standards (UV detection) aided identification of the [3H]polyglutamates in the fractions recovered from the HPLC. Recovery of the polyglutamates at each stage of extraction and analysis was very good (77-84% overall recovery). Polyglutamates readily accumulated as the tri-, tetra and penta forms and occasionally a small amount of hexaglutamate was found. After mouse L1210 leukemia or human W1L2 lymphoblastoid cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.1 microM [3H]ICI D1694 there was a approximately 6-fold concentration effect intracellularly with most of the 3H associated with polyglutamate forms (approximately 75% and 96% for the L1210 and W1L2, respectively). Even some of the higher chain length tetra- and pentaglutamates could be detected at this time. After 4 hr incubation the total level of intracellular 3H had risen to 2-3 microM, greater than 96% of which was associated with polyglutamates (mainly tetra- and pentaglutamates). Four other human cell lines, two ovarian (CH1 and 41M), the MCF-7 breast and the HT-29 colon, were examined for their ability to form intracellular polyglutamates. A 4 hr incubation with 0.1 microM [3H]ICI D1694 resulted in a substantial intracellular accumulation of the drug (20-100-fold) in its polyglutamate forms with only 2-20% remaining as the parent monoglutamate, depending on the cell line. The major polyglutamate was again cell line dependent, ranging from the tri to the penta form. Prolonging the incubation time to 24 hr allowed a further accumulation of drug with a larger percentage appearing as tri- to hexaglutamates. Although cell lines differed in the total level of polyglutamates formed and the pattern of chain length observed, rapid and extensive polyglutamation of ICI D1694 occurred in all the cell types examined.","['Gibson, W', 'Bisset, G M', 'Marsham, P R', 'Kelland, L R', 'Judson, I R', 'Jackman, A L']","['Gibson W', 'Bisset GM', 'Marsham PR', 'Kelland LR', 'Judson IR', 'Jackman AL']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Polyglutamic Acid/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/02/24 00:00,1993/02/24 00:01,['1993/02/24 00:00'],"['1993/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90170-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90170-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Feb 24;45(4):863-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90170-2.,,"['0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of G-CSFR in transfected clones was demonstrated by northern blotting, binding of [125I]rhG-CSF and cross-linking experiments. A high level of expression of the G-CSFR did not promote or suppress cellular proliferation or initiate differentiation; however, exposure of transfected cells to G-CSF in suspension culture caused a large percentage of the population to enter a differentiation pathway, as determined by two markers of the mature state, the ability of cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and to express the differentiation antigen Mac-1 (CD11b) on the cell surface. Thus, upon treatment with 10 ng/ml of G-CSF, 60% or more of transfected cells exhibited NBT positivity; whereas, in contrast, nontransfected cells exhibited only 6% NBT positivity in response to G-CSF. An eightfold increase in Mac-1 expression over that of the parental line was also observed in transfected cells exposed to G-CSF. The growth rate of the transfected clones was decreased by exposure to G-CSF, presumably due to terminal differentiation. The findings suggest that the predominant function of G-CSF and its receptor in WEHI-3B D+ cells is to mediate differentiation and that the level of the G-CSFR portion of the signal transduction mechanism in this malignant cell line is important for a response to the maturation inducing function of the cytokine.","['Li, J', 'Koay, D C', 'Xiao, H', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Li J', 'Koay DC', 'Xiao H', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cadmium Chloride', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.120.6.1481 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1993 Mar;120(6):1481-9. doi: 10.1083/jcb.120.6.1481.,,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",,,,,PMC2119760,,,,,,,,,,

(Partanen, J., Makela, T. P., Eerola, E., Korhonen, J., Hirvonen, H., Claesson, W. L., and Alitalo, K.

Its amino acid sequence is identical to that of cl44 with the exception of 1 residue. The 5'-untranslated sequences of the two cDNAs diverged far upstream of the initiation codon. A myoblast line, L6E9, which lacks FGF receptors, was utilized to express high levels of FGFR4. We found, in contrast to Partenen et al., who reported only binding of acidic FGF, that FGFR4 bound both acidic and basic FGF with dissociation constants of 10-15 and 120 pM, respectively. No detectable binding of keratinocyte growth factor was observed. In studies aimed to determine whether FGF receptors contribute to the development of human tumors, we screened RNAs prepared from cell lines derived from a variety of solid tumors. High levels of the cl44 transcript were detected in 8 of 14 and 6 of 9 human mammary and kidney carcinomas, respectively, but only infrequently in other types of tumors. In contrast, FGFR1 was found to be frequently expressed in kidney, but not in breast tumor cells, suggesting a possible role for FGFR4 in human mammary cancer.","['Ron, D', 'Reich, R', 'Chedid, M', 'Lengel, C', 'Cohen, O E', 'Chan, A M', 'Neufeld, G', 'Miki, T', 'Tronick, S R']","['Ron D', 'Reich R', 'Chedid M', 'Lengel C', 'Cohen OE', 'Chan AM', 'Neufeld G', 'Miki T', 'Tronick SR']","['Department of Biology, Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 10', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7', '*Fibroblast Growth Factors', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53334-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Mar 15;268(8):5388-94.,,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (FGF7 protein, human)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 10)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,"['GENBANK/M58051', 'GENBANK/M80634', 'GENBANK/X52833', 'GENBANK/X58255']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The APO-1 antigen was found to be expressed on the surface of malignant B cells. In BCLL cells from most patients, APO-1 antigen expression increased following in vitro activation by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) or interleukin-2 (IL-2). In certain cases of BCLL co-stimulation with SAC plus IL-2 resulted in a synergistic up-regulation of the APO-1 antigen on the cell surface and prepared BCLL cells for monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, bcl-2 mRNA expression decreased upon stimulation with SAC plus IL-2, whereas SAC or IL-2 alone did not affect the level of bcl-2 expression. Thus, in these BCLL cells induction of anti-APO-1-mediated apoptosis appeared to be correlated with bcl-2 mRNA down-regulation. One informative BCLL, however, with a similar pattern of APO-1-antigen expression, did not show SAC plus IL-2-dependent bcl-2 down-regulation. Surprisingly, these cells proliferated in response to anti-APO-1 only when cells were co-stimulated with SAC plus IL-2. Our data suggest that down-regulation of bcl-2 prepares BCLL cells for induction of APO-1-mediated apoptosis. In addition they demonstrate that triggering of the APO-1 antigen may also lead to the induction of proliferation in special cases of BCLL.","['Mapara, M Y', 'Bargou, R', 'Zugck, C', 'Dohner, H', 'Ustaoglu, F', 'Jonker, R R', 'Krammer, P H', 'Dorken, B']","['Mapara MY', 'Bargou R', 'Zugck C', 'Dohner H', 'Ustaoglu F', 'Jonker RR', 'Krammer PH', 'Dorken B']","['Robert Rossle Klinik, Max Delbruck Centrum fur Molekulare Medizin, Universitats Klinikum Rudolf Virchow-Freie Universitat Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*physiology', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830230320 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1993 Mar;23(3):702-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830230320.,,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concentration of each antileukemic agent producing 50% cytotoxicity (LC50) was determined for each patient by fitting a sigmoid model to the drug concentrations versus percentage viability data. Clinically relevant drug concentrations produced cytotoxic effects, and ALL blast sensitivity varied considerably among patients. We conclude that this is an informative method of systematically evaluating drug sensitivity in ALL patients.","['Campana, D', 'Manabe, A', 'Evans, W E']","['Campana D', 'Manabe A', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Mar;7(3):482-8.,"['P01-CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal counterparts of these double-positive cells are rare in bone marrow (BM) (< 0.03%; if they occur at all) and are not detectable in peripheral blood (PB). In 14 patients with TdT+ AML at diagnosis, we have performed a prospective follow-up study to monitor the myeloid-marker+, TdT+ cells during and after chemotherapy. One patient did not obtain complete remission (CR), a second patient relapsed under therapy, whereas the other 12 patients were in cytomorphological CR at the end of chemotherapy. During subsequent follow-up, seven of these 12 patients developed one or two relapses (total of ten relapses). Nine of these ten relapses were preceded by a gradual increase of myeloid-marker+, TdT+ cells in BM and PB samples over a period of 14-38 weeks. Based on comparable results in BM and PB samples and doubling times of 15-20 days, we propose that monitoring of AML patients should include PB sampling each 4-6 weeks. In one patient the relapse was not preceded by a gradual increase of double-positive cells. This false negative result was caused by a phenotypic shift, since at relapse the AML cells did not express TdT. In the five AML patients who still are in continuous cytomorphological CR for 32-46 months we repeatedly detected relatively high percentages of myeloid-marker+, TdT+ cells in BM (up to 0.1%) and PB (up to 0.02%). Although we could not prove the leukemic origin of these double-positive cells, they might represent residual dysplastic AML cells which survived chemotherapy but which are not capable of causing leukemia regrowth as yet. This would be in line with recent polymerase chain reaction studies, which could demonstrate the persistence of leukemic clones in the majority of AML patients in continuous CR. It is concluded that double immunofluorescence labeling for myeloid markers and TdT is useful for detection of residual disease in TdT+ AML patients. A gradual increase of double-positive cells is suggestive for leukemic cell growth and can be used to predict relapse.","['Adriaansen, H J', 'Jacobs, B C', 'Kappers-Klunne, M C', 'Hahlen, K', 'Hooijkaas, H', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Adriaansen HJ', 'Jacobs BC', 'Kappers-Klunne MC', 'Hahlen K', 'Hooijkaas H', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*enzymology/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Mar;7(3):472-81.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two recently characterized human homeobox-containing genes, HB9 and HB24, are known to be expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and to be involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of progenitor cells to mature hematopoietic cell types. In this study, elevated levels of HB24 and HB9 mRNA expression were detected in bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with acute myelogenous or acute lymphocytic leukemia. While the levels of both mRNAs were elevated in all the patients with acute leukemias, the levels of HB9 mRNA were more variable than those of HB24. Immunohistochemical analysis utilizing an HB24 polyclonal antiserum demonstrated elevated levels of HB24 protein in cytopreparations of acute leukemic cells. Nuclear run-on experiments showed that the increases of HB9 and HB24 mRNA transcripts in patients' cells were, at least in part, secondary to increased transcription. The expression of HB9 and HB24 correlated with the clinical status of the patient. No significant level of expression of either HB9 or HB24 was detected in PBMC isolated from patients in remission. In contrast to the findings with cells isolated from patients with acute leukemias, no significant increase in either HB9 or HB24 transcript levels were found in cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic or chronic myelogenous leukemia when compared to normal controls. These findings demonstrate that high levels of HB9 and HB24 expression are common features of acute leukemia and suggest the possibility that the dysregulated expression of these two genes may contribute to leukemogenesis. However, since these two genes are markers of immature hematopoietic cells they may not have an etiologic role in leukemogenesis.","['Deguchi, Y', 'Yamanaka, Y', 'Theodossiou, C', 'Najfeld, V', 'Kehrl, J H']","['Deguchi Y', 'Yamanaka Y', 'Theodossiou C', 'Najfeld V', 'Kehrl JH']","['Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/physiology', 'Poly A/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'RNA/genetics', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Mar;7(3):446-51.,,"['24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",,,"['HB24', 'HB9']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MGF stimulated DNA synthesis of purified leukemic blasts in eight out of 10 cases and colony formation in four cases in serum-free (SF) culture. MGF synergized with interleukin-3 (IL-3; four out of 10 cases), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; three out of 10 cases), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; six out of 10 cases), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; one out of 10 cases) and erythropoietin (EPO; one out of 10 cases) when added to culture in combination. Synergistic effects of MGF in combination with other CSFs were also seen in the colony assay. Antibodies against GM-CSF, M-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-6 did not inhibit the MGF response, suggesting that the stimulative effect of MGF was not mediated through autocrine release of those cytokines. Cell recovery data in liquid cultures that contained MGF, IL-3, or MGF + IL-3, indicated that both MGF and IL-3 augmented the maintenance of clonogenic cells as compared to nonsupplemented cultures, but the effect of the combination of IL-3 + MGF did not show synergy. In contrast, activation of DNA synthesis by MGF was abrogated in the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF; four out of 10 cases) and interleukin-4 (IL-4; two out of 10 cases). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with anti c-kit antibodies revealed MGF receptor expression in eight out of nine cases, often in a subpopulation of the cells. Scatchard analysis of MGF receptors in two cases indicated the presence of 1460 and 41,500 (mean) binding sites, respectively, of high affinity (Kd 40-160 pmol/l). The MGF dose-response curve in the presence of IL-3 or GM-CSF resulted in a higher plateau of DNA synthesis, however no shift in the dose response was apparent. The respective reciprocal dose response relations to GM-CSF, IL-3, or G-CSF were similarly elevated when MGF was added. MGF did not alter IL-3 and GM-CSF receptor expression, nor did IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, TNF, or IL-4 influence MGF binding to AML cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Budel, L M', 'Delwel, R', 'van Buitenen, C', 'Hoogerbrugge, H', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Budel LM', 'Delwel R', 'van Buitenen C', 'Hoogerbrugge H', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/immunology/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/drug effects/physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Mar;7(3):426-34.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The magnitude of T-TIL response in biopsy specimens from patients with B-cell lymphoma has been suggested as an independent predictor of clinical outcome. Since recognition of tumor antigens may occur in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, effective T-TIL tumor immunosurveillance may be limited by either failure to express MHC-encoded recognition structures and/or host T-cell immunocompetence. To further delineate T-cell immunoregulation in B-cell lymphoma, we assessed T-TIL fraction and tumor expression of invariant class I and class II HLA determinants by immunohistochemistry in biopsy specimens. Two distinct clinical cohorts of B-cell lymphoma were investigated to delineate pathogenetic differences in T-TIL response. One group, representing immunodeficient and transplant-related lymphomas, comprised 18 patients with AIDS- or allograft-related lymphoma. The second group comprised 83 consecutive cases of sporadic diffuse large cell (DLCL) lymphoma. Median CD8+ T-TIL was significantly lower (4.9% versus 12.7%) among immunodeficiency-associated lymphoma and the frequency of cases with low (< 6%) CD8+ T-TIL greater (76% versus 23%) (p < 0.0001). None of the immunodeficiency-associated lymphomas demonstrated non-polymorphic HLA loss. Absence of one or more class I or II HLA determinants was found in 13 out of 19 (68%) sporadic DLCL specimens with low CD8+ T-TIL, compared to 20% of cases with higher T-TIL fraction (p = 0.0004). These findings implicate impaired host immunosurveillance in deficient T-TIL response in immunodeficiency-associated B-cell lymphoma, whereas low T-TIL in sporadic cases of DLCL relates to tumor loss of HLA determinants. Strategies to modulate tumor HLA expression or augment antitumor response merit investigation in patients with B-cell lymphoma.","['List, A F', 'Spier, C M', 'Miller, T P', 'Grogan, T M']","['List AF', 'Spier CM', 'Miller TP', 'Grogan TM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence/*immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Mar;7(3):398-403.,"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV-infected control animals and those animals receiving VV-BLV1 were slower to develop antibodies postchallenge, and the titers of anti-gp51 antibodies continued to increase over 16 months. Proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction in the four groups at 6 weeks after challenge. However, it could not be detected 4 months postinfection in the VV groups inoculated with complete env. Provirus was present in the VV-BLV1 and control groups over the 16-month trial period. These results demonstrate that vaccination with VV recombinants containing the complete env gene of BLV protects sheep against infection and that protection correlated with a CD4 T-cell response to a defined epitope.","['Gatei, M H', 'Naif, H M', 'Kumar, S', 'Boyle, D B', 'Daniel, R C', 'Good, M F', 'Lavin, M F']","['Gatei MH', 'Naif HM', 'Kumar S', 'Boyle DB', 'Daniel RC', 'Good MF', 'Lavin MF']","['Queensland Cancer Fund Research Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Bancroft Centre, Brisbane.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, pol', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*prevention & control', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/*prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.4.1803-1810.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Apr;67(4):1803-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.4.1803-1810.1993.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",,,"['env', 'pol']",,PMC240230,,,,,,,,,,

Cell-mediated immune mechanisms may play a major role in protection against BLV infection. We describe here for the first time the identification of proliferative (CD4) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CD8) epitopes of the gp51 envelope (env) protein of BLV. This protein and a recombinant form expressed by a vaccinia virus construct have been shown to be potential vaccine candidates. A complete series of overlapping peptides, 20 amino acids in length, was prepared to identify epitopes from gp51. These peptides were tested for the ability to elicit peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in infected and uninfected cattle and sheep. Peptides 51-70 and 61-80 produced a proliferative response in lymphocytes from only uninfected animals (both sheep and cattle), and this was shown by T-cell subset deletion to be a CD4-mediated response. Seven BLV-infected sheep did not show a response to either peptide. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, however, was associated only with peptides 121-140 and 131-150. In this case, the response was demonstrated to be CD8 dependent and was found only in BLV-infected animals (sheep). Knowledge of the location of these T-cell recognition domains will complement data available on B-cell epitopes in gp51 and may be useful in the design of a subunit vaccine.","['Gatei, M H', 'Good, M F', 'Daniel, R C', 'Lavin, M F']","['Gatei MH', 'Good MF', 'Daniel RC', 'Lavin MF']","['Queensland Cancer Fund Research Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Bancroft Centre, Herston, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Sheep', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*immunology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.4.1796-1802.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Apr;67(4):1796-802. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.4.1796-1802.1993.,,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,['env'],,PMC240227,,,,,,,,,,

Among IgG subclasses, the IgG1 and IgG3 responses were directed against both the gag (p53, p24, p19, and Gag-1a) and env (recombinant MTA-1, r21e, and synthetic Env-1, Env-5) proteins; IgG2 responses were mainly restricted to gag proteins. The frequency profile of HTLV-I-specific antigen recognition in all four IgG subclasses were similar in all of the clinical groups. These results further define the fine specificity of anti-HTLV-I immune reaction for understanding the mechanism of pathogenesis in these individuals and suggest that factors other than the humoral immune responses may be associated with the clinical manifestation of the disease.","['Lal, R B', 'Buckner, C', 'Khabbaz, R F', 'Kaplan, J E', 'Reyes, G', 'Hadlock, K', 'Lipka, J', 'Foung, S K', 'Chan, L', 'Coligan, J E']","['Lal RB', 'Buckner C', 'Khabbaz RF', 'Kaplan JE', 'Reyes G', 'Hadlock K', 'Lipka J', 'Foung SK', 'Chan L', 'Coligan JE']","['Retrovirus Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia 30333.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/blood/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*classification', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122983710433 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1993.1043 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1993 Apr;67(1):40-9. doi: 10.1006/clin.1993.1043.,"['DA-06596/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-33811/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of anti-B4-blocked ricin in vivo was assessed in survival models of SCID mice bearing either a human B-cell lymphoma (Namalwa), a human non-T and non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Nalm-6), or a murine B-cell lymphoma transfected with the human CD19 gene (300B4). In one model, 5 x 10(7) tumor cells were injected i.p., and 1 h later the mice were treated with i.v. bolus injections of anti-B4-blocked ricin at 100 micrograms/kg/day for 5 days. Controls included similar treatment with anti-B4 antibody (72 micrograms/kg/day or 2 mg/kg/day for 5 days) alone or with the isotype-matched nonspecific immunotoxin, N901-blocked ricin (100 micrograms/kg/day). In a second model, 4 x 10(6) tumor cells were injected i.v., and 7 days later mice were treated i.v. as above. Anti-B4-blocked ricin showed efficacy by killing in vivo up to 3 logs of tumor cells, which was manifested in significant prolongation of the life of the treated animals. Only very limited or no effects were observed in animals treated with either anti-B4 antibody alone or N901-blocked ricin control conjugate. The concentration of anti-B4-blocked ricin in the blood of animals was 150 ng/ml after the first i.v. injection and about 800 ng/ml following the fifth injection of conjugate. This increase may be due to damage to the reticuloendothelial system by anti-B4-blocked ricin, since the rate of clearance of carbon from blood also decreased 5-fold after five injections as compared to the rate after only one injection. These studies indicate that anti-B4-blocked ricin has the potential to increase survival times of hosts with malignant disease.","['Shah, S A', 'Halloran, P M', 'Ferris, C A', 'Levine, B A', 'Bourret, L A', 'Goldmacher, V S', 'Blattler, W A']","['Shah SA', 'Halloran PM', 'Ferris CA', 'Levine BA', 'Bourret LA', 'Goldmacher VS', 'Blattler WA']","['ImmunoGen, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139-4239.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phagocytosis', 'Ricin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Mar 15;53(6):1360-7.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They separated the blood into a myeloid-rich fraction and a fraction containing the malignant lymphocytes. JH and bcr probes were used to study these loci in the myeloid and lymphoid fractions and in unfractionated white blood cells. The authors found that the unfractionated leukocytes contained the bcr and JH rearrangements. Conversely, the lymphoid fraction contained only the JH rearrangement, and the myeloid fraction contained only the bcr rearrangement, suggesting that these malignancies arose from separate stem cells.

Stably determined preadipocyte and myoblast cell lines were established after a brief exposure of 10T1/2 cells to 5-azacytidine. These cell lines terminally differentiated into adipocytes and myotubes, respectively, under appropriate conditions. The hematopoiesis-supporting ability of each 10T1/2-derived cell line was examined by coculture with FACS-sorted murine hematopoietic stem cells (Thy-1lo c-kit+ Lin-). The number of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) was slightly reduced after 7 days of culture with parent 10T1/2 fibroblasts, whereas a marked increase in CFU-GM number was observed when the cells were cultured on preadipocytes. Mature adipocytes and myogenically determined cell lines, on the other hand, did not support CFU-GM growth. Further, Northern analysis showed that the preadipocyte cell line acquired the ability to produce a significant amount of stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNAs in response to IL-1 or lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Terminal adipocytic differentiation resulted in reduced ability to express these cytokine mRNAs. Similarly, highest IL-6 activity was detected in the supernatant of preadipocyte culture, whereas adipocytes did not secrete IL-6 even after IL-1 stimulation. Interestingly, hematopoiesis-nonsupporting myoblasts and myotubes also expressed abundant SCF mRNA, suggesting that SCF, per se, may not be sufficient for stem cell growth and survival. The 10T1/2-derived cell lines could provide a valuable tool to aid in the analysis of stromal cell development and the search for novel stromal factors.","['Nishikawa, M', 'Ozawa, K', 'Tojo, A', 'Yoshikubo, T', 'Okano, A', 'Tani, K', 'Ikebuchi, K', 'Nakauchi, H', 'Asano, S']","['Nishikawa M', 'Ozawa K', 'Tojo A', 'Yoshikubo T', 'Okano A', 'Tani K', 'Ikebuchi K', 'Nakauchi H', 'Asano S']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85451-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 1;81(5):1184-92.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a murine amphotropic retrovirus vector containing an interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) gene as a reporter and a neomycin phosphotransferase (neor) gene as a dominant selectable marker, we measured the efficiency of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and the stability of transduced gene expression in a cystic fibrosis tracheal epithelial cell line (CFT1). The use of the IL-2R cell surface marker as a reporter of infection permitted both quantitation of vector gene expression and flow cytometric sorting of cells transduced with the vector. In initial studies, the optimal conditions for retrovirus-mediated gene transfer were determined. The presence of a polycation was required for optimal transduction efficiency. The efficiency of infection of CFT1 cells was increased by repetitive exposure to virus such that it was possible to transduce approximately 80% of the cells following three successive daily exposures. The long-term stability of expression of the non-selected IL-2R gene was also evaluated. A slow decline in the percentage of cells expressing IL-2R was seen with cells that were maintained under constant selection pressure for expression of the neor gene, which was expressed from an internal promoter. Similar results were obtained when cultures were selected initially for neor gene expression and maintained without selection thereafter. In contrast, stable expression was observed in CFT1 cells for at least one year following multiple infections in the absence of G418 selection. In conclusion, (i) transduction of foreign genes into human airway epithelial cells using an amphotropic retrovirus vector can be highly efficient in the presence of appropriate polycations and multiple exposures; and (ii) stable expression of a non-selected gene in these epithelial cells is better maintained without selection.","['Olsen, J C', 'Johnson, L G', 'Wong-Sun, M L', 'Moore, K L', 'Swanstrom, R', 'Boucher, R C']","['Olsen JC', 'Johnson LG', 'Wong-Sun ML', 'Moore KL', 'Swanstrom R', 'Boucher RC']","['UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cystic Fibrosis/*genetics', 'Epithelial Cells', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Trachea/cytology/*metabolism', '*Transfection']",1993/02/11 00:00,1993/02/11 00:01,['1993/02/11 00:00'],"['1993/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/21.3.663 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Feb 11;21(3):663-9. doi: 10.1093/nar/21.3.663.,"['HL42834/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL47121/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",,,"['IL-2R', 'neo<up>r</up>']",,PMC309167,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrated that cells at the G1/S border were more efficiently induced to differentiate by short exposure to RA than cells at other phases of the cell cycle. Synchronization of cells in G1/S phase by aphidicolin (APH) or mimosine (MIMO) increased the sensitivity of cells to RA short exposure treatment. Pretreatment with sphinganine (SP), a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, potentiated RA-induced cell differentiation. By cell cycle analysis, SP was found to block the cell progression through the G1/S phase. Consequently, cells accumulated in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. The present data therefore suggest a possible mechanism of action of SP to enhance RA-induced differentiation.","['Hui, E K', 'Yung, B Y']","['Hui EK', 'Yung BY']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chang Gung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mimosine/pharmacology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(93)80020-U [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(93)80020-u [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1993 Mar 1;318(2):193-9. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(93)80020-u.,,"['38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '500-44-7 (Mimosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some leukemia cells also express the sialyl Le(x) antigen, and in such a case, the sialyl Le(x)/ELAM-1 adhesion system will be involved in the organ infiltration of leukemia cells. On the other hand, in the adhesion of human cancer cells to endothelial cells, another carbohydrate antigen, sialyl Le(a), serves as the ligand for ELAM-1, as well as sialyl Le(x). These two carbohydrate determinants, sialyl Le(a) and sialyl Le(a), on cancer cells will be involved in the hematogenous metastasis of cancer cells. The physiological function of these two carbohydrate determinants at the surface of normal epithelial cells is most probably to mediate stage-specific cell-to-cell recognition and adhesion during the course of organogenesis in developing embryos, and the abnormal cell-adhesion behaviors of cancer cells are the results of aberrant expression of cell adhesion molecules which would play physiologically important roles under normal condition.","['Kannagi, R']",['Kannagi R'],"['Dept. of Experimental Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Seventy-three patients who did not meet diagnostic criteria for a small-cell lymphoid neoplasm (SCLN) and 11 patients with SCLN had, on marrow particle preparations: (1) at least three lymphoid aggregates and (2) suitable material available for immunoperoxidase studies with monoclonal antibodies UCHL-1 (CD45RO, pan T cell) and L-26 (CD20, pan B cell). Staining with UCHL-1 was difficult to interpret due to high background positivity in myeloid elements. With L-26, three distinct patterns of lymphocyte marking were identified within aggregates: (1) homogeneous--uniform marking of almost all lymphocytes; (2) mixed--even distribution of marking and nonmarking lymphocytes; (3) and focal homogeneous--collections of uniformly marking lymphocytes either surrounding or surrounded by nonmarking lymphocytes. A homogeneous marking pattern was the predominant pattern in 8 of 11 patients (73%) with SCLN. Only 6 of 73 patients without overt SCLN marked in a homogeneous pattern, and these were always associated with aggregates with other staining patterns. All patients with apparently non-neoplastic lymphoid infiltrates had mixed (67 of 73) or focal homogeneous (32 of 73) patterns of aggregate marking, whereas only 5 of 11 patients (45%) with extramarrow SCLN had aggregates with these patterns. The size and number of aggregates with a homogeneous marking pattern further helped discriminate between the patients with SCLN and those with apparently non-neoplastic lymphoid aggregates. These findings suggest that a homogeneous pattern of lymphoid aggregate staining with L-26 is more common in patients with SCLN than in those patients with lymphoid aggregates and no evidence of neoplasia. Paraffin immunoperoxidase staining with L-26 may be a helpful adjunct to histopathologic examination in evaluating marrow lymphoid aggregates.","['Bluth, R F', 'Casey, T T', 'McCurley, T L']","['Bluth RF', 'Casey TT', 'McCurley TL']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Sialoglycoproteins/immunology', 'Staining and Labeling']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/99.2.150 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Feb;99(2):150-6. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/99.2.150.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High affinity receptors for RANTES have been identified on a human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, which responded to RANTES in chemotaxis and calcium mobilization assays. Steady-state binding data analyses revealed approximately 700 binding sites/cell on THP-1 cells with a Kd value of 400 pM, comparable to that expressed on human peripheral blood monocytes. The RANTES binding to monocytic cells was competed for by monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) alpha, two other chemokine beta cytokines. Although MCAF and MIP-1 alpha competed for RANTES binding to monocytes with apparent lower affinity (with estimated Kd of 6 and 1.6, nM respectively) both of these cytokines effectively desensitized the calcium mobilization induced by RANTES. The chemotactic response of THP-1 cells to RANTES was also markedly inhibited by preincubation with MCAF or MIP-1 alpha. In contrast, RANTES did not desensitize the THP-1 calcium mobilization and chemotaxis in response to MCAF or MIP-1 alpha. These results, together with our previous observations that RANTES did not compete for MCAF or MIP-1 alpha binding on monocytic cells, indicate the expression of promiscuous receptors on monocytes that recognize one or more cytokines within the chemokine beta family.","['Wang, J M', 'McVicar, D W', 'Oppenheim, J J', 'Kelvin, D J']","['Wang JM', 'McVicar DW', 'Oppenheim JJ', 'Kelvin DJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokine CCL5', 'Chemotactic Factors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/physiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/physiology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins', 'Monocytes/chemistry/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Monokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.3.699 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Mar 1;177(3):699-705. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.3.699.,,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,PMC2190922,,,,,,,,,,

[Ca2+]i increased from 120 +/- 35 nM to 300 +/- 80 nM after a C3a challenge, as measured by digital imaging fluorescence microscopy, and rested at its basal level in the presence of C3a-desArg, the immediate catabolic product of C3a in vivo. This [Ca2+]i increase could be completely desensitized homologously by C3a as well as inhibited by up to 75% by pertussis toxin. Thus, tumor-derived basophils are suitable for cloning of the human C3a receptor.","['Kretzschmar, T', 'Jeromin, A', 'Gietz, C', 'Bautsch, W', 'Klos, A', 'Kohl, J', 'Rechkemmer, G', 'Bitter-Suermann, D']","['Kretzschmar T', 'Jeromin A', 'Gietz C', 'Bautsch W', 'Klos A', 'Kohl J', 'Rechkemmer G', 'Bitter-Suermann D']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical School of Hannover.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Anaphylatoxins/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Complement C3a/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Complement C5a/metabolism', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Complement/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830230239 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1993 Feb;23(2):558-61. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830230239.,,"['0 (Anaphylatoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (complement C3a, des-Arg-(77)-)', '80295-42-7 (Complement C3a)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study investigates the effect of CDDP on the susceptibility of K562 cells to lysis by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), natural killer (NK) cells, and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was determined by the 51Cr release assay. RESULTS: Treatment of K562 cells with CDDP at 10 micrograms/ml or more for 3 hours or more enhanced their susceptibility to lysis by PBL. This CDDP-mediated enhancement of lysis was observed by PBL derived from healthy donors and from patients with urinary bladder tumor or with other malignant and nonmalignant urologic diseases. The CDDP-induced enhancement of K562 cell susceptibility to lysis by PBL also was observed when purified NK cells and LAK cells were used as effector cells. The CDDP analog, carboplatin, enhanced the susceptibility of K562 cells to lysis by PBL, but treatment with transdiamminedichloroplatinum (II) had no effect. Several experiments were done to investigate the mechanism of the enhanced susceptibility of CDDP-treated K562 cells to lysis by PBL. Treatment of K562 cells with CDDP had no effect on the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I, MHC Class II, neural cellular adhesion molecule, and leukocyte function antigen-1 on the tumor cells. The frequency of target cell conjugates to PBL was not changed by CDDP-treated K562 cells. Pretreatment of K562 cells with CDDP and lysosomotrophic agents (L-leucine-methyl-ester or chloroquine) abrogated their enhanced susceptibility to lysis by PBL. CDDP treatment of K562 cells did not augment their sensitivity to alpha-interferon, gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or natural killer cytotoxic factor (NKCF). Treatment of effector cells with CDDP had no effect on their cytotoxic function. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CDDP has a direct effect on the K562 target cells, rendering them more susceptible to lysis by PBL, NK cells, and LAK cells. In addition, the result suggest that CDDP-mediated enhancement of target cell lysis is not attributable to changes of surface membrane antigen expression or recruitment of precursor cells but to processing of CDDP by the cells. The possible mechanisms of the effect of CDDP on K562 cells and clinical implications are discussed.","['Mizutani, Y', 'Bonavida, B', 'Nio, Y', 'Yoshida, O']","['Mizutani Y', 'Bonavida B', 'Nio Y', 'Yoshida O']","['Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Antigens, Surface/drug effects', 'Carboplatin/pharmacology', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930215)71:4<1313::aid-cncr2820710424>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Feb 15;71(4):1313-21. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930215)71:4<1313::aid-cncr2820710424>3.0.co;2-#.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '13022-42-9 (leucyl-leucine-methyl ester)', '14913-33-8 (transplatin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve adults with haematological malignancies received consolidation chemotherapy of complete remission. Monocytes and T cells were collected during the phase of recovery from intensive chemotherapy, and were incubated for 24 h in a culture medium with 10% FCS. Concentrations of cytokines in the culture supernatant were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. During the recovery phase, concentrations of IL-6, G-CSF and IL-1 beta in the culture supernatant of the collected monocytes significantly exceeded those of the monocytes obtained from normal healthy subjects. Similarly, the concentrations of GM-CSF and IFN-gamma in the supernatant of recovery phase T cells significantly exceeded those of normal T cells. Plasma levels of these cytokines were also elevated. These data suggest that the monocytes and T cells may be activated in vivo to produce haemopoietic cytokines during haematological recovery, and that, during haematological recovery, the monocytes and T cells may be actively involved in the induction of haematopoiesis following the myelosuppression induced by chemotherapy.","['Takamatsu, Y', 'Akashi, K', 'Harada, M', 'Teshima, T', 'Inaba, S', 'Shimoda, K', 'Eto, T', 'Shibuya, T', 'Okamura, S', 'Niho, Y']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Akashi K', 'Harada M', 'Teshima T', 'Inaba S', 'Shimoda K', 'Eto T', 'Shibuya T', 'Okamura S', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04625.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Jan;83(1):21-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04625.x.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significant difference in binding of NK-resistant T-cell lymphoma (HuT 78) and NK-sensitive myeloid (K562) blasts to fresh PBL was observed (P < 0.01). Activation of lymphocytes with IL-2 resulted in a significant increase of binding and killing of both K562 and HuT 78. However, in the case of blasts from NK-resistant cell line Daudi a similar conjugate formation with fresh PBL and LAK effectors was observed, despite a significant increase in killing. Various subpopulations of LAK effectors (CD3, CD16 and CD56 positive) displayed similar binding activity towards myeloid (K562) and lymphoid (Raji) blasts, which shows that conjugate formation occurs not only with NK-cell-derived, but also with T-cell-derived LAK cells. The blocking of CD71 antigen (transferrin receptor) on K562 blasts inhibited binding of cytotoxic lymphocytes, which was mostly due to the blocking of binding of CD56+ subpopulation.

These leukemias, which resemble acute monocytic leukemia-M5 in humans are induced only in mice undergoing a peritoneal chronic inflammatory response. We have found that two leukemia-specific gag-myb mRNAs in MML provide molecular markers for detection of preleukemic cells in hematopoietic tissue in vivo. The two aberrant RNAs result from splicing of gag to either exon 3 or 4 of c-myb, depending on the site of proviral integration. After reverse transcription-PCR with nested primers and hybridization with specific gag-myb junction probes, one cell, having aberrant c-myb message, could be detected in a minimum of 10(5) liver cells or 10(6) spleen or bone-marrow cells. This approach was used to examine hematopoietic tissues of mice after pristane injection to induce inflammation and virus inoculation. Cells with gag-myb mRNAs could be detected as early as 2 weeks after virus inoculation. In mice receiving both pristane and virus, there was evidence of preleukemic cells in 83% of the mice by 3 weeks after virus infection. Furthermore, 100% of the mice were positive for preleukemic cells by 8 weeks, even though only 50% of mice have been shown to succumb to MML (peak time for disease latency is 12-16 weeks). Cells with these aberrant c-myb messages were initially detected in the bone marrow, but during intermediate stages of disease development these cells disseminated to the spleen, liver, and granuloma. At preleukemic times, from 3 to 8 weeks after virus infection, a lower percentage of mice were positive in the group that did not receive pristane compared with mice in the group receiving pristane. However, at 18 weeks, 100% of the mice in the group receiving virus only had evidence of cells expressing gag-myb RNA in their spleens and/or bone marrow; it is of interest that mice inoculated with virus alone never develop MML. This approach for detecting preleukemic cells will now allow the study of mechanisms by which these preleukemic cells progress to a more transformed state and, perhaps, to a more differentiated state.","['Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Wolff, L']","['Nason-Burchenal K', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Female', 'Genes, gag', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Oncogenes', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.4.1619 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Feb 15;90(4):1619-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.4.1619.,,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,"['c-myb', 'gag']",,PMC45926,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that normal stem cells coexist with malignant stem cells in the bone marrow of patients with chronic-phase CML. To characterize the primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells within CML marrow, CD34+DR- and CD34+DR+ cells were isolated using centrifugal elutriation, monoclonal antibody labeling, and flow cytometric cell sorting. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of RNA samples from these CD34+ subpopulations was used to detect the presence of the BCR/ABL translocation characteristic of CML. The CD34+DR+ subpopulation contained BCR/ABL(+) cells in 11 of 12 marrow samples studied, whereas the CD34+DR- subpopulation contained BCR/ABL(+) cells in 6 of 9 CML marrow specimens. These cell populations were assayed for hematopoietic progenitor cells, and individual hematopoietic colonies were analyzed by PCR for their BCR/ABL status. Results from six patients showed that nearly half of the myeloid colonies cloned from CD34+DR- cells were BCR/ABL(+), although the CD34+DR- subpopulation contained significantly fewer BCR/ABL(+) progenitor cells than either low-density bone marrow (LDBM) or the CD34+DR+ fraction. These CD34+ cells were also used to establish stromal cell-free long-term bone marrow cultures to assess the BCR/ABL status of hematopoietic stem cells within these CML marrow populations. After 28 days in culture, three of five cultures initiated with CD34+DR- cells produced BCR/ABL(-) cells. By contrast, only one of eight cultures initiated with CD34+DR+ cells were BCR/ABL(-) after 28 days. These results indicate that the CD34+DR- subpopulation of CML marrow still contains leukemic progenitor cells, although to a lesser extent than either LDBM or CD34+DR+ cells.","['Leemhuis, T', 'Leibowitz, D', 'Cox, G', 'Silver, R', 'Srour, E F', 'Tricot, G', 'Hoffman, R']","['Leemhuis T', 'Leibowitz D', 'Cox G', 'Silver R', 'Srour EF', 'Tricot G', 'Hoffman R']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82078-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 1;81(3):801-7.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of Ca2+ in the signal transduction pathways regulating differentiation remains unclear. To begin to address this uncertainty we have characterized the regulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and the possible role of calcium channels during induced differentiation in MELC. MELC can be induced to terminal differentiation using the polar/apolar compound hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). We found that HMBA stimulated Ca2+ influx within 3 to 6 minutes and that Ca2+ entry was required but not sufficient for MELC growth and differentiation. Nifedipine (1 to 10 mumol/L), a calcium channel antagonist, blocked HMBA-induced Ca2+ influx and inhibited differentiation by approximately 60%. Depolarization of the MELC membrane did not induce Ca2+ influx and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings failed to detect a voltage-activated Ca2+ current, suggesting that MELC do not express detectable levels of a functional voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC). However, a cDNA probe encoding a portion of the alpha 1 subunit of the cardiac VDCC detected an approximately 8-kb mRNA on Northern blots of total MELC RNA. Taken together, these data show that Ca2+ influx is an early event associated with HMBA-induced differentiation in MELC, blockade of this calcium influx inhibits induced differentiation, and a voltage-insensitive dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel may be involved in Ca2+ influx in MELC.","['Gillo, B', 'Ma, Y S', 'Marks, A R']","['Gillo B', 'Ma YS', 'Marks AR']","['Department of Medicine, Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-, Methyl ester/pharmacology', 'Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nifedipine/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthenes']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82076-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 1;81(3):783-92.,"['NS29814/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10-RR02791/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '23D4W0B50Y (Fluo-3)', '71145-03-4 (3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid,', '1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-, Methyl ester)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tal-1 gene encodes a putative transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix domain and is known to be predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. We investigated the pattern of tal-1 expression in purified human hematopoietic cells by in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. Both methods demonstrated that the tal-1 gene is expressed in megakaryocytes and erythroblasts as well as in basophilic granulocytes. In addition, our results indicate that the tal-1 1A promoter, which contains two consensus GATA-binding sites, is active mainly in these lineages. Because the GATA-1 gene is known to transactivate several genes specific for the erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mastocytic/basophilic lineages, we studied GATA-1 expression in these purified hematopoietic cells. We found that GATA-1 and tal-1 genes are coexpressed in these three lineages. Remarkably, the expression of both genes is downmodulated during erythroid and megakaryocytic terminal maturation. In immature hematopoietic cells, tal-1 and GATA-1 genes are coexpressed in committed progenitors cells (CD34+/CD38(2+)), whereas they are not detectable in the most primitive cells (CD34(2+)/CD38-). In contrast, GATA-2 is strongly expressed in both most primitive and committed progenitors cells, whereas GATA-3 is mostly detected in most primitive ones. Altogether our results strongly suggest that GATA-1 modulates the transcription of tal-1 during the differentiation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic, and basosophilic lineages.","['Mouthon, M A', 'Bernard, O', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Romeo, P H', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Mathieu-Mahul, D']","['Mouthon MA', 'Bernard O', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Romeo PH', 'Vainchenker W', 'Mathieu-Mahul D']","['INSERM 91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Exons', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thymus Gland/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82059-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 1;81(3):647-55.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,"['SCL', 'TCL5', 'tal-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In screening of interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid leukemia cells for protein tyrosine kinases, we observed that all cell lines examined expressed high levels of Tec transcripts. However, characterization of Tec cDNAs indicated that they differed significantly from the published sequence. Most strikingly, an insertion of 41 bp in the 5' region affects the initiation codon and results in replacing the published 13 amino acid amino-terminal sequences with 94 amino acids. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, only the form containing the insertion was detected in hematopoietic cells. In addition, we found an in-frame insertion of 66 bp that introduces an additional 22 amino acids into the SH3 domain. This insertion restores conserved SH3 sequences that are found in the src gene family and in the Dsrc28C gene. By PCR analysis, approximately equal levels of Tec transcripts containing the intact SH3 domain and containing the 22 amino acid deletion were found in hematopoietic cells. Lastly, by interspecies backcross analysis, we show that the Tec gene is tightly linked to the c-Kit gene on mouse chromosome 5.","['Mano, H', 'Mano, K', 'Tang, B', 'Koehler, M', 'Yi, T', 'Gilbert, D J', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Ihle, J N']","['Mano H', 'Mano K', 'Tang B', 'Koehler M', 'Yi T', 'Gilbert DJ', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Ihle JN']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-onc/genetics', 'Genes, src', 'Hematopoietic System/*enzymology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Feb;8(2):417-24.,"['DK42932/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-onc)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (v-fps oncogene protein, Fujinami sarcoma virus)']",,,"['c-Kit', 'src', 'tec']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas an immunotoxin constructed from the murine anti-CD19(B43) monoclonal antibody and the plant toxin pokeweed antiviral protein (B43-PAP) has a potent in vitro anti-leukemic effect against clonogenic RS4;11 cells, its activity is further potentiated by the active cyclophosphamide congener mafosfamid. These intriguing observations prompted us to evaluate the in vivo antileukemic efficacy of combined immunochemotherapy employing B43-PAP immunotoxin plus cyclophosphamide against human t(4;11) leukemia cells in an RS4;11 severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model system. Intravenous injections of B43-PAP or cyclophosphamide improved survival of SCID mice challenged with RS4;11 leukemia, as reflected by markedly prolonged median survival times. After intravenous inoculation of 5 x 10(7) RS4;11 leukemia cells, the median survival times were 41 days for saline-treated control mice (n = 12), 44 days for control mice treated with unconjugated B43 monoclonal antibody and PAP (n = 12), 56 days for mice treated with the control immunotoxin G17.2 (anti-CD4)-PAP (n = 6), 79 days for B43-PAP-treated test mice (n = 12), and 80 days for cyclophosphamide-treated test mice (n = 16). Notably, combined immunochemotherapy using B43-PAP plus cyclophosphamide was significantly more effective than either B43-PAP or cyclophosphamide alone. The median survival time for a total of 22 SCID mice undergoing combined immunochemotherapy with B43-PAP followed by cyclophosphamide (n = 12) or cyclophosphamide followed B43-PAP (n = 10) was > 150 days. The Kaplan-Meier estimates and standard errors of the probability of event-free survival at 5 months after inoculation of 5 x 10(7) RS4;11 cells were 21 +/- 13% for B43-PAP-treated mice, 7 +/- 6% for cyclophosphamide-treated mice, 90 +/- 10% for mice treated with B43-PAP followed by cyclophosphamide (n = 12), and 90 +/- 10% for mice treated with cyclophosphamide followed by B43-PAP (n = 10).

This study shows that recombinant human stem-cell factor (rhSCF) can completely replace these lymphokines in supporting the continued propagation of M07e cells mostly by eliciting GM-CSF secretion in this target. In fact, in short-term proliferation assays the stimulatory activity of SCF is blocked about 75% by a GM-CSF-specific serum. In addition, we could detect GM-CSF expression by SCF-stimulated M07e cells, both at the protein and mRNA levels. In contrast, SCF does not induce transcripts for any other cytokine to which M07e cells are responsive, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-6. Overall, these data show that the ability of SCF to support the growth of this megakaryocytic cell line is mediated mostly by the induction of an autocrine loop of activation involving GM-CSF production. The finding that SCF can stimulate GM-CSF secretion also in an IL-2-dependent T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line indicates that SCF can act on cells of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and that the ability to induce cytokines in target cells represents an important aspect of its mechanism of action.","['Kiss, C', 'Cesano, A', 'Zsebo, K M', 'Clark, S C', 'Santoli, D']","['Kiss C', 'Cesano A', 'Zsebo KM', 'Clark SC', 'Santoli D']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):235-40.,"['5 FO5 TW04350/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case of CD7+ TdT+ leukemia thus represents either an early T-cell or true stem cell BC of CML, and demonstrates the need for gene rearrangement studies in T-cell phenotype BC.","['Smith, M R', 'Mohamed, A N', 'Karanes, C']","['Smith MR', 'Mohamed AN', 'Karanes C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201-1998.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/pathology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):177-80.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fresh and frozen leukemic cells were studied from 70 patients of whom 53 had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). HN was strongly expressed (> 80% blood cells) in two out of 13 M4 AMLs and four out of four M5B AMLs. One further M4 AML displayed 25% positive cells and two 20% cell positivity cases were seen, in one case of M4 AML and in one case of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The rest of the cases of AML as well as all cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed almost no positivity (< 1%). The residual positive cells appeared to be normal blood promonocytes.

A significant correlation was found (p < 0.0001) between the number of HN-positive leukemic cells and the number of cells with a monocytic morphology, suggesting that HN is a marker for the promonocyte.","['Delpech, B', 'Vannier, J P', 'Girard, N', 'Bizet, M', 'Delpech, A', 'Lenormand, B', 'Tilly, H', 'Piguet, H']","['Delpech B', 'Vannier JP', 'Girard N', 'Bizet M', 'Delpech A', 'Lenormand B', 'Tilly H', 'Piguet H']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre Henri-Becquerel, Rouen, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):172-6.,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein, which transports certain antitumor agents out of resistant tumor cells, is known to be a major factor in some types of multidrug resistance. Studies have shown that verapamil and the immunosuppressors cyclosporine and FK-506 can reverse multidrug resistance in vitro and in vivo and that the P-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody MRK-16 increases drug toxicity in multidrug-resistant tumors. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to establish effective treatment modalities for overcoming multidrug resistance. We assessed the synergistic effects of verapamil, cyclosporine, or FK-506 in combination with MRK-16 and antitumor agents. METHODS: Human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and multidrug-resistant K562/ADM cells were treated with vincristine or doxorubicin combined with MRK-16 and cyclosporine alone or together; MRK-16 and verapamil alone or together; or MRK-16 and FK-506. The effects of MRK-16 and cyclosporine or verapamil on the accumulation of vincristine and doxorubicin were examined in K562/ADM cells, and the mechanisms of action were analyzed. RESULTS: MRK-16 and cyclosporine synergistically enhanced the antitumor effects of vincristine and of doxorubicin in K562/ADM cells. However, the combined use of MRK-16 with verapamil or FK-506 did not show such synergistic effects in these cells. Studies of the effect of MRK-16 on cellular accumulation of cyclosporine and verapamil revealed that MRK-16 substantially increased accumulation of cyclosporine in K562/ADM cells, but did not increase accumulation of verapamil. CONCLUSIONS: MRK-16 and cyclosporine synergistically enhanced the antitumor effects of vincristine and doxorubicin because MRK-16 increased cellular accumulation of cyclosporine. IMPLICATIONS: These results, together with our previous finding that intravenous administration of MRK-16 induced regression of multidrug-resistant subcutaneous tumors in athymic mice, support the hypothesis that the combined use of MRK-16 and cyclosporine might increase the efficacy of antitumor agents against multidrug-resistant tumors expressing P-glycoprotein. Clinical phase I trials of MRK-16 in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors are under consideration.","['Naito, M', 'Tsuge, H', 'Kuroko, C', 'Koyama, T', 'Tomida, A', 'Tatsuta, T', 'Heike, Y', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Naito M', 'Tsuge H', 'Kuroko C', 'Koyama T', 'Tomida A', 'Tatsuta T', 'Heike Y', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*physiology', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/metabolism/pharmacology']",1993/02/17 00:00,1993/02/17 00:01,['1993/02/17 00:00'],"['1993/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.4.311 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Feb 17;85(4):311-6. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.4.311.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, immunobeads were used to separate blasts from three Kit-expression positive cell lines into strongly Kit-protein positive and weakly Kit-protein positive fractions. The strongly positive fraction had greater proliferative potential than the weakly positive fraction as assessed both by colony-formation in methylcellulose and growth of clonogenic cells in suspension. The reproducibility of the percentage of each blast population found in the strongly and weakly positive fractions provided evidence that Kit-protein expression is regulated. Kinetic experiments provided evidence for reversible transitions between strong and weak Kit protein expression. Thus regulated expression of the Kit receptor may be a mechanism for controlling blast cell growth in culture.","['Tohda, S', 'Yang, G S', 'Ashman, L K', 'McCulloch, E A', 'Minden, M D']","['Tohda S', 'Yang GS', 'Ashman LK', 'McCulloch EA', 'Minden MD']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041540225 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Feb;154(2):410-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041540225.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are involved in the control of normal development as well as in the regulation of gene expression in adult differentiating systems, including hematopoiesis. Aberrant expression of homeobox-containing genes has recently been related to leukemic phenotype. Human homeobox-containing genes of the HOX family are organized into 4 large clusters. We have analyzed the expression of HOX genes in different types of human leukemia to investigate whether the physical organization of HOX loci reflects a regulatory hierarchy involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells or whether HOX gene expression might contribute to the leukemic phenotype. Our results show that HOX genes are coordinately regulated in blocks in myeloid cells whereas they appear to function as isolated genes in lymphoid cells. Six contiguous genes of the HOX2 locus, highly expressed in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, are switched off in chronic myelogenous leukemia, suggesting that down-regulation of HOX2 genes might be required for cell maturation of the myeloid lineages. In contrast, a few scattered genes are active in lymphoid populations. These observations suggest that hematopoietic cells express a repertoire of HOX genes characteristic of a particular cell lineage at a specific stage of differentiation. The characteristic patterns of HOX gene expression may reflect the potentially important role that these genes play in cell lineage determination during both normal and leukemic hematopoiesis.","['Celetti, A', 'Barba, P', 'Cillo, C', 'Rotoli, B', 'Boncinelli, E', 'Magli, M C']","['Celetti A', 'Barba P', 'Cillo C', 'Rotoli B', 'Boncinelli E', 'Magli MC']","['International Institute of Genetics and Biophysics, CNR, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Phenotype', 'Poly A/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1993/01/21 00:00,1993/01/21 00:01,['1993/01/21 00:00'],"['1993/01/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/21 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910530211 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Jan 21;53(2):237-44. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910530211.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,['HOX'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of normal and SPLXM with rhG-CSF induced marked granulocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow with expansion of the granulocytic marrow into the adjoining muscle as in acute myelocytic leukemia. The hyperplasia is greater in the SPLXM than in the normal mouse where splenic hyperplasia occurs in all cell lines. The rhG-CSF also results in expansion of granulopoiesis into the normally fatty tail bone marrow in SPLXM. The rhG-CSF treatment produced marked increases in the assayable numbers of GM-CFU, G-CFU and M-CFU. The significance and mechanisms of induction of these changes are not clear.

Malleobactin was capable of removing iron from both transferrin and lactoferrin at pH values of 7.4, 6.0, and 5.0. However, the levels of iron mobilization were greater for transferrin than for lactoferrin at all the pH values used in the assay. The ability of Pseudomonas pseudomallei to acquire iron from 30% iron-saturated transferrin and K562 human erythroleukemic cells was compared in parallel cultures as described previously (J. H. Brock, P. H. Williams, J. Liceaga, and K. G. Woldridge, Infect. Immun. 59:3185-3190, 1991). P. pseudomallei U7 tended to acquire iron from transferrin. In contrast, P. aeruginosa PAO and P. cepacia Pc275C acquired iron from both sources. P. cepacia H1721, which does not produce detectable siderophores, but can utilize malleobactin, pyochelin, and azurechelin as iron sources, was used in a similar experiment. Addition of malleobactin resulted in iron uptake only from transferrin, whereas pyochelin and azurechelin promoted iron uptake from both sources. When the siderophores were incubated with K562 cells alone, malleobactin was less efficient at removing iron from cells than pyochelin and azurechelin. It was also determined that malleobactin was less effective in binding to or entering cells than pyochelin and azurechelin. These results suggest that malleobactin can acquire iron more effectively from host proteins than from cellular sources. Pyochelin and azurechelin can acquire cell-derived iron in addition to iron bound to host proteins.","['Yang, H', 'Kooi, C D', 'Sokol, P A']","['Yang H', 'Kooi CD', 'Sokol PA']","['Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University of Calgary Health Sciences Centre, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,IM,"['Burkholderia pseudomallei/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Lactoferrin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Siderophores/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.61.2.656-662.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1993 Feb;61(2):656-62. doi: 10.1128/iai.61.2.656-662.1993.,,"['0 (Siderophores)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",,,,,PMC302777,,,,,,,,,,

Neither cytokine stimulated clonal proliferation of marrow-derived progenitors; however, both IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha enhanced macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-dependent colony formation. The additional progenitors stimulated by IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha to form colonies in response to M-CSF were equivalent to the precommitment, transitional progenitors stimulated by M-CSF and bacterial LPS. In addition, the additional colonies elicited by IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha were not additive in cultures containing both M-CSF and LPS, indicating these colonies arose from the same LPS-responsive, two-signal-dependent transitional progenitors. Leukemia inhibitory factor did not influence M-CSF-stimulated colony formation; however, LIF effected a dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation by transitional progenitors responding to combinations of M-CSF and LPS, IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, or an additional transitional cell costimulant, substance P. Neutralizing anti-murine TNF-alpha antibodies abrogated transitional cell colony formation stimulated by combinations of M-CSF and TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, LPS, or substance P but had no effect on colony formation stimulated solely by M-CSF.

In addition, the results indicate that LIF may play an opposing negative regulatory role acting to inhibit LPS and TNF-alpha stimulation of the transitional progenitors.","['Kreisberg, R', 'Detrick, M S', 'Moore, R N']","['Kreisberg R', 'Detrick MS', 'Moore RN']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville 37996-0845.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Substance P/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*pharmacology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.61.2.418-422.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1993 Feb;61(2):418-22. doi: 10.1128/iai.61.2.418-422.1993.,['DK43229/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,PMC302745,,,,,,,,,,

A receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) has previously been shown to play a fundamental role in locomotion of ras-transformed cells as well as functioning in signal transduction. Expression of RHAMM was characterized on B lymphocytes from normal and malignant lymphoid tissues using multiparameter phenotypic immunofluorescence analysis as well as functional analysis of its role in locomotion of malignant hairy cell leukemia B cells. RHAMM is not detectable on most normal B cells located in blood, spleen, or lymph node, but it is detectable on bone marrow and thymic B cells. Among B-cell malignancies, it is expressed on most terminally differentiated B cells from multiple myeloma bone marrows, is present on a subset of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and is absent on B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Activation of peripheral blood B cells by Staphylococcus A cowan (SAC), but not by pokeweed mitogen, induced transient expression of RHAMM at day 3 of culture, suggesting RHAMM may be used by antigen-activated normal B cells. For malignant cells, expression of RHAMM increased on long-term culture of bone marrow plasma cells from multiple myeloma patients, indicating prolonged expression in contrast to the transient expression on SAC-activated normal B cells. Intriguingly, RHAMM was expressed on hairy leukemia cells located in spleen but absent from those in peripheral blood of the same patient. RHAMM, as expressed on splenic hairy cells, was a 58-Kd molecule that binds hyaluronan, is encoded by a 5.2-kb messenger RNA, and participates in locomotion by these cells. Hairy cells locomoted in response to hyaluronan at 4 mu per minute. Monoclonal antibody to RHAMM inhibited this locomotion almost completely as detected using video time-lapse cinemicrography. These observations are consistent with a role for RHAMM in malignant invasion and metastatic growth.","['Turley, E A', 'Belch, A J', 'Poppema, S', 'Pilarski, L M']","['Turley EA', 'Belch AJ', 'Poppema S', 'Pilarski LM']","['Manitoba Institute for Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/physiology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/*metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74297-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 15;81(2):446-53.,['CA51540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Env gene sequence analysis of E-55+ and E-55- clones showed that the E-55- virus was generated from the E-55+ virus as the result of a recombination between E-55+ virus and the endogenous ecotropic virus, emv-1, carried in the genome of the BALB.K mouse strain. The recombinant E-55- virus is replication competent. This recombination event and the consequential expression of E-55- virus consistently occur in immunocompetent BALB.K mice inoculated with the E-55+ virus and appear to play a role in the loss of epitopes recognized by virus neutralizing antibodies.

P-glycoprotein is thought to function as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. The monoclonal antibody MRK-16 binds to an external domain of P-glycoprotein and partially inhibits drug efflux in multidrug-resistant cells. As an approach toward elucidating the mechanism by which MRK-16 affects drug transport, we undertook the definition of the precise binding site of this antibody. In this study we have mapped the epitope of MRK-16 monoclonal antibody to a resolution of a single amino acid using a series of overlapping synthetic peptides. We demonstrate that MRK-16 recognizes only the class I isoform (MDR1) of human P-glycoprotein and that its epitope encompasses at least two (first and fourth) of the six predicted extracellular peptide loops. These results suggest that the epitope of MRK-16 is discontinuous and that the sequences involved which are separated by about 625 amino acids in the linear sequence must be spatially situated in close proximity in the native protein. Based on these results, we present a model for transmembrane alpha-helical packing of P-glycoprotein in the lipid bilayer. This may have implications for understanding the function of P-glycoprotein in drug transport.","['Georges, E', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Ling, V']","['Georges E', 'Tsuruo T', 'Ling V']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipid Bilayers/chemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/25 00:00,1993/01/25 00:01,['1993/01/25 00:00'],"['1993/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53923-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jan 25;268(3):1792-8.,['CA37130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine-phosphorylated 53- and 55-kDa proteins in TPA-treated HL-60 cells were absorbed with antitubulin antibody indicating that the predominantly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins during the monocytic differentiation were tubulins. By combination of immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay, the protein tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Lyn, which were abundantly induced during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, were demonstrated to be associated with tubulin in the cells. The reorganization of microtubules was observed by immunostaining using rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse Ig and mouse anti-alpha-tubulin mAb.

To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying this synergism, induction of immediate-early genes was studied. Treatment of MO7e cells with SLF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 induced/enhanced expression of c-fos, junB, egr-1, and c-myc genes. SLF treatment of MO7e cells led to higher expression of c-fos, junB, and egr-1 genes than did treatment with GM-CSF or IL-3. However, GM-CSF and IL-3 had more prolonged effects on enhancement of the c-myc gene than SLF. Using optimal dosages for cell proliferation, induction of c-fos and junB was greater than additive with SLF plus GM-CSF or IL-3, as compared with each factor alone. Using suboptimal amounts of SLF with optimal GM-CSF or IL-3, induction of c-fos, junB, egr-1, and c-myc genes was greater than additive.

We investigated the expression of very late activation (VLA) integrins in five human leukemic cell lines of pre-B cell phenotype. VLA-4 was found to be the dominant integrin in all five, three possessed VLA-5, and one VLA-6. None had VLA-2, or VLA-3. Since certain anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been reported to induce homotypic aggregation of T and B lymphocytes we investigated the possibility that VLA-4 might be involved in aggregation of pre-B cells. mAb 44H6 (anti-VLA-alpha 4), and 4B4 (anti-VLA-beta 1) induced strong aggregation which was not blocked by the anti-FC gamma IIR mAb IV.3. However, aggregation was effected in only three of the five lines suggesting the involvement of molecules other than VLA-4. The level of expression of CD9, but not that of CD11a, CD18, CD19, CD44, or CD54, was found to correlate with the level of aggregation. Of mAb directed to CD9, CD19, CD44, endoglin, and HLA-DR only mAb to CD9 induced aggregation. Admixture of mAb ALB6 (anti-CD9) and mAb 44H6 neither potentiated nor inhibited the response indicating a common effector mechanism.

This is in contrast to the prolonged life span of the leukemic cells in vivo and likely reflects the lack of essential growth factors in the tissue culture medium. We found that interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibits programmed cell death and promotes survival of B-CLL cells in culture. This effect may also be important in vivo: increased serum levels of IFN-gamma, ranging from 60 to > 2,200 pg/ml, were found in 7 of 10 B-CLL samples tested, whereas the sera of 10 healthy individuals did not contain detectable levels of this cytokine (< 20 pg/ml). High levels of IFN-gamma message were detected in RNA from T cell-depleted B-CLL peripheral blood samples by Northern blot analysis. Synthesis of IFN-gamma by B-CLL lymphocytes was confirmed by in situ hybridization and flow cytometry. The majority of B-CLL cells (74-82%) expressed detectable levels of IFN-gamma mRNA, and CD19+ B-CLL cells were labeled with anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibodies. These results show that IFN-gamma inhibits programmed cell death in B-CLL cells and suggest that the malignant cells are able to synthesize this cytokine.

Here, we provide evidence that preferential usage of LFA-1 over VLA-4 is yet another mechanism to control T cell adhesion. We observed that binding of activated T lymphocytes, as opposed to resting T cells, to EC is essentially mediated through LFA-1 and not through VLA-4. VLA-4-mediated adhesion of T cells to EC is only found when LFA-1 is not expressed or not functional, as observed for several T cell leukemia cell lines.

Among other cells, defective production of or defective response to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) might be involved in the pathophysiology of these disorders of hematopoiesis. Reverse transcription of messenger RNA and subsequent specific amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) served as a sensitive technique to detect G-CSF and GM-CSF gene expression. We have tested two alternative assays for the specific quantitation of transcript levels for G-CSF. Applying one assay we could demonstrate that: 1) peripheral blood monocytes from 5 patients with SCN are able to express G-CSF and GM-CSF messenger RNA, suggesting that defective production of these factors is not responsible for the neutropenia in this condition; 2) messenger RNA levels from 5 SCN patients were on average higher than the levels determined for three healthy volunteers; 3) 7 of 9 of the examined myeloid cell lines express GM-CSF and all of them G-CSF mRNA.

Patients transplanted with blood stem cells had a faster leukocyte and neutrophil recovery compared with the ABMT patients (p < 0.025 and p < 0.05, respectively).

An additional increase of G-CSF serum levels on days of fever (> or = 38.5 degrees C) or documented infectious disease was observed. During the early phase of marrow aplasia, the endogenously produced amounts of G-CSF reached concentrations which are used for in vitro stimulation of colony-forming unit granulocyte (CFU-G).

One patient was not engrafted, probably because of a low dose of reinfused cells. In 25 patients whose PBSCs were harvested after intensive chemotherapy without recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF), we found a significant correlation between the colony-forming unit for granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) infused per kilogram of the patient's body weight and the time to achieve an absolute granulocyte count (AGC) of > 0.5 x 10(9)/L (r = -0.817, p < 0.001) or a platelet count of > 50 x 10(9)/L (r = -0.703, p < 0.001). No association was seen between the number of burst-forming units for erythroid (BFU-E) infused and the speed of hematopoietic recovery. In the other 8 patients with low progenitor yields (< 1 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg), in vivo induction of PBSC was attempted by administering rG-CSF (250 to 1000 micrograms/m2/day). Seven-day administration of rG-CSF before each leukapheresis increased the committed (CFU-GM: 37.7-fold; BFU-E: 45.6-fold) as well as multipotent (CFU-mix: 6.8-fold) progenitors. These collected cells were cryopreserved and then reinfused. Using a model for simulating hematopoietic recovery kinetics, we suggest that cells induced by rG-CSF could speed the recovery of granulocyte or platelet counts after PBSC autografting.","['Kawano, Y', 'Takaue, Y', 'Watanabe, T', 'Saito, S', 'Abe, T', 'Hirao, A', 'Sato, J', 'Ninomiya, T', 'Suzue, T', 'Koyama, T']","['Kawano Y', 'Takaue Y', 'Watanabe T', 'Saito S', 'Abe T', 'Hirao A', 'Sato J', 'Ninomiya T', 'Suzue T', 'Koyama T', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Retinoblastoma/drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Jan;21(1):103-8.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three subpopulations of lin- blasts obtained were enriched for F8 (the more primitive small blasts), F11 (blasts intermediate in size), and F13 (the more mature large blasts). We examined the morphological and phenotypic characteristics and cell cycle status of the subpopulations and determined the responsiveness of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (colony-forming units/granulocyte-macrophage) derived from each subpopulation to mast cell growth factor in combination with granulocyte (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CSF) colony-stimulating factors alone and in combination. Morphological assessment revealed that an increased proportion of CML lin- blasts exhibited early cytoplasmic maturation as evidenced by the appearance of azurophilic (nonspecific) granules in the cytoplasm. Although the percentages of CML and normal small blasts expressing CD34 were similar, the proportion of CML lin- blasts expressing CD34 declined in the intermediate and more mature large lin- blast subpopulations by about 50%, whereas the percentage of CD34+ normal blasts remained essentially the same, indicating an earlier loss of CD34 expression by CML lin- blasts. In addition, the percentages of CML small blasts expressing CD33 were higher than normal (26-61% versus 0-16%, respectively), indicating that a higher proportion of CML small lin- blasts had a more mature phenotype. Mast cell growth factor addition to cultures stimulated by G-CSF, GM-CSF, or G-CSF plus GM-CSF, exerted the greatest synergistic effect (increased colony number and size) in the normal small and intermediate lin- blast cultures, but mast cell growth factor had considerably less effect, or no effect, in cultures of comparable CML subpopulations, indicating that CML lin- progenitors had a somewhat lower requirement for multiple growth factors. The findings suggest that the differences observed between normal and CML marrow subpopulations are proportional differences and that a greater proportion of CML lin- blast subpopulations exhibit characteristics associated with a more advanced stage of maturation than comparable normal lin- blast subpopulations.","['Strife, A', 'Perez, A', 'Lambek, C', 'Wisniewski, D', 'Bruno, S', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Clarkson, B']","['Strife A', 'Perez A', 'Lambek C', 'Wisniewski D', 'Bruno S', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Clarkson B']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Cell Kinetics, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jan 15;53(2):401-9.,"['CA20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we reported that another carbohydrate antigen, sialyl Lea, can also serve as a ligand for ELAM-1 (A. Takada, K. Ohmori, N. Takahashi, K. Tsuyuoka, K. Yago, K. Zenita, A. Hasegawa, and R. Kannagi, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 179: 713-719, 1991). Both sialyl Lex and sialyl Lea are expressed in many human malignant cells. In order to assess the contribution of these carbohydrate antigens to the adhesion of human malignant cells to vascular endothelium, we selected a panel of 12 cultured human epithelial cancer cell lines and a panel of 12 human leukemia cell lines which express sialyl Lex and/or sialyl Lea antigens. All 12 epithelial cancer cell lines exhibited a clearly ELAM-1-dependent adhesion to cytokine-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells, while only 3 of the 12 leukemia cell lines exhibited significant participation of ELAM-1 in the adhesion. With regard to epithelial cancer cells, the adhesion of 6 cancer cell lines, mostly of colon and pancreas origin, was dependent almost exclusively on sialyl Lea. A significant contribution of the sialyl Lex antigen was noted in the adhesion of the other 6 cell lines, including cancers of lung and liver origin. These results imply that the sialyl Lea/ELAM-1 adhesion system, as well as the sialyl Lex/ELAM-1 adhesion system, plays an important role in the adhesion of human cancer cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. With regard to leukemia cells, on the other hand, adhesion of the 3 leukemia cell lines that showed ELAM-1-dependent adhesion was mediated by the sialyl Lex antigen, and none of these leukemia cell lines expressed sialyl Lea or exhibited sialyl Lea-dependent adhesion.","['Takada, A', 'Ohmori, K', 'Yoneda, T', 'Tsuyuoka, K', 'Hasegawa, A', 'Kiso, M', 'Kannagi, R']","['Takada A', 'Ohmori K', 'Yoneda T', 'Tsuyuoka K', 'Hasegawa A', 'Kiso M', 'Kannagi R']","['Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/*metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'E-Selectin', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Lewis Blood Group Antigens/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jan 15;53(2):354-61.,,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lewis Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we have characterized very late antigen (VLA) integrin expression on normal CD34+ marrow progenitors, on leukemic cell lines, and on blasts from patients with acute myelogenous or monocytic leukemias. CD34+ progenitor cells expressed the integrin beta 1 chain (CD29), VLA-4 alpha (CD49d), and VLA-5 alpha (CD49e). The myeloid lines KG1 and KG1a also expressed CD49d and CD49e as did the Mo7e megakaryoblastic line. CD29, CD18, and CD11a were also present on each of these cell lines. Only the Mo7e line expressed the cytoadhesins GPIIbIIIa or GPIb. Binding of KG1a to marrow stroma was partially inhibited by antibodies to CD49d and its ligand, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). The majority of leukemic blasts studied expressed CD49d and CD49e as well. Blasts from patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia consistently bound to stroma at levels greater than 20%, and adhesion to stroma could in some cases be partly inhibited by anti-CD49d. No role for glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-linked structures was demonstrated in these binding assays because the adhesion of leukemic blasts to stroma was not diminished after treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). These studies indicate that CD34+ myeloid progenitors, myeloid leukemic cell lines, and leukemic blasts possess a similar array of VLA integrins. Their functional importance individually or in combination with other mediators of attachment in adhesion, transendothelial migration, and differentiation has yet to be fully elucidated.","['Liesveld, J L', 'Winslow, J M', 'Frediani, K E', 'Ryan, D H', 'Abboud, C N']","['Liesveld JL', 'Winslow JM', 'Frediani KE', 'Ryan DH', 'Abboud CN']","['Hematology Unit, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73302-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 1;81(1):112-21.,"['CA-32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 HL02385-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that IL-6 triggers the rapid activation of a nuclear factor, termed acute-phase response factor (APRF), both in rat liver in vivo and in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells in vitro. APRF bound to IL-6 response elements in the 5'-flanking regions of various acute-phase protein genes (e.g., the alpha 2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein genes). These elements contain a characteristic hexanucleotide motif, CTGGGA, known to be required for the IL-6 responsiveness of these genes. Analysis of the binding specificity of APRF revealed that it is different from NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B, transcription factors known to be regulated by cytokines and involved in the transcriptional regulation of acute-phase protein genes. In HepG2 cells, activation of APRF was observed within minutes after stimulation with IL-6 or leukemia-inhibitory factor and did not require ongoing protein synthesis. Therefore, a preexisting inactive form of APRF is activated by a posttranslational mechanism. We present evidence that this activation occurs in the cytoplasm and that a phosphorylation is involved. These results lead to the conclusions that APRF is an immediate target of the IL-6 signalling cascade and is likely to play a central role in the transcriptional regulation of many IL-6-induced genes.","['Wegenka, U M', 'Buschmann, J', 'Lutticken, C', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Horn, F']","['Wegenka UM', 'Buschmann J', 'Lutticken C', 'Heinrich PC', 'Horn F']","['Institute for Biochemistry, RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*genetics', '*Acute-Phase Reaction', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/genetics']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.1.276-288.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Jan;13(1):276-88. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.1.276-288.1993.,,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)']",,,['H-2Kb'],,PMC358907,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: This study was designed to estimate the risk of developing leukemia for patients receiving conventional doses of etoposide along with cisplatin and bleomycin. METHODS: We reviewed the records at Indiana University of all untreated patients entering clinical trials using etoposide at conventional doses (cumulative dose, 2000 mg/m2 or less) for germ cell cancer between 1982 and 1991. The records of all patients who received a chemotherapy regimen containing etoposide, ifosfamide, or cisplatin after failing to respond to primary chemotherapy were also reviewed. RESULTS: Between 1982 and 1991, 538 patients entered serial clinical trials with planned cumulative etoposide doses of 1500-2000 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin plus either ifosfamide or bleomycin. Of these 538 patients, 348 received an etoposide combination as initial chemotherapy and 190 received etoposide as part of salvage treatment. To date, 315 patients are alive, with median follow-up of 4.9 years, and 337 patients have had follow-up beyond 2 years. Two patients (0.37%) developed leukemia. One developed acute undifferentiated leukemia with a t(4;11) (q21;q23) cytogenetic abnormality 2.0 years after starting etoposide-based therapy, and one developed acute myelomonoblastic leukemia with no chromosome abnormalities 2.3 years after beginning chemotherapy. During this period, several hundred patients were treated with etoposide-based chemotherapy and did not enter clinical trials. Three of these patients are known to have developed hematologic abnormalities, including one patient with acute monoblastic leukemia with a t(11;19)(q13;p13) abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary leukemia after treatment with a conventional dose of etoposide does occur, but the low incidence does not alter the risk-to-benefit ratio of etoposide-based chemotherapy in germ cell cancer. IMPLICATIONS: The reports of leukemia associated with high doses of etoposide emphasize the need for diligent follow-up of patients and make careful risk-to-benefit analysis imperative.","['Nichols, C R', 'Breeden, E S', 'Loehrer, P J', 'Williams, S D', 'Einhorn, L H']","['Nichols CR', 'Breeden ES', 'Loehrer PJ', 'Williams SD', 'Einhorn LH']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/01/06 00:00,1993/01/06 00:01,['1993/01/06 00:00'],"['1993/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.1.36 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Jan 6;85(1):36-40. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.1.36.,['2R35CA-39844-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'BEP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonality of amplified polymerase chain reaction products was confirmed by sequence analysis for several cases. The present study shows that it is possible to amplify clonal lambda gene rearrangements in the majority of lambda-expressing B cell leukemias and lymphomas. The method described here, therefore, is a useful supplement to the previously described approach of VH and VK gene amplification to detect clonal B cell populations and allows the study of V lambda gene usage and somatic mutation in lambda-expressing normal and malignant B cells.","['Kuppers, R', 'Willenbrock, K', 'Rajewsky, K', 'Hansmann, M L']","['Kuppers R', 'Willenbrock K', 'Rajewsky K', 'Hansmann ML']","['Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Frozen Sections', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Paraffin Embedding', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1995 Sep;147(3):806-14.,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",,"['GENBANK/X84941', 'GENBANK/X84942', 'GENBANK/X84943', 'GENBANK/X84944', 'GENBANK/X84945', 'GENBANK/X84946', 'GENBANK/X84947', 'GENBANK/X84948', 'GENBANK/X84949', 'GENBANK/Z22201']",,,PMC1870987,,,,,,,,,,

The optimal time and temperature for the antigen-antibody incubation steps have been estimated for each system (3 h at 37 degrees C was chosen as a standard incubation time). A linear dependence of the chemiluminescence intensity and optical density on the concentration of antibodies to the BLV antigens was observed.

One to two weeks after inoculation, high levels of proviral DNA are usually found. This is followed by an asymptomatic period of many weeks during which proviral DNA becomes essentially undetectable. Leukemia develops approximately 28 weeks postinoculation. In this experiment, one group of mice was exposed a consistent 10L: 14D cycle while a second was maintained in constant light (LL). A third group was exposed to a rotating cycle characterized by phase shifting a 10L: 14D cycle every three 24-h days (rLD). All cycles began 2 weeks prior to inoculation and were maintained thereafter. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 5, 10, and 15 weeks, and hematopoietic tissue was examined for proviral DNA content. At 1 week, LL- and rLD-exposed animals showed considerably less proviral DNA in bone marrow and spleen compared with controls. At 15 weeks, thymuses from controls were showing signs of infection whereas tissue from LL and rLD mice remained at background levels.

In the leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, these abnormalities are frequently translocations or less often inversions which are closely associated with particular morphologic subtypes of these tumors. Rearrangements involving chromosome band 11q23 are common in acute leukemia, both lymphoblastic and myeloid (monoblastic), and are less common in lymphoma. Although several different genes have been cloned from 11q23 translocation breakpoints, the great majority involve the MLL (myeloid-lymphoid leukemia) gene. The MLL gene has several different names, ALL1, Htrx, HRX; the central part of the gene codes for multiple zinc fingers which show homology to the Drosophila trithorax gene. About 70% of infants with acute leukemia will have MLL rearrangements. MLL is involved in five common translocations as well as in 25 uncommon or rare translocations, insertions and deletions. The translocation breakpoints occur within an 8.3 kb region which can be detected with a 0.74 kb cDNA probe. Twenty-five percent of patients have a deletion 3' of the breakpoint which includes the zinc finger region. Patients who previously received drugs that inhibit topoisomerase II often develop acute leukemia with translocations involving 11q23. These translocations break MLL in the same 8.3 kb region. In the breakpoints cloned to date, the translocation leads to a fusion gene on the derivative 11 chromosome with a chimeric transcript, consisting of 5' MLL and the 3' segment of the other gene.

The identification of three RA receptors (RAR alpha, beta and gamma) as members of the nuclear receptor superfamily led to important insights into the molecular mechanism of action of retinoids. The nuclear receptors, that also include receptors for steroid hormone, vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone act as ligand-inducible transcription factors and are characterized by the presence of two well conserved DNA- and hormone-binding domains. One of the most intriguing properties of RA is its ability to induce in vivo differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells into mature granulocytes, leading to morphological complete remissions. We and others have shown that the t(15;17) translocation specifically associated with APL fuses an as yet unidentified gene, named PML, to the retinoic acid receptor alpha locus. The resulting PML-RAR alpha hybrid protein that retains most of the functional domains of parental proteins exhibits altered transactivating functions when compared to the wild-type receptor; however the biological significance of this property in the transforming phenotype is still obscure. PML, whose function is unknown, belongs to a novel family of nuclear proteins characterized by the presence of a Cys/His-rich motif, named a RING finger, that include RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors and oncoproteins. A dimerization domain within PML is able to mediate the formation of PML-RAR alpha homodimers that can bind to target sequences with distinct DNA binding properties if compared with RAR alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lavau, C', 'Jansen, J', 'Dejean, A']","['Lavau C', 'Jansen J', 'Dejean A']","['Dept des Retrovirus, INSERM U. 163, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Duplicate Publication', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/therapy', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 1995 Mar;43(3):188-96.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we demonstrate that Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappa B/Rel can be inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of proteolytic reactions in this Tax-specific activation pathway. Transient transfection and reporter gene assays have revealed that Tax overrides the inhibitory function of I kappa B alpha in both F9 embryonal cells and Jurkat T cells. Moreover, Tax-mediated inactivation of I kappa B alpha requires a 16 amino acid sequence element located at the N-terminal region (amino acid 21-36) of I kappa B alpha, which is also required for tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced degradation of this inhibitory protein. We further demonstrate that the proteasome inhibitor also blocks the degradation of I kappa B alpha observed in HTLV-I-infected T cells. Interestingly, inhibition of I kappa B alpha degradation in these cells led to the accumulation of a phosphorylated form of I kappa B alpha. Together, these studies suggest that Tax activation of NF-kappa B/Rel may involve induction of phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of the inhibitor I kappa B alpha.","['Maggirwar, S B', 'Harhaj, E', 'Sun, S C']","['Maggirwar SB', 'Harhaj E', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*physiology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Transcription Factor RelA']",1995/09/07 00:00,1995/09/07 00:01,['1995/09/07 00:00'],"['1995/09/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/07 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Sep 7;11(5):993-8.,,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No constitutive Shc phosphorylation was found in primary cell cultures and normal tissues. In 14 of 27 tumor cell lines with no reported TK alterations, Shc proteins were constitutively phosphorylated and formed stable complexes with novel tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides. Ten distinct Shc-associated phosphoproteins were identified with molecular weights ranging from 30 to 200 kDa. In a subset of carcinoma cell lines, phosphorylated Shc proteins complexed with a p175 phosphoprotein that was identified as the constitutively activated EGFR. In one glioblastoma cell line, a Shc-associated p190 was identified as the activated PDGFR. In 13 of 14 acute leukemia samples phosphorylated Shc proteins were constitutively complexed with a p140 phosphoprotein. Some of the Shc-associated phosphoproteins (EGFR, PDGFR, erbB-2, Met, bcr-abl, H4-ret) bound both the Shc- and Grb2-SH2 domains in vitro; others (p175; p70-p80) only the Shc-SH2 domain and yet others (p140) only the Grb2-SH3 domains.

In order to evaluate transforming activity of this protein, AML1/Evi-1 was introduced into Rat1 fibroblasts. Cells expressing the fusion product formed macroscopic colonies in soft agar, indicating that AML1/Evi-1 is a transforming gene. It was also demonstrated that introduction of AML1/Evi-1 into the Rat1 clones harboring BCR/ABL also conferred enhanced capacity for anchorage independent growth. Analyses of deletion mutants of AML1/Evi-1 revealed that removal of the second zinc finger domain within the Evi-1 sequence totally abrogated the ability of AML1/Evi-1 to transform Rat1 cells. We showed that the transforming effect is correlated with the AP-1 activation induced by AML1/Evi-1.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha is one of the extracellular signals implicated in the control of several aspects of retinal development, including proliferation and cell fate. The way cells interpret pleiotropic signals such as TGF-alpha is influenced by the level of expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) in some cell lines. To address the influence of receptor level on responses of retinal progenitor cells to TGF-alpha, additional copies of EGF-Rs were introduced in vitro and in vivo with a retrovirus. Normally in vitro, low concentrations of TGF-alpha stimulated proliferation whereas high concentrations biased choice of cell fate, inhibiting differentiation into rod photoreceptors while promoting differentiation into Muller glial cells. We report here that introduction of extra EGF-Rs into progenitor cells in vitro reduced the concentration of TGF-alpha required for changes in rod and Muller cell differentiation but did not enhance proliferation. Introduction of extra EGF-Rs in vivo increased the proportion of clones that contained Muller glial cells, suggesting that receptor level is normally limiting. These findings demonstrate that responsiveness to extracellular signals during development can be modulated by the introduction of additional receptors, and suggest that the level of expression of receptors for these signals contributes to the regulation of cell fate.","['Lillien, L']",['Lillien L'],"['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19072, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Culture Techniques', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neuroglia/cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retina/*cytology/growth & development', 'Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells/cytology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/*physiology']",1995/09/14 00:00,1995/09/14 00:01,['1995/09/14 00:00'],"['1995/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/377158a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1995 Sep 14;377(6545):158-62. doi: 10.1038/377158a0.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have determined that DMSO treated cells increase the levels of nuclear factors capable of overall interactions with the beta maj globin promoter during the initial 24 h post induction, as measured by gel mobility analysis. Two unprocessed beta maj globin mRNA precursors, which are present in MEL cell nuclei early in differentiation, were previously shown to contain the 5' promoter flanking region, and thereby provided the nucleus with a pool of regulatory sequences in multiple RNA copies. We have studied the effect of RNA copies of the promoter region on binding interactions between DNA sequences of the beta maj globin promoter and nuclear factors that interact with these sequences. The promoter region RNA transcripts competed effectively for DNA binding proteins in vitro, while the antisense RNA from the same region did not. The most pronounced competition was observed with proteins from 12 h after DMSO induction, when the concentration of the DNA binding proteins was still increasing. Since the 'upstream' transcripts predominate at 12 h after DMSO induction, these results indicate that the promoter region transcripts may influence the equilibrium of binding between the beta maj globin promoter and the nuclear factors that bind to this region during DMSO induction.","['Sun-Hoffman, L', 'Winicov, I']","['Sun-Hoffman L', 'Winicov I']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Nevada, Reno, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1995/04/26 00:00,1995/04/26 00:01,['1995/04/26 00:00'],"['1995/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00935488 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1995 Apr 26;145(2):159-68. doi: 10.1007/BF00935488.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By January 1994, 315 children had suffered at least one relapse. The bone marrow was involved in 216 cases. There were 69 isolated CNS relapses, 25 isolated testicular recurrences and five relapses in other extramedullary sites. Of the 315 children with relapse, 94 are still in a second complete remission 12-138 (median: 78) months after relapse. The overall probability of a second event free survival (P-2.EFS) and survival after relapse was 0.28 and 0.33 respectively. The probability of remaining in second remission at 11 years was significantly correlated to the duration of first remission (P < 0.001), the site of relapse (P < 0.001) and gender (P = 0.004). The P-2.EFS for early, intermediate, and late bone marrow involved relapses were 0.08, 0.19, and 0.50 respectively. For early, intermediate and late isolated CNS relapses the P-2.EFS were 0.21, 0.38 and 0.61, respectively. The P-2.EFS for boys with isolated testicular relapses was 0.69. Girls with isolated CNS relapse (P < 0.001) and with bone marrow involved relapse (P = 0.04) had a significantly better prognosis than boys. Children with initial high risk criteria, especially T-ALL and mediastinal mass who relapsed, had a very poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, about 30% of children with ALL obtained a long second remission and possible cure.","['Schroeder, H', 'Garwicz, S', 'Kristinsson, J', 'Siimes, M A', 'Wesenberg, F', 'Gustafsson, G']","['Schroeder H', 'Garwicz S', 'Kristinsson J', 'Siimes MA', 'Wesenberg F', 'Gustafsson G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Neoplasms/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology/therapy', 'Population Surveillance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950250503 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1995 Nov;25(5):372-8. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950250503.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In combined intraperitoneal injection with vinblastine (200 micrograms kg-1) into P388/ADR-bearing mice, NA-382 in a suspension form (10 mg kg-1) prolonged the life-span of the mice near to that of P388/S-bearing mice treated with vinblastine alone, but verapamil even at the maximum tolerated dosage (30 mg kg-1) barely affected the in-vivo antitumour effect of vinblastine. When simultaneously administered with vinblastine to P388/ADR-bearing mice, NA-382 maintained significantly higher vinblastine levels in the tumour cells for 24 h and gave a larger area under the time-intracellular vinblastine concentration curve (0 to 24 h) than those receiving vinblastine alone, with long retention of the agent in ascitic fluid. Verapamil increased the cellular vinblastine content for only 6 h, accompanying a rapid elimination of the agent from the ascitic fluid.

All-trans-retinoic acid increased both ChAT and VAChT mRNA levels in SN56 cells up to 3.5-fold, and elevated intracellular ACh levels by 2.5-fold. This effect was mimicked by a retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) agonist (Ro 40-6055) and prevented by a specific antagonist (Ro 41-5253), indicating that it was mediated by RAR alpha. ChAT- and VAChT-specific transcripts were also induced (up to 3-fold) by treatment with CNTF or LIF (20 ng/ml, 48 h), as well as by dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM). All these agents increased the ACh level in the cells (up to 2.5-fold). Dibutyryl cAMP had a greater effect on the level of VAChT mRNA (4-fold induction) than on the level of ChAT mRNA (2-fold induction), suggesting a quantitatively differential transcriptional regulation of the two genes by the cAMP pathway. The effects of the three groups of agents studied on ChAT and VAChT mRNA levels were additive, pointing to several independent mechanisms by which the cholinergic properties of septal neurons can be modulated.","['Berse, B', 'Blusztajn, J K']","['Berse B', 'Blusztajn JK']","['Department of Pathology, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Genes', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Hybrid Cells', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', '*Up-Regulation', 'Vesicular Acetylcholine Transport Proteins', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins']",1995/09/22 00:00,1995/09/22 00:01,['1995/09/22 00:00'],"['1995/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.38.22101 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)90104-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Sep 22;270(38):22101-4. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.38.22101.,['AG09525/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Slc18a3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Vesicular Acetylcholine Transport Proteins)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-two patients with brain metastases were randomized to 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions of 2.5 Gy or to the same dose with BrdUrd 0.8 g/m2 per day for 4 days of each of 3 weeks. Drug treatment was begun on Thursday or Friday before the first week of radiotherapy. Patients had a Karnofsky performance score of at least 70, a neurological function classification of 1 or 2, and any primary tumor except central nervous system (CNS), leukemia, or lymphoma. The primary was absent, controlled, or under active radiotherapy. Patients were free of other metastases. They were stratified by primary site (breast, lung or other), number of metastases (single or multiple) and age (< 60 vs. > 60). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two treatment arms (p = 0.904). The study was open from October 1989 to March 1993 and accrued 72 patients. Only one patient in the RT only arm remains alive. The two treatment arms were balanced with respect to all stratification variables. Toxicity due to radiotherapy was similar in both arms. BrdUrd caused significant Grade 4 and 5 hematologic and skin toxicity in five patients. Two patients died due to hematologic toxicity and one from a Stevens-Johnson type skin reaction. Phenytoin played a role in the skin reactions and ranitidine was associated with the hematologic deaths. Ranitidine was eliminated, BrdUrd was discontinued after any hematologic toxicity, and no further Grade 4 or 5 toxicities were seen. The median survival was 6.12 months in the radiotherapy group and 4.3 in the BrdUrd group (p = 0.904). Patients with solitary brain metastases had significantly better survival (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: BrdUrd did not enhance the efficacy of the radiotherapy regimen tested, in spite of the fact that brain metastases have shown high labeling indices. The toxicity of this schedule of BrdUrd administration was apparently increased by ranitidine and phenytoin.","['Phillips, T L', 'Scott, C B', 'Leibel, S A', 'Rotman, M', 'Weigensberg, I J']","['Phillips TL', 'Scott CB', 'Leibel SA', 'Rotman M', 'Weigensberg IJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy/secondary', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/09/30 00:00,1995/09/30 00:01,['1995/09/30 00:00'],"['1995/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(95)00168-X [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(95)00168-X [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Sep 30;33(2):339-48. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(95)00168-X.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact remains that these are the tumors that pathologists are seeing and diagnosing, and oncologists must be prepared to deal with them. If several morphologically, immunologically and genetically distinct neoplasms prove to respond identically to currently available treatment, the can be ""lumped"" for the purposes of clinical treatment selection (see Table 11-3). However, if new forms of treatment become available, particularly if these are directed against antigenic or genetic features, it will be important to recognize and study each disease separately. This study should be regarded as a preliminary effort to develop a consensus on lymphoma categorization, and constitutes merely a framework for further study. The ILSG has not attempted to determine the reproducibility of diagnosis of the various categories, either among different pathologists or by the same pathologist over time. No prior tumor classification has been based on reproducibility and when such studies have been done with existing classifications of lymphoma, they have shown disappointing results. 1,35,119 It is likely that recognition of clearly defined entities, which have characteristic immunophenotypes and in some cases genetic features, as well a characteristics morphology, will facilitate reproducibility among pathologists.189 Formal reproducibility studies should be undertaken, and should in general be a more frequent activity in the pathologic diagnosis of tumors. The ILSG does not have the resources to make a systematic attempt to determine the utility of these histologically and immunologically defined categories in predicting clinical outcome. The task of the pathologist is to attempt to define diseases by morphologic and other criteria applied to tissue specimens, and this has been the goal of the current endeavor. The clinical information about the different entities is taken from studies already published, which clearly show that each of the entities has distinctive clinical behavior, even if distinctive treatments are not currently available. The joint task of clinical oncologist and hematopathologists now is to undertake systematic application of the criteria presented here to defined groups of patients, to determine whether the newly-recognized categories will help to further stratify treatment response and outcome in clinical trials. Several members of the ILSG have already begun to review cases in cooperative group trials, and have found the recognition of these entities within broad Working Formulation categories can have prognostic implications (Grogan, T and Banks, PM, unpublished data from the Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Harris, N L']",['Harris NL'],"['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Important Adv Oncol,Important advances in oncology,8505229,IM,"['Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Male']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Important Adv Oncol. 1995:111-40.,,,189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with myelodysplasia have a propensity (20% to 30% of cases) to undergo transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and a large body of evidence indicates that MDS represent steps in the multiphasic evolution of AML. Progression of the disease is characterized by expansion of the abnormal clone and inhibition of normal hematopoiesis leading to deterioration of the blood cell count and/or development of AML. MDS are relatively unusual in childhood, representing only 3% of pediatric hematological malignancies, although it has been reported that up to 17% of pediatric AML cases may have a previous myelodysplastic phase. The first systematic attempt at morphological classification of MDS was provided by the French-American-British (FAB) group. However, the FAB classification of MDS is only partially applicable in children. Some variants are extremely rare or absent (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), and other peculiar pediatric disorders, represented by juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) and the monosomy 7 syndrome, are not included. Moreover, since there is a partial overlap between pediatric MDS and myeloproliferative disorders and the variants occurring in young children have rather specific features, some confusion still surrounds the nosographical definition of childhood MDS, so that none of the proposed classifications are widely accepted and used. Characteristically, some genetic conditions such as Fanconi's anemia, Shwachman's and Down's syndromes predispose to the development of MDS in childhood. The most common variants of childhood MDS are represented by JCML and the monosomy 7 syndrome, both disorders typically occurring in young children. JCML is characterized by a spontaneous growth of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors that show a striking hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Clinical presentation resembles that of some myeloproliferative disorders, with massive organomegaly usually not observed in the classically reported variants of MDS. Clinical features of the monosomy 7 syndrome resemble those observed in JCML and a differential diagnosis between these two entities relies upon the higher percentage of fetal hemoglobin, the more pronounced decrease in platelet count and, in some cases, the lack of the peculiar cytogenetic abnormality in the latter. With the number of children being cured of cancer constantly rising, a significant increase in secondary or chemotherapy-related myelodysplasia is being observed, and these disorders represent a formidable challenge for pediatric hematologists due to their poor response to chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Locatelli, F', 'Zecca, M', 'Pession, A', 'Maserati, E', 'De Stefano, P', 'Severi, F']","['Locatelli F', 'Zecca M', 'Pession A', 'Maserati E', 'De Stefano P', 'Severi F']","['Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/genetics/therapy']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1995 May-Jun;80(3):268-79.,,,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutropenia is common and several morphologic and functional abnormalities of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMNs) and/or monocytes have been described. On the basis of these observations, the phagocytic and oxygen intermediates production of PMNs and monocytes was determined in a group of forty-seven patients affected by myelodysplastic syndromes of varying severity. METHODS: A rapid, simple and reliable flow cytometric method was developed to evaluate, in a one-step procedure, the phagocytosis rate and the oxidative burst in PMNs and monocytes using a small amount of whole blood. RESULTS: Phagocytosis of PMNs and monocytes was not significantly reduced in refractory anemia (RA), while in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) a clear decrease (p < 0.05) of this function was found in both PMNs and monocytes. The production of oxygen intermediates by PMNs and monocytes was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced in RA as well as in RAEB and in CMML. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the presence in myelodysplastic syndromes of a severe reduction in phagocytosis and oxygen intermediates production (two crucial functions to protect the host against pyogenic agents) in both PMNs and monocytes. This observation could explain the severe morbidity and mortality from infections in patients affected by these hematological malignancies.","['Prodan, M', 'Tulissi, P', 'Perticarari, S', 'Presani, G', 'Franzin, F', 'Pussini, E', 'Pozzato, G']","['Prodan M', 'Tulissi P', 'Perticarari S', 'Presani G', 'Franzin F', 'Pussini E', 'Pozzato G']","['Istituto di Medicina Clinica, University of Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis/*physiology', 'Respiratory Burst/*physiology']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1995 May-Jun;80(3):212-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current studies of some of these NID syndromes suggest that the primary cause of neuronal and T cell death is an imbalanced cytokine signaling system with a dysfunctional redox status, and that the loss of T cells and neurons may be secondary to impaired functions of their accessory supportive cells. These dysfunctions include inappropriate production of developmental cytokines, inadequate secretion of reductants, and disregulation of excitotoxic amino acid metabolism. Two examples of pediatric NID in humans are ataxia telangiectasia and pediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection. An animal model is retrovirus-induced T and neuronal cell loss in neonatal mice infected with a neuroimmunopathogenic mutant, ts1, of the Moloney murine leukemia virus. Because both thymic and neuronal components share many growth factors and developmental signals, it is likely that disregulation of these signals would lead to concomitant dysfunction of neuronal and thymic cells. In this review, we focus on the pathogenic mechanisms involved in these developmental NID syndromes with the objective of identifying common pathogenic factors and pathways responsible for the concurrent losses of both neurons and T cells.","['Lynn, W S', 'Wong, P K']","['Lynn WS', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville 78957, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'Cell Death', 'Humans', '*Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.9.12.7672507 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1995 Sep;9(12):1147-56. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.9.12.7672507.,"['16672/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we developed a radioimmunoassay specific for cADPR, by which more than 100 fmol of cADPR could be detected without any interference by other nucleotides. The possible involvement of CD38 in the formation of cellular cADPR was investigated with the radioimmunoassay method. A marked increase in cellular cADPR was accompanied by all-trans-RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Moreover, a high level of cellular cADPR was observed in other leukemic cell lines, in which CD38 mRNA was expressed. Thus, CD38, which was initially identified as an NADase, appeared to be responsible for the formation of cellular cADPR.","['Takahashi, K', 'Kukimoto, I', 'Tokita, K', 'Inageda, K', 'Inoue, S', 'Kontani, K', 'Hoshino, S', 'Nishina, H', 'Kanaho, Y', 'Katada, T']","['Takahashi K', 'Kukimoto I', 'Tokita K', 'Inageda K', 'Inoue S', 'Kontani K', 'Hoshino S', 'Nishina H', 'Kanaho Y', 'Katada T']","['Department of Life Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cyclic ADP-Ribose', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/genetics/physiology', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay/*methods', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/04 00:00,1995/09/04 00:01,['1995/09/04 00:00'],"['1995/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['001457939500914U [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(95)00914-u [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1995 Sep 4;371(2):204-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(95)00914-u.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '119340-53-3 (Cyclic ADP-Ribose)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From January 1982 to December 1986, 148 patients were randomized either to receive immediate treatment with chlorambucil (CLB) or to defer therapy to the time of progression. The early and stable phase of the disease was defined by a total tumor mass (TTM) score < 9, the absence of anemia or thrombocytopenia and a doubling time > 12 months. The main end-point of the study was survival. At the last evaluation in April 1993, after a median follow-up of 75 months, no significant difference was found in overall survival between early vs. deferred treatment patients from every cause of death as well as from death due to CLL-related causes only. The same results were obtained when the patients in more favorable stages, such as Binet stage A and TTM < 4.5, were considered.

Prior addition of verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) to the cells abolished the serotonin-induced response, suggesting that the diminution of free [Ca2+]i contents was due to the opening of calcium channels. Thapsigargin (an agent which increases [Ca2+]i via its action on endoplasmic reticulum) augmented the [Ca2+]i contents. Addition of serotonin before or after thapsigargin (THAP) curtailed the THAP-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i, supporting the notion that 5-HT acts on the calcium channels and that it empties, in part, the THAP-stimulated calcium contents. Spiperone and NAN-190, antagonists to 5-HT1A receptor subtype, abolished the serotonin effects on calcium signaling, whereas an agonist to 5-HT1A receptor, 8OHDPAT, mimicked the serotonin-like action on the diminution of the intracellular calcium contents. These results indicate that the 5-HT response is mediated via 5-HT1A serotonergic receptors in these cells. Furthermore, we characterized the 5-HT receptors in K 562 cells. The specific binding of serotonin to these cells was saturable and hyperbolic. The Kd and the Bmax of serotonin binding were 100 nM and 1690 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. 8-[3H]OH-DPAT also labeled these cells with a Bmax of 2.8 fmol/10(6) cells and a Kd of 20 nM. The specific binding of 8-[3H]OH-DPAT to K 562 cells was displaced by serotonin, 8OH-DPAT, and NAN-190.

In the present report we describe that in human erythroleukemic cells, aspirin (400 microM), when administered during or immediately after a hyperthermic treatment, causes an increase in the amount of HSP70 synthesized and prolongs HSP70 synthesis for a period of several hours. This effect is not due to increased HSP70 mRNA stability. In the presence of aspirin, the heat shock transcription factor is maintained in the activated DNA-binding state for a period twice as long as control, an effect which results in enhanced and prolonged HSP70 mRNA transcription. A different cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10(-7) M), also provokes similar effects. The modulation of the heat shock response by aspirin and indomethacin is associated with the ability of these drugs to potentiate the effect of hyperthermia and prolong thermotolerance for a period of 48 h. These results indicate that the use of aspirin and indomethacin should be carefully monitored in cancer patients undergoing hyperthermic treatment. On the other hand, the ability of aspirin to enhance HSP70 synthesis suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could potentiate the cytoprotective role of HSPs in pathological states, including fever, inflammation, and ischemia.","['Amici, C', 'Rossi, A', 'Santoro, M G']","['Amici C', 'Rossi A', 'Santoro MG']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Body Temperature Regulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Oct 1;55(19):4452-7.,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas previous investigations have examined the interaction of hydroxyurea with this enzyme, the action of hydroxyurea on other aspects of iron metabolism has not been studied in detail. In our study, incubation of CCRF-CEM cells with hydroxyurea resulted in an inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity/DNA synthesis within 4 h and produced a parallel decrease in the uptake of iron by cells. In contrast, iron uptake by hydroxyurea-resistant CCRF-CEM cells was not inhibited by hydroxyurea. After 6 h, hydroxyurea produced an increase in the activity of the iron-regulatory protein, a cytoplasmic mRNA-binding protein responsible for regulating the translation of transferrin receptor and ferritin mRNAs. After 24 h, hydroxyurea-treated cells displayed a 1.5-fold increase in transferrin receptor mRNA and protein and a significant decrease in ferritin levels. The hydroxyurea-induced increase in transferrin receptor was abrogated by transferrin-iron. In contrast to hydroxyurea, inhibition of DNA synthesis by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine produced a decrease in transferrin receptor expression. Our studies suggest that iron uptake by CCRF-CEM cells is closely linked to ribonucleotide reductase activity rather than to transferrin receptor number. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase/DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea results in a decrease in iron uptake by cells and an increase in the activity of the iron-regulatory protein, which, in turn, is responsible for the hydroxyurea-induced increase in transferrin receptor and decrease in ferritin synthesis.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Wereley, J P']","['Chitambar CR', 'Wereley JP']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Ferritins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Oct 1;55(19):4361-6.,['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported previously (Cancer Res. 52: 2782-2790, 1992) that WEHI-3B/NOVO cells exhibit a pronounced decrease in VP-16 induced DNA-topo II cross-link formation compared to the parental WEHI-3B/S cell line in intact cells, in the absence of a significant difference in the P4 unknotting activity of topo II assayed in nuclear extracts. Because the pattern of cross-resistance was suggestive of a topo II-mediated mechanism, we have ascertained whether a change in topo II can account for the multidrug-resistant phenotype of WEHI-3B/NOVO cells. No differences existed between WEHI-3B/S and WEHI-3B/NOVO cells in topo II mRNA and protein levels, as well as in the amount of topo II associated with the nuclear matrix. Neither sensitive nor resistant cells expressed detectable levels of the MDR1 gene; however, VP-16 accumulation in WEHI-3B/NOVO cells was 3-4-fold less than that present in WEHI-3B/S cells, whereas doxorubicin accumulation was the same in both cell lines. Over the first 60 s, no difference existed in the rate of uptake of VP-16 between parental and resistant cells; however, beyond the first 60 s of incubation, [3H]VP-16 accumulated to a greater extent in parental sensitive cells. Thus, an increased rate of efflux of VP-16 was responsible for the lower steady-state concentration of the drug in resistant cells. The efflux Km for VP-16 in WEHI-3B/NOVO cells was 254.7 microM and the Vmax was 10.4 pmol/s/10(7) cells. In the presence of the inhibitors of energy metabolism, sodium azide and deoxyglucose, the efflux of VP-16 was markedly inhibited; readdition of glucose restored the original efflux rate. Northern blot analyses using the human 10.1 probe for the 3'-terminal region of the multidrug-resistance protein (MRP) cDNA revealed a mRNA species of approximately 6 kb in WEHI-3B/NOVO cells but not in WEHI-3B/S cells. Overexpression was associated with amplification of the cognate gene. To ascertain whether the overexpressed gene in WEHI-3B/NOVO cells was the murine MRP or a different member of the same superfamily of ATP-binding ABC cassette transporters, a 341-bp MRP cDNA probe was generated from a murine genomic library.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Lorico, A', 'Rappa, G', 'Srimatkandada, S', 'Catapano, C V', 'Fernandes, D J', 'Germino, J F', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Lorico A', 'Rappa G', 'Srimatkandada S', 'Catapano CV', 'Fernandes DJ', 'Germino JF', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacokinetics', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Novobiocin/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Matrix/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Oct 1;55(19):4352-60.,['CA-44597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data demonstrate for the first time that transfer of foreign DNA to fetal lung can be accomplished. These findings support the use of retroviral vectors for somatic lung DNA transfer and suggest that inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis may be approached therapeutically via gene transfer, in utero.","['Pitt, B R', 'Schwarz, M A', 'Pilewski, J M', 'Nakayama, D', 'Mueller, G M', 'Robbins, P D', 'Watkins, S A', 'Albertine, K H', 'Bland, R D']","['Pitt BR', 'Schwarz MA', 'Pilewski JM', 'Nakayama D', 'Mueller GM', 'Robbins PD', 'Watkins SA', 'Albertine KH', 'Bland RD']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Lac Operon', 'Lung/cytology/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/genetics/therapy', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sheep/embryology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1995 Jul;2(5):344-50.,"['DK 44935/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-32154/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we explore the potential of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for human beta-globin gene transfer. We have constructed a recombinant AAV-vector containing a human beta-globin gene together with the DNasel hypersensitive sites 4, 3 and 2 of the human beta-globin locus control region. The vector replicates to high titers and can efficiently transduce hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. In transduced and G418 selected murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell clones, human beta-globin gene expression was regulated and reached levels comparable to endogenous murine beta maj.

However, the clinical application of rhGM-CSF in patients with AML has been limited by its potential stimulatory effect on the malignant clone. Here we report the effect of rhGM-CSF 5 micrograms/kg/day infusion on AK cell function in 20 patients with AML undergoing autologous BMT. AK cell function was investigated before autologous BMT, during rhGM-CSF therapy and after withdrawal. In addition, its influence on the actuarial risk of relapse is analyzed and compared with a historical control group of 20 patients transplanted immediately before initiation of this study. rhGM-CSF significantly enhanced AK cell function. During rhGM-CSF treatment, median AK cell function rose from 1.8% before autologous BMT (range 0-8%) to 35% (range 3-80%) and remained increased after cessation of rhGM-CSF (median 20%; range 0-36%; P < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 24 months, the actuarial risk of relapse is 37.4% in rhGM-CSF-treated patients compared with 49.5% in controls (P = 0.05). Interestingly, none of the 7 patients with an AK cell activity > or = 20% in the first 2-5 weeks after autologous BMT have relapsed compared with 6 of 9 patients with an AK cell activity < 20% (P < 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Richard, C', 'Baro, J', 'Bello-Fernandez, C', 'Hermida, G', 'Calavia, J', 'Olalla, I', 'Alsar, M J', 'Loyola, I', 'Cuadrado, M A', 'Iriondo, A']","['Richard C', 'Baro J', 'Bello-Fernandez C', 'Hermida G', 'Calavia J', 'Olalla I', 'Alsar MJ', 'Loyola I', 'Cuadrado MA', 'Iriondo A', 'et al.']","['Hematology Department of Marques de Valdecilla University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1995 May;15(5):721-6.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two-cell mouse embryos were cultured to blastocyst in Ham's F-10 with 15% human cord serum (control) or with the coculture cells. Northern analysis demonstrated expression of LIF mRNA in Vero cells and embryonic fibroblasts but not in placental fibroblasts. Development to blastocyst was significantly enhanced in two-cell embryos cultured with Vero cells (86%, 140/163) and embryonic fibroblasts (83%, 118/142) when compared to controls (71%, 67/94, P < 0.05) or placental fibroblasts (71%, 95/134), P < 0.05).

The ATP luminescence assay allows discrimination of MTX sensitivity between breast carcinomas and has considerable technical advantages over the cloning assay.","['Cree, I A', 'Pazzagli, M', 'Mini, E', 'Mazzei, T', 'Hunter, E M', 'Sutherland, L A', 'Pinzani, P', 'Gerli, A', 'Andreotti, P E']","['Cree IA', 'Pazzagli M', 'Mini E', 'Mazzei T', 'Hunter EM', 'Sutherland LA', 'Pinzani P', 'Gerli A', 'Andreotti PE']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199506000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1995 Jun;6(3):398-404. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199506000-00006.,,"['8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Affected persons often die before 30 years of age. Bone marrow transplantation is an effective treatment, but there are few data regarding factors associated with transplant outcome. We analyzed outcomes of HLA-identical sibling (N = 151) or alternative related or unrelated donor (N = 48) bone marrow transplants for Fanconi anemia performed between 1978 and 1994 and reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. Fanconi anemia was documented by cytogenetic studies in all cases. Patient, disease, and treatment factors associated with survival were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression. Two-year probabilities (95% confidence interval) of survival were 66% (58% to 73%) after HLA-identical siblings transplants and 29% (18% to 43%) after alternative donor transplants. Younger patient age (P .0001), higher pretransplant platelet counts (P = .04), use of antithymocyte globulin (P = .005), and use of low-dose (15 to 25 mg/kg) cyclophosphamide plus limited field irradiation (P = .009) for pretransplant conditioning and cyclosporine for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis (P = .002) were associated with increased survival.

Consequently, a broad range of toxicities are experienced by patients, especially myelosuppression. Amifostine, a phosphorylated aminothiol, increases the selectivity of specific anticancer drugs for neoplastic cells by protecting normal tissues. One potential application of this protector is during bone marrow purging to selectively remove contaminating cancer cells. This study took normal or leukemic marrow from human subjects and evaluated the ability of amifostine to selectively protect normal bone marrow progenitor cells versus leukemic progenitor cells from the cytotoxic effect of mafosfamide. The dose response of mafosfamide amifostine on leukemia colony-forming units or normal marrow progenitor cells was determined and the LD95 was calculated. Amifostine pretreatment resulted in a statistically significant protection of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid blast-forming units from the toxicity of mafosfamide (P = .031). Thus, amifostine protection of normal marrow progenitor cells allows a higher LD95 concentration of mafosfamide to be used in ex vivo purging. In contrast, amifostine pretreatment increased the cytotoxicity of mafosfamide on the fresh human leukemia progenitor cells (P = .006). The dual effect of amifostine protection of normal marrow progenitor cells coupled with amifostine-induced sensitization of the leukemia cells increases the possible cell-kill of leukemic stem cells. With amifostine pretreatment, at the LD95 concentrations of mafosfamide for marrow progenitor cells, there was an estimated 6 log increase in cell-kill of the leukemia cells. This selective cell-kill offers the potential for lowering the incidence of leukemic relapse, while preserving more normal stem cells for autologous transplantation.","['Douay, L', 'Hu, C', 'Giarratana, M C', 'Bouchet, S', 'Conlon, J', 'Capizzi, R L', 'Gorin, N C']","['Douay L', 'Hu C', 'Giarratana MC', 'Bouchet S', 'Conlon J', 'Capizzi RL', 'Gorin NC']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Hopital d'enfants Armand Trousseau, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Death', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68745-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Oct 1;86(7):2849-55.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different T-cell subsets from the bone marrow (BM) graft may be responsible for GVHD and GVL reactivity after BMT. In the etiology of GVHD, not only CD8+ but also CD4+ donor T lymphocytes may play an important role. Here we report a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who was transplanted with the BM from his HLA-genotypically identical sister. After BMT there was complete engraftment, but the patient died because of acute GVHD grade III-IV in complete remission. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines were generated after BMT using the irradiated leukemic cells from the patient as stimulator cells and the donor-originated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, procured from the patient after BMT, as responder cells. The generated CTL lines showed specific lysis of the recipient lymphocytes and leukemic cells in a 51Cr release assay. Two types of CTL clones could be established from these CTL lines, both phenotypically CD4+. Clone type I showed male-specific HLA-DQ5-restricted lysis of the recipient lymphocytes, but not of the circulating relatively mature leukemic cells from the patient. This may be explained by the low HLA-DQ5 expression of the more mature CML cells. Clone type II showed HLA-DR2-restricted minor histocompatibility antigen-specific lysis of the recipient lymphocytes and leukemic cells. Both types of CTL clones showed antigen-specific cell-mediated growth inhibition of the recipient clonogenic leukemic precursor cells. These CD4+ CTL clones produced several activating cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and macrophage CSF. Our results illustrate that these CD4+ CTL clones may have induced GVHD directly by cytolysis and indirectly by activating cytokines. Because both types of CTL clones recognized the recipient leukemic progenitor cells, they may also contribute to GVL reactivity after BMT.","['Faber, L M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Veenhof, W F', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Faber LM', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Veenhof WF', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'HLA-DR2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68741-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Oct 1;86(7):2821-8.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQw5 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR2 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DT390-mGM-CSF hybrid gene was cloned into a vector under the control of an inducible promoter and the protein expressed in Escherichia coli. After induction, a protein was purified from inclusion bodies in accord with the deduced molecular weight of DT390 mGM-CSF. Cell-free studies of the adenosine diphosphate-ribosylating activity of DT390 mGM-CSF showed results that were similar to those of native DT. The DT390 mGM-CSF immunotoxin inhibited FDCP2.1d, a murine myelomonocytic tumor line expressing the GM-CSF receptor with an IC50 (concentration inhibiting 50% activity) of 5 x 10(-11) mol/L. The fusion toxin was specifically cytotoxic and directed by the GM-CSF portion of the molecule because addition of a monoclonal antibody directed against GM-CSF inhibited its ability to kill the cell line. Cell lines that do not express GM-CSF receptor were not inhibited by the fusion toxin. DT390 mGM-CSF was also able to specifically inhibit normal committed bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells as measured in clonal colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage assays. Together, these findings indicate that DT390 mGM-CSF may be useful as a novel tool for purging BM of contaminating leukemia cells or in vivo for eliminating residual leukemia cells. Also, it can be used to determine whether committed and/or noncommitted BM progenitor cells express the GM-CSF receptor.","['Chan, C H', 'Blazar, B R', 'Eide, C R', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Vallera, D A']","['Chan CH', 'Blazar BR', 'Eide CR', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Vallera DA']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinics, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', '*Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68730-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Oct 1;86(7):2732-40.,"['R01-CA31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MELC induced with 5 mmol/L hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), in addition to expression of known markers of the erythroid phenotype, were also found to exhibit traits of the megakaryocytic lineage. Erythroid differentiation was shown by the typical synthesis and accumulation of hemoglobin (Hb); megakaryoblastoid differentiation of MELCs upon induction was shown by increased specific activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Incubation of MELCs with 5 mmol/L HMBA in RPMI supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) (instead of the usual 5%), induced cells to selectively express high levels of AChE (up to approximately 170 mU/mg protein) with little activation of Hb synthesis (less than 5% B+ cells). The increase in AChE levels was a general phenomenon affecting the whole cell population and approached its maximum within 3 days of incubation with the inducer. Subsequently, MELCs become committed to terminal division, undergoing growth arrest and expression of the megakaryocytic phenotype even after the removal of HMBA. There were no appreciable changes of basal AChE levels in MELCs that were either made resistant to HMBA or treated with 0.1 mmol/L hemin that activated differentiated erythroid function without commitment. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), known to repress induced Hb synthesis in these cells, did not prevent the full increase in AChE when incubated with MELCs 2 days before HMBA addition. HMBA-induced MELCs always underwent AChE increase that was more or less pronounced depending on the low or high serum content in culture, respectively. Conversely, Hb expression was permitted only when MELCs were transferred in the late phase or at the end of commitment from low to high serum media. Variations of FCS content in culture media proved to be a simple and reliable approach to change the MELC response to inducers and to modulate expression of either megakaryocytic or mixed erythromegakaryocytic phenotype. These findings suggested that MELC might be considered, at least, as a bipotential model of differentiation to be used for studies on regulation of either megakaryocytic or erythroid markers and on competition between the two hematopoietic lineages. In this regard, it was intriguing that AChE levels attained under selective induction (low serum) were always higher than under conditions allowing coexpression of both AChE and Hb (high serum).

To study the role of retinoid resistance on the response to these agents, we investigated their effects in HL-60 cells, retinoid-resistant HL-60R cells, and HL-60R+ cells in which retinoid sensitivity has been restored. In HL-60 cells, cathepsin D (ctsd) mRNA levels are increased by these agents and by cholera toxin after pretreatment with each agent. Calcitriol, 9 cis-RA, and sodium butyrate increase interleukin-8 (IL-8) mRNA expression, and pretreatment with these agents or RA potentiates the stimulation of IL-8 by phorbol ester (TPA). Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with all of the agents confers inducibility of cathepsin L (ctsl) mRNA by TPA in previously unresponsive cells. In HL-60R cells, none of the agents alone or in combination significantly enhances the expression of the ctsd, IL-8, or ctsl mRNAs. Retinoid stimulation (either alone or in combination with the other agents) of the three mRNAs is partially restored in the HL-60R+ cells. Calcitriol does not alter the expression of any of these mRNAs, and only the stimulation of IL-8 mRNA by sodium butyrate is recovered. Treatment with all of the agents inhibits proliferation and stimulates differentiation of the HL-60 cells. RA and calcitriol are unable to inhibit proliferation of the HL-60R cells, whereas only calcitriol fails to inhibit proliferation of the HL-60R+ cells. None of the agents induces differentiation in either the HL-60R or HL-60R+ cells. Therefore, the mutation of the RA receptor alpha is insufficient to account for the altered responses of the HL-60R cells, and there are likely defects in other signaling pathways in these cells. These cells may prove useful in examining the mechanism of cross-resistance between various differentiating agents.","['Atkins, K B', 'Troen, B R']","['Atkins KB', 'Troen BR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cathepsin D/genetics', 'Cathepsin L', 'Cathepsins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Drug Resistance', '*Endopeptidases', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68700-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Oct 1;86(7):2475-80.,"['CA53910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P60-DK20572/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (CTSL protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Cathepsin L)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A radiation-free protocol containing Mitobronitol (DBM), Cytarabine (Ara-C) and Cyclophosphamide (Cy) was used for conditioning of patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL). Using this conditioning treatment, fewer transplant related complications, including acute GVHD, VOD and severe infections, were observed. Acute GVHD did not develop, but chronic GVHD, accompanied with graft-versus leukemia, was present in half of the cases. To determine the clinical effect of the DBM/Ara-C/Cy conditioning, the recovery of peripheral blood lymphocytes was examined after allogeneic BMT for patients with CGL in comparison with TBI/Cy conditioning. The lymphocyte subsets of 11 DBM patients were followed and analyzed periodically (30-90 days, 4-12 months and > 13 months) using ten monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. Decreased percentage of total T cells as well as CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations, significantly decreased T cell activation and increased proportion of TCR gamma delta + cells were found to be characteristic in the early post-transplant period in the DBM group. Early recovery and consistently higher percentage of B cells were observed for the whole follow-up period of patients receiving DBM conditioning. A high proportion of NK cells was observed in all transplant recipients. These findings suggest that the characteristic pattern of recovering lymphocytes is associated with the lack of severe transplant-related clinical complications following DBM/Ara-C/Cy conditioning.","['Milosevits, J', 'Denes, R', 'Poros, A', 'Remenyi, P', 'Batai, A', 'Barta, A', 'Masszi, T', 'Lengyel, L', 'Jakab, K', 'Foldi, J']","['Milosevits J', 'Denes R', 'Poros A', 'Remenyi P', 'Batai A', 'Barta A', 'Masszi T', 'Lengyel L', 'Jakab K', 'Foldi J', 'et al.']","['National Institute of Haematology, Blood Transfusion and Immunology, Semmelweis University Medical School, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0925571095003775 [pii]', '10.1016/0925-5710(95)00377-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1995 Jul;62(1):27-33. doi: 10.1016/0925-5710(95)00377-5.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect and the mechanism of action of phorbol ester (TPA) on the expression of ctsl mRNA in U937 histiocytic leukemia cells. TPA treatment induces ctsl mRNA in a manner that is dose-dependent, occurs at the level of transcription, and is ablated by cotreatment with cycloheximide but is unaffected by dexamethasone. Treatment with TPA plus staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, results in greater expression of ctsl mRNA than does treatment with TPA alone. Similar to TPA, staurosporine alone increases ctsl transcription, an effect that is inhibited by cycloheximide. Another PKC inhibitor, H7, exerted no effect upon the induction of ctsl mRNA by either TPA or staurosporine. Staurosporine and H7, however, inhibit the increase in c-jun mRNA by TPA. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein inhibit the effect of TPA and staurosporine upon ctsl mRNA with little or no effect on c-jun expression. Pretreatment with sodium orthovanadate enhances the induction of ctsl expression by TPA and staurosporine. These data suggest that, in U937 cells, TPA-stimulated ctsl gene transcription is apparently activated by a protein kinase C-independent signal transduction pathway involving tyrosine kinase activation.","['Atkins, K B', 'Troen, B R']","['Atkins KB', 'Troen BR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Cathepsin L', 'Cathepsins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Drug Interactions', '*Endopeptidases', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1995 Jun;6(6):713-8.,['CA53910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (CTSL protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Cathepsin L)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'ctsL']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Withdrawal of DEX after up-regulation of bcl-XL resulted in a decrease in bcl-XL expression and a concomitant increase in cell susceptibility to induction of apoptosis. Another myeloid leukemia that shows barely detectable expression of bcl-2 also showed up-regulated expression of bcl-XL but no change in bax after induction of differentiation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and this reduced cell susceptibility to induction of apoptosis by Adriamycin or cycloheximide.

Groupe Francais d'Hematologie Cellulaire.,868-75,"We describe eight cases of erythroleukaemia distinct from FAB-AML M6, which demonstrate minimal erythroid differentiation not associated with a myeloblastic component. Three infants (including a Down's syndrome) and two adults presented with a de novo leukaemia. One case was preceded by an untreated refractory anaemia with excess of blasts and one by polycythaemia vera. One case presented with an inaugural blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukaemia. In four patients the leukaemic cells showed a proerythroblast-like morphology. The four other were initially classified as undifferentiated AL (two cases) or AML MO (two cases) because of the immature aspect of the cells, their lack of myeloperoxidase activity and the absence of B, T lymphoid and myeloid (My) marker expressions apart from the CD33 antigen. Immunophenotyping in three cases showed an immature erythroblast profile (glycophorins A and B+, spectrin+). In the five others the erythroid nature was recognized by the expression of ABH blood group system on fresh cells (four cases) and glycophorin A on cells after 3 d in vitro culture with erythropoietin (EPO) + IL3 (two cases). Moreover, an erythroid colony growth of leukaemic origin was observed in three patients. In conclusion, the study of erythroid marker expression is of particular importance when immunophenotyping leukaemic cells with a proerythroblast-like morphology or an undifferentiated aspect and a HLA DR-, CD36++, B-, T-, My- (CD33 +/-) phenotype.

The gene involved. Mixed Lineage Leukaemia (MLL), has been identified and has the characteristics of a transcription factor. The BCL-2 gene responsible for blocking of programmed cell death is highly expressed in a number of haematological malignancies, both with and without the t(14;18) translocation. Those without the translocation include acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In these diseases the BCL-2 protein is implicated in drug resistance to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agents. High BCL-2 expression is also associated with autonomous growth of leukaemic blasts in culture and predicts a poor prognosis. The SEM cell line, established using blood lymphoblasts from a 5-year-old girl in first relapse with t(4;11) ALL, expresses lymphoid (CD19) and myeloid (CD13) cell surface markers. In cell culture, a subpopulation of cells (< 30%) express the BCL-2 protein. A reproducible model of true biphenotypic leukaemia in the SCID mouse has been established using the SEM-K2 cell line (a subclone of the SEM cell line). Between 5 and 50 million cells injected intravenously (i.v.) produce complete replacement of the murine bone marrow by day 30, associated with blood lymphoblastosis and infiltration of the spleen. No tumour masses were seen. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the cell line and blood from the SCID-human (SCID-hu) chimaera has confirmed the presence of the t(4;11). Reverse transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reveals that the breakpoint lies between exons 7 and 8 of the MLL-1 gene on chromosome 11 (the main breakpoint region). A further translocation, t(7;13), has been identified. Fluorescent antibody cell sorter (FACS) analysis of tumour material recovered from the SCID-hu model confirms expression of CD19 and CD13 identical to that of the cell line. In addition, BCL-2 expression in SCID-hu marrow is now seen in the majority of tumour cells. BCL-2 expression appears to confer a survival advantage to the blast cells in vivo. This reproducible model of biphenotypic leukaemia suggests that BCL-2 expression may play a role in leukaemogenesis.

Using flow cytometry, we quantified expression levels of CD68 molecules in normal and malignant haemopoietic cells. CD68 molecules are intensely expressed in the cytoplasm and weakly on the surface of mature CD14+ monocytes. CD68 expression seems to start very early during granulomonopoietic differentiation. Virtually all myeloperoxidase (MPO)+ bone marrow cells coexpress CD68 and similar proportions of CD34+ progenitor cells weakly express CD68 or MPO molecules. During further differentiation, CD68 expression is strongly up-regulated in early MPO+ precursor cells which lack lactoferrin (LF) and CD14 molecules. Compared to these, more mature MPO+LF+ bone marrow and peripheral blood granulocytes express considerable lower levels of CD68. In-line with this broad expression, all investigated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases, classified as FAB M1-M5, were CD68 positive, and compared to normal CD34+ bone marrow cells. CD34+ AML blast cells expressed increased levels. CD68 expression is, however, not restricted to cells of myeloid origin, because a subset (40 +/- 15%, n = 6) of CD19+ peripheral blood B-lymphocytes and 50% of B-ALL are also weakly positive. In contrast, normal CD3+ lymphocytes lack (< 3%, n = 6) CD68 and only low proportions (6 +/- 3%, n = 6) of CD56+ NK cells are CD68+.

Limiting dilution analysis and Poisson statistics are necessary for determining the frequency of P delta cells because each of them produces several CFU-GM. Limiting dilution also permits measurement of the abilities of individual P delta progenitors to produce CFU-GM. Here we report that the frequencies of P delta progenitors in cord blood and adult marrow are similar (5.6 and 7.8/10(5) mononuclear cells respectively) and individual cord blood P delta progenitors produce fewer CFU-GM than adult P delta progenitors. To test the possibility that the lower production of differentiated progeny by cord blood cells was the result of a higher rate of self-renewal, we devised a two-stage limiting dilution assay relying on the relative production of CFU-GM after two consecutive weeks of incubation. The probability of progenitor renewal (PPR) was derived from the number of wells (progenitors) that produced CFU-GM on both occasions compared with the number that produced CFU-GM on the first occasion only. The total number of CFU-GM produced on the second occasion compared with the number produced on the first occasion provided an index of the overall change in the size of the P delta cell population. The data indicate that P delta cells in cord blood have a higher PPR (0.59) than those in adult marrow (0.36). Also, the relative numbers of CFU-GM produced in the second and first weeks were greater for cord blood (1.2) than for adult marrow (0.36). Therefore P delta cells in cord blood have a greater capacity for self-maintenance and possibly for expansion than P delta cells in adult marrow.","['Gordon, M Y', 'Lewis, J L', 'Scott, M A', 'Roberts, I A', 'Goldman, J M']","['Gordon MY', 'Lewis JL', 'Scott MA', 'Roberts IA', 'Goldman JM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05191.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Aug;90(4):744-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05191.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The Leder stain (napthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase) was positive in 21 (77.7%) of 27 tumors. Immunohistochemically, the following antibodies reacted with the greatest number of cases: Leu-22 or MT1 (CD43) in 28 (96.6%) of 29, antilysozyme in 27 (96.4%) of 28, and antimyeloperoxidase (MP07) in 21 (91.3%) of 23 cases. Other myeloid lineage-associated antibodies were positive in a subset of cases: antineutrophil elastase (NP57) in 10 (62.5%) of 16, Leu-M1 (CD15) in 7 (46.6%) of 15, and Mac-387 in 6 (40.0%) of 15 cases. The well-differentiated EMCTs reacted with most myeloid-associated antibodies; poorly differentiated and blastic tumors were more often negative. The pan-leukocyte antibody LCA (CD45RB) reacted with 15 (60%) of 25 neoplasms. Three (16.6%) of 18 tumors contained numerous p53-positive cells, ranging from 10% to 50% of the tumor cell population. In 10 cases, exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis. Gel shifts consistent with mutations were identified in exon 8 of one tumor (10%) that exhibited abundant p53 immunostaining. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical studies using fixed, paraffin-embedded sections are very useful in the diagnosis of EMCTs. The most sensitive antibodies are anti-CD43, antilysozyme, and antimyeloperoxidase. Immunohistochemical methods are more sensitive than the Leder stain. We found p53 staining in a small subset of cases, in which we were able to confirm evidence of p53 gene mutation using the polymerase chain reaction and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis in one case; p53 gene mutations appear to be uncommon in EMCTs.","['Roth, M J', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, K', 'Kuchnio, M', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M']","['Roth MJ', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Elenitoba-Johnson K', 'Kuchnio M', 'Jaffe ES', 'Stetler-Stevenson M']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Tissue Fixation']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1995 Sep;119(9):790-8.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The mock transfected and transfected cells demonstrated no detectable H-2Kb molecules. B-78 transfected cells were subcutaneously (s.c.) and intravenously (i.v.) injected to B57BL/6 x C3H mice. Control B-78 cells formed tumors and lung metastases in injected animals. Cells transfected with IL-6, LIF and sIL-6R showed greatly reduced tumor and metastases formation. Transfection of IL-6, sIL-6R or LIF had similar protective effects while the combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R was most effective. In contrast, cells transfected with sLIFR showed reduced metastasis formation but increased tumor growth compared to mock transfected cells. Kinetic analysis demonstrated a 3 weeks lag period between the formation of tumors by B-78 cells and the combination of B-78 cells transfected with IL-6 and sIL-6R. No such lag phase was seen when B-78-IL-6 or B-78-sIL-6R cells were injected alone. Mice primarily injected s.c. with a mixture of IL-6 and sIL-6R transfected cells and rechallenged after 2 weeks with parental B-78 cells demonstrated long-lasting antitumor immunity. IL-6 and sIL-6 transfected cells used alone for immunization had only limited effect. Injection of transfected cells into SCID mice which are characterized by greatly reduced number of T and B cells, showed a protective effect of sIL-6R on metastasis formation by B-78 cells. beta 2m knockout mice lacking CD8+ T cells, injected with B-78 cells developed tumors and died after 2 weeks. However, B-78 cells transfected with IL-6 developed tumors in only 50% of animals. Mice without tumors rechallenged with B-78 cells demonstrated required immunity against parental melanoma cells. The results obtained indicate that studied IL-6-type cytokines and their respective soluble receptors affect murine melanoma growth and metastasis formation. The major finding of these studies is that IL-6 complexed with sIL-6R demonstrated qualitatively different biological activity than IL-6 alone especially in stimulating long lasting anti-melanoma immunity. The proposed mechanism of action of such complexes beside activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes is activation of NK cells.","['Mackiewicz, A', 'Wiznerowicz, M', 'Roeb, E', 'Nowak, J', 'Pawlowski, T', 'Baumann, H', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Rose-John, S']","['Mackiewicz A', 'Wiznerowicz M', 'Roeb E', 'Nowak J', 'Pawlowski T', 'Baumann H', 'Heinrich PC', 'Rose-John S']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, Great Poland Cancer Center, Poznan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Growth Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-6/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lymphokines/*administration & dosage', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', '*Receptors, Cytokine', '*Receptors, Interleukin', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/21 00:00,1995/07/21 00:01,['1995/07/21 00:00'],"['1995/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb32341.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1995 Jul 21;762:361-73; discussion 373-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb32341.x.,,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, LIF shows closest structural homology to granulocyte colony stimulating factor and growth hormone. Sequence alignments for the functionally related molecules oncostatin M and ciliary neurotrophic factor, when mapped to the LIF structure, indicate regions of conserved structural and surface character. Analysis of published mutagenesis data implicate two regions of receptor interaction which are located in the fourth helix and the preceding loop.

We studied 25 ATL, and 24 healthy HTLV-I carriers. Patients with acute ATL showed a variety of the expression of the HML-1 antigen (range 0.4-74.8%). HML-1 expression on mononuclear cells (MNCs) in blood from patients with chronic ATL ranged from 1.7-43.6% (mean 13.5%). This level of expression was less than that of patients with acute ATL, but not significantly. In patients with smoldering ATL, the degree of patients with acute ATL, but not significantly. In patients with smoldering ATL, the degree of expression ranged from 1.6-13.3% (mean 8.0%). In contrast to patients with acute ATL, MNCs from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and B-cell type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) did not express the HML-1 antigen, except for the 2 patients with ALL. Healthy HTLV-I carriers and healthy controls also were negative for HML-1 reactivity. In acute ATL, patients with gastrointestinal tract infiltration tended to have high expression of the HML-1 epitope. After stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), healthy HTLV-I carriers showed significantly increased expression of the HML-1 epitope (P < 0.05). Recently, the beta 7 integrin family has been found to play a specific role in mucosal localization or adhesion, and HML-1 protein was found to match the deduced beta 7 N-terminal sequence. We propose that the cellular gene responsible for HML-1 epitope expression may, like IL-2, IL-2R, etc., be transactivated by infection with HTLV-I, and HML-1 antigen gene expression by HTLV-I infection may lead to infiltration of ATL cells with highly expressed HML-1 epitope into the gut mucosa.","['Otsuka, M', 'Hanada, S', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Ishitsuka, K', 'Uozumi, K', 'Arima, T']","['Otsuka M', 'Hanada S', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Uozumi K', 'Arima T']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*biosynthesis', 'Intestines/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830500102 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 Sep;50(1):1-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830500102.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (integrin alphaEbeta7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A human leukemic cell line K562/A02 was established by stepwise increase of concentrations of doxorubicin (Dox) in medium. P-glycoprotein was detected by immunohistochemistry assay. The mdr1 gene expression was measured by RT-PCR. The amplification of mdr1 gene in its genome, and DNA topisomerase II (Top II) gene expression were determined by dot-blot hybridization. RESULTS: K562/A02 was highly cross-resistant to vincristine (VCR), homoharringtonin (HHT), amsacrine (m-AMSA), daunorubicin (Dau) and etoposide (VP-16), slightly to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), but not cisplatin (Cis), methotrexate (MTX) and fluorouracil (5-FU), showing a typical phenotype of MDR. Intracellular accumulation of Dau in K562/A02 was 33% as high as that in K562. P-glycoprotein P-170 was positive. In K562/A02, the mdr1 gene did not amplify, the mdr1 mRNA level was markedly higher, the Top II mRNA level was lower, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was higher than in K562. CONCLUSION: mdr1 mRNA was overexpression and thus the encoded P-170 was responsible for MDR in K562/A02 while Top II or GST may play a role in MDR.","['Yang, C Z', 'Luan, F J', 'Xiong, D S', 'Liu, B R', 'Xu, Y F', 'Gu, K S']","['Yang CZ', 'Luan FJ', 'Xiong DS', 'Liu BR', 'Xu YF', 'Gu KS']","['Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao,Zhongguo yao li xue bao = Acta pharmacologica Sinica,8100330,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao. 1995 Jul;16(4):333-7.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His platelets completely lacked collagen-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion, but showed normal responses to other agonists. All family members tested showed normal platelet aggregation with collagen. Analysis of 125I surface-labeled platelets by two-dimensional SDS gel electrophoresis disclosed absence of the spot corresponding to platelet membrane GPIa (alpha 2) but no other significant deficiencies of major platelet glycoproteins i.e., GPIb, IIb-IIIa, and IV. Immunoisolation studies of the patient's platelets indicated that neither anti-GPIa nor anti-GPIIa (beta 1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolated any surface membrane proteins corresponding to GPIa. GPVI, a putative collagen receptor, was immunoisolated from the platelets. Indirect immunofluorescence study using flow cytometry confirmed that the patient's platelets were totally deficient in surface expression of the GPIa-IIa complex (alpha 2 beta 1 integrin). In contrast, phytohemoagglutinin-activated T-lymphocytes from the patient expressed normal concentrations of this complex. The data suggest that our patient had an acquired deficiency of the platelet GPIa-IIa complex, due to a myeloproliferative disorder, which might account for the absence of responsiveness of his platelet to collagen.","['Handa, M', 'Watanabe, K', 'Kawai, Y', 'Kamata, T', 'Koyama, T', 'Nagai, H', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Handa M', 'Watanabe K', 'Kawai Y', 'Kamata T', 'Koyama T', 'Nagai H', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Blood Center, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Bleeding Time', 'Collagen/*pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*deficiency', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/complications', 'Platelet Adhesiveness/*drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Receptors, Collagen', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/etiology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 1995 Mar;73(3):521-8.,,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Collagen)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regular Ph' defect results in BCR-ABL gene chimaerism on the one hand and suppressed synthesis of the protein responsible for Zn absorption on the other. The resulting Zn deficiency leads, through its metalloenzymes, to a low NAP activity and depressed DNA & RNA polymerase activities: the latter necessitates an adaptive mechanism to sustain cell division despite low zinc. This adaptation is in the form of another gene alteration; a point mutation in the BCR-ABL chimaeric gene, now an oncogene, whose onco-proteins are zinc-independent and stimulate cell division more efficiently (though abnormally also) than the polymerases while defying the usual mechanisms regulating DNA synthesis and cell division. Thus it seems possible that assisted transcellular zinc transport could prevent development of CML in Ph'-positive individuals and the enhanced (abnormal) cellular proliferation might be specifically inhibited.","['Jibrin, I M']",['Jibrin IM'],"['Nitel Health Centre, Nitel Training School, Cappa, Oshodi, Lagos, Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogenes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc/deficiency/*metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306-9877(95)90185-X [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(95)90185-x [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1995 Apr;44(4):301-5. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(95)90185-x.,,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear whether NC contains the determinants for the specific recognition of the viral RNA or instead contributes nonspecific RNA contacts to strengthen a specific contact made elsewhere in the Gag polyprotein. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we have swapped the NC domains of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), generating an HIV-1 mutant containing the M-MuLV NC domain and an M-MuLV mutant containing the HIV-1 NC domain. These mutants, as well as several others, were characterized for their abilities to encapsidate HIV-1, M-MuLV, and nonviral RNAs and to preferentially package genomic viral RNAs over spliced viral RNAs. We found that the M-MuLV NC domain mediates the specific packaging of RNAs containing the M-MuLV psi packaging element, while the HIV-1 NC domain confers an ability to package the unspliced HIV-1 RNA over spliced HIV-1 RNAs. In addition, we found that the HIV-1 mutant containing the M-MuLV NC domain exhibited a 20-fold greater ability than wild-type HIV-1 to package a nonviral RNA. These results help confirm the notion that the NC domain specifically recognizes the retroviral genomic RNA during RNA encapsidation.","['Berkowitz, R D', 'Ohagen, A', 'Hoglund, S', 'Goff, S P']","['Berkowitz RD', 'Ohagen A', 'Hoglund S', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Microbiology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', '*Genes, Viral', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kidney', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection', 'Viral Core Proteins/*metabolism']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.10.6445-6456.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Oct;69(10):6445-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.10.6445-6456.1995.,['AI 24845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",,,['gag'],,PMC189545,,,,,,,,,,

Only one form has been previously characterized biochemically. We have now determined that the mature CA protein of avian sarcoma and leukemia viruses exists as three species with different C termini, ending in amino acid residues A-476, A-478, and M-479 of the Gag precursor, respectively. These structures were deduced from a combination of cyanogen bromide peptide mapping, sequence analysis of tryptic peptides, and electrospray mass spectrometry. The three forms of CA were detected in the same ratios in Rous sarcoma virus and avian myeloblastosis virus and therefore are likely to represent a common feature of members of this genus of avian retroviruses. The only previously reported CA species, CAM-479, accounts for only about 36% of the total CA protein, while CAA-476 and CAA-478 account for 55 and 9%, respectively. From the analysis of peptides cleaved in vitro by PR, the viral protease, we infer that the cleavage site between A-476 and A-477 not only is recognized by PR but is the preferred site. We were unable to determine if A-478/A-479 is a cleavage site for PR or alternatively if CAA-478 results from further processing of CAM-479 by a carboxypeptidase. To study the biological significance of residues A-477 to M-479, we constructed genetically altered viruses in which deletions removed either residues 477 to 479 or 477 to 488.

This 5' leader is 1,076 nucleotides in length and is formed of independent regions involved in key steps of the viral life cycle: (i) the Moloney murine leukemia virus 5' repeat, untranslated 5' region, and primer binding site sequences necessary for the first steps of proviral DNA synthesis, (ii) the virus-like 30S (VL30)-derived sequence containing a functional dimerization-packaging signal (E/DLS) directing viral RNA dimerization and packaging into MLV virions, and (iii) an Alu-like sequence preceding the 5' untranslated sequence of v-rasH which contains the initiation codon of the p21ras oncoprotein. These functional features, the unusual length of this leader (1,076 nucleotides), and the presence of stable secondary structures between the cap and the v-ras initiation codon might well cause a premature stop of the scanning ribosomes and thus inhibit v-ras translation. In order to understand how Harvey murine sarcoma virus achieves a high level of expression of the ras oncogene, we asked whether the rat VL30 sequence, 5' to v-ras, could contribute to an efficient synthesis of the ras oncoprotein. The implications of the VL30 sequence in the translation initiation of Ha-ras were investigated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and in murine cells. Results show that the rat VL30 sequence allows a cap-independent translation of a downstream reporter gene both in vitro and in murine cells.

Mutagenesis has demonstrated that sequences in each of the 21-bp repeats can be divided into three domains designated A, B, and C. Tax stimulates the binding of CREB to the B domain, which is essential for Tax activation of HTLV-1 gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that Tax will stimulate the binding of CREB to the HTLV-1 21-bp repeats but does not stimulate CREB binding to the consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE) element found in the somatostatin promoter. However, Tax stimulates CREB binding to a consensus CRE in the context of the 21-bp repeats, indicating the importance of these sequences in stimulating CREB binding. To determine the mechanism by which Tax stimulates CREB binding and determine potential interactions between Tax and CREB, we used the mammalian two-hybrid system in conjunction with in vitro binding and gel retardation assays. Two-hybrid analysis indicated that mutations in either the basic or leucine zipper region of CREB prevented interactions with Tax. Since several studies have demonstrated that Tax will also stimulate the binding of a variety of different basic region-leucine zipper proteins to their cognate binding sites, we assayed whether chimeric proteins composed of portions of CREB and another basic region-leucine zipper protein, Jun, could be used to map domains required for interactions with Tax. These studies were possible because we did not detect in vivo or in vitro interactions between Tax and Jun. The amino acid sequence of the CREB basic region and a portion of its leucine zipper were required for both in vivo and in vitro interactions with Tax and increased binding of CREB to the 21-bp repeats in response to Tax. These studies define the domains in CREB required for both in vivo and in vitro interactions by the HTLV-1 Tax protein.","['Yin, M J', 'Paulssen, E', 'Seeler, J', 'Gaynor, R B']","['Yin MJ', 'Paulssen E', 'Seeler J', 'Gaynor RB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-8594, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.10.6209-6218.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Oct;69(10):6209-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.10.6209-6218.1995.,,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,PMC189518,,,,,,,,,,

Results of previous studies of perinatal risk factors have been contradictory, perhaps because most studies either have been hospital based or have been restricted to limited geographical areas. PURPOSE: A nationwide case-control study was carried out to identify maternal and perinatal risk factors for this disease. METHODS: The case-control study was nested in cohorts defined by all live births in Sweden recorded in the nationwide Medical Birth Register. Since 1973, this register has routinely collected information on all hospital births in regard to maternal demographic data, reproductive history, pregnancy, delivery, and the neonatal period. From the Swedish National Cancer Register, 613 case subjects were identified in successive birth cohorts from 1973 through 1989. Five control subjects per case subject were randomly selected from the pool of children matched by sex and month and year of birth. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for potential risk factors and to estimate their effects after adjustment for possible confounders. RESULTS: Risk of childhood lymphatic leukemia at all ages increased with Down's syndrome (OR = 20.0; 95% CI = 4.2-94.2), maternal renal disease (OR = 4.4; 95% CI = 1.6-12.1), use of supplementary oxygen (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.5-3.6), postpartum asphyxia (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2-2.6), birth weight of more than 4500 g (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1-2.7), and hypertensive disease during pregnancy (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0-1.9). Down's syndrome affected risk mostly in children younger than 5 years, whereas other factors affected those children 5 years old or older. Being one of a multiple birth also increased risk among older children (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.0-6.0). Use of supplementary oxygen may act as a causal intermediate (surrogate) for postpartum asphyxia and its causes, as would high birth weight for its causes. CONCLUSIONS: Several maternal and perinatal risk factors were found to be associated with childhood lymphatic leukemia, but they showed age-specific differences. Overall, only a few risk factors were identified, and these accounted for a small proportion of cases. We concluded that most risk factors for childhood lymphatic leukemia remain unidentified in very young children.","['Cnattingius, S', 'Zack, M M', 'Ekbom, A', 'Gunnarskog, J', 'Kreuger, A', 'Linet, M', 'Adami, H O']","['Cnattingius S', 'Zack MM', 'Ekbom A', 'Gunnarskog J', 'Kreuger A', 'Linet M', 'Adami HO']","['Department of Social Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden']",1995/06/21 00:00,1995/06/21 00:01,['1995/06/21 00:00'],"['1995/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/87.12.908 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Jun 21;87(12):908-14. doi: 10.1093/jnci/87.12.908.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological mechanism responsible for this nucleotide bias is currently unknown. The increased A-content of these viral genomes corresponds to the typical use of synonymous codons by all members of the lentiviral family (HIV, SIV, BIV, FIV, CAEV, EIAV, visna) and the human spuma retrovirus, but not by other retroviruses like the human T-cell leukemia viruses HTLV-1 and HTLV-II. In this article, we analyzed A-bias for all codon groups in all open reading frames of several lentiviruses. The extent of lentiviral codon bias could be related to host cellular translation. By calculating codon bias indices (CBIs), we were able to demonstrate an inverse correlation between the extent of codon bias and the rate of translation of individual reading frames in these viruses. Specifically, the shift toward A-rich codons is more pronounced in pol than in gag lentiviral genes. Since it is known that Gag synthesis exceeds Pol synthesis by a factor of 20 due to infrequent ribosomal frame-shifting during translation of the gap-pol mRNA molecule, we propose that the aminoacyl-tRNA availability in the host cell restricts the lentiviral preference for A-rich codons. In addition, less A-nucleotides were found in regions of the viral genome encoding multiple functions; e.g., overlapping reading frames (tat-rev-env) or in genes that overlap regulatory sequences (nef-LTR region).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['van Hemert, F J', 'Berkhout, B']","['van Hemert FJ', 'Berkhout B']","['Department of Anatomy and Embryology, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Evol,Journal of molecular evolution,0360051,IM,"['Adenine', 'Base Composition/*genetics', 'Codon/*genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'HIV-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Transfer/physiology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00170664 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Evol. 1995 Aug;41(2):132-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00170664.,,"['0 (Codon)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the technique of intracellular delivery of antibodies provides a new approach to discern the role of PKC isoforms in multidrug resistance in various tumor cells.","['Gollapudi, S', 'Soni, V', 'Thadepalli, H', 'Gupta, S']","['Gollapudi S', 'Soni V', 'Thadepalli H', 'Gupta S']","['Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, University of California, Irvine 92717, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,IM,"['Animals', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Isoenzymes/physiology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/joc.1995.7.2.157 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chemother. 1995 Apr;7(2):157-9. doi: 10.1179/joc.1995.7.2.157.,,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to analyze the experience with IMC and unusual complications in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergoing IFN alpha treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The occurrence of IMC and unusual complications was evaluated in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML. RESULTS: Well-documented and clinically evident complications developed in 35 patients after a median of 14 months of IFN alpha treatment. These included 28 (5%) of 581 patients with Ph-positive CML treated with IFN alpha-containing regimens at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and seven patients referred for opinion or problems who were on other studies. Hypothyroidism occurred in 11 patients (2%), immune-mediated hemolysis in seven (1%), and connective tissue diseases in 11 (2%). Other unusual occurrences included congestive heart failure (CHF; n = 4), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT; n = 3), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN; n = 1), and vitiligo (n = 1). IFN treatment was discontinued in 19 patients and the dose was reduced in five. Ten of 11 patients (91%) with immune-mediated hypothyroidism and eight of 11 (73%) with connective tissue diseases had some degree of cytogenetic response at the time of the event. CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of IMC is low, patients treated with IFN alpha should be monitored for signs and symptoms of autoimmunity.","['Sacchi, S', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Cohen, P R', 'Pierce, S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Sacchi S', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cohen PR', 'Pierce S', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology/immunology', 'Connective Tissue Diseases/etiology/immunology', 'Female', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/etiology/immunology', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.9.2401 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Sep;13(9):2401-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.9.2401.,,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examined the molecular mechanism underlying the delta 12-PGJ2-induced HO-1 synthesis. delta 12-PGJ2 markedly stimulated the promoter activity of the 5'-flanking region of the rat HO-1 gene from -810 to +101 in rat basophilic leukemia cells. From functional analysis of various deletion mutant genes we found that the delta 12-PGJ2-responsive element was localized in a region from -690 to -660, containing an E-box motif, which was essential for the delta 12-PGJ2-stimulated promoter activity. When the region containing the delta 12-PGJ2-responsive element was combined with a heterologous promoter, SV40 promoter, in the sense and antisense direction, the element showed an enhancer activity in response to delta 12-PGJ2. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that delta 12-PGJ2 specifically stimulated the binding of two nuclear proteins to the E-box motif of this region. These results indicate that delta 12-PGJ2 induces the expression of the rat HO-1 gene through nuclear protein binding to a specific element having an E-box motif.","['Koizumi, T', 'Odani, N', 'Okuyama, T', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Negishi, M']","['Koizumi T', 'Odani N', 'Okuyama T', 'Ichikawa A', 'Negishi M']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.37.21779 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)90244-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Sep 15;270(37):21779-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.37.21779.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), 5-LO moves from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope (NE) to interact with FLAP. However, 5-LO has recently been found within the nucleus, as well as the cytosol, of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs). To assess whether nuclear 5-LO can contribute to LT synthesis in these cells, we investigated whether this enzyme pool 1) translocates upon cell activation, 2) colocalizes with FLAP, and 3) is enzymatically active. By cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting, both cytosolic and nuclear soluble 5-LO decreased dramatically in RBL cells following activation with the calcium ionophore A23187. Concurrently, 5-LO increased in the pelletable nuclear pool, where FLAP was also detected. The loss of both cytosolic and nuclear soluble 5-LO, with concomitant increase exclusively at the NE, as well as co-localization with FLAP, were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent and confocal microscopy. In AMs, the nuclear soluble pool of 5-LO moved to the NE, where FLAP was also found; however, the cytosolic 5-LO pool did not translocate. Application of these methods to PMNs confirmed that cytosolic 5-LO moved to the nuclear envelope and co-localized with FLAP. By cell-free assay, nuclear soluble proteins from both RBL cells and AMs, but not PMNs, were able to generate 5-LO products from arachidonate, and this was inhibited by the direct 5-LO inhibitor zileuton. Cytosolic proteins from all cell types also showed cell-free 5-LO activity. These results demonstrate three distinct patterns of 5-LO translocation that are specific for each cell type: translocation of only a cytosolic pool in PMNs, of only a nuclear pool in AMs, and of both cytosolic and nuclear pools in RBL cells. By virtue of its enzymatic activity and ability to translocate, nuclear 5-LO has the potential to contribute to LT synthesis in RBL cells and AMs. Finally, these results provide a foundation for considering the individual functions of discrete pools of 5-LO in future studies.","['Brock, T G', 'McNish, R W', 'Peters-Golden, M']","['Brock TG', 'McNish RW', 'Peters-Golden M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of MIchigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0652, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*enzymology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.37.21652 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)90224-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Sep 15;270(37):21652-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.37.21652.,"['P50 HL46487/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL47391/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Leukotrienes)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nramp is part of a small family of at least two genes, Nramp1 and Nramp2. Primer extension and cDNA cloning were used to isolate the complete 5' end of the Nramp1 mRNA. Analysis of genomic cosmid and bacteriophage clones overlapping the complete Nramp1 gene revealed that the gene was composed of 15 exons and spanned 11.5 kb of genomic DNA. Positioning of introns on the coding portion of the mRNA revealed a modular relationship between coding exons and predicted structural domains of the protein, with 8 of the 12 transmembrane (TM) domains encoded by individual exons. Northern blotting analysis indicated that Nramp1 expression was restricted to J774A.1 and RAW 264.7 macrophage lines and was dramatically increased by treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping experiments were used to locate the transcription initiation site of Nramp1 and revealed the presence of one major and several minor initiation sites. Nucleotide sequencing of the corresponding region failed to detect classical TATA and CAAT elements, but identified two putative initiator sequences located near the major initiation site.

Because these two chromosomes are translocated with breakpoints within the BCR and ABL genes in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias, knowledge of these sequences also might provide insight into the validity of various theories of chromosomal rearrangements. Comparison of these genes with their cDNA sequences reveal the positions of 23 BCR exons and putative alternative BCR first and second exons, as well as the common ABL exons 2-11, respectively. Additionally, these regions include the alternative ABL first exons 1b and 1a, a new gene 5' to the first ABL exon, and an open reading frame with homology to an EST within the BCR fourth intron. Further analysis reveals an Alu homology of 38.83 and 39.35% for the BCR and ABL genes, respectively, with other repeat elements present to a lesser extent. Four new Philadelphia chromosome translocation breakpoints from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients also were sequenced, and the positions of these and several other previously sequenced breakpoints now have been mapped precisely, although no consistent breakpoint features immediately were apparent. Comparative analysis of genomic sequences encompassing the murine homologues to the human ABL exons 1b and 1a, as well as regions encompassing the ABL exons 2 and 3, reveals that although there is a high degree of homology in their corresponding exons and promoter regions, these two vertebrate species show a striking lack of homology outside these regions.","['Chissoe, S L', 'Bodenteich, A', 'Wang, Y F', 'Wang, Y P', 'Burian, D', 'Clifton, S W', 'Crabtree, J', 'Freeman, A', 'Iyer, K', 'Jian, L']","['Chissoe SL', 'Bodenteich A', 'Wang YF', 'Wang YP', 'Burian D', 'Clifton SW', 'Crabtree J', 'Freeman A', 'Iyer K', 'Jian L', 'et al.']","['University of Oklahoma, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Norman 73019, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Genes', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice/genetics', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888754385710087 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1995.1008 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1995 May 1;27(1):67-82. doi: 10.1006/geno.1995.1008.,"['CA47456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'H00313/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,"['GENBANK/U07000', 'GENBANK/U07561', 'GENBANK/U07562', 'GENBANK/U07563']","['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients with diffuse CD30 positive lymphomas (groups 1, 2) frequently presented with extranodal tumours (68.8%) and lymph node enlargement greater than 2 cm in diameter (50%), and rarely with leukaemic changes, bone marrow involvement and hypercalcaemia (one case of each). Patients in group 3 rarely had extranodal tumours, but had frequent leukaemic changes. Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1; CD54) by the lymphoma cells in 13 patients (81.3%) with diffuse CD30 positive lymphomas, was significantly higher than that in 33 patients (9.1%) with CD30 negative adult T-cell leukaemia/ lymphomas. No positive reaction for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) was found in the lymphoma cells of CD30 positive cases. The overall survival in patients with diffuse CD30 positive lymphomas was better than that of CD30 negative adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma patients, but showed no significant difference. These findings suggest that diffuse CD30 positive adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma has unusual clinical and immunohistological findings.

The percentage of Lip-associated DNA was 47%, and 72% of the Lip DNA was protected from DNase I digestion. The Lip-encapsulated (Len) DNA was injected intravenously into Balb/c mice, and at various times post-injection, various tissues were examined for the presence of the exogenous DNA. Plasmid DNA was detected by Southern blot analysis mainly in the liver and spleen, but small amounts were also detected in the lungs, heart and kidneys. The plasmid DNA was retained in mouse liver cells for at least 7 days post-injection, and remained in an episomal state. The levels of human FIX protein in the mouse plasma were 190-650 pg per ml for 2 to 7 days post-injection. Treatment of mice with chloroquine (Cq) and colchicine (Cc) prior to Lip injection significantly increased the amount of plasmid DNA found in the liver cells, as well as the level of human FIX in the plasma. These results demonstrate the potential use of Len DNA for gene transfer into liver and spleen, and for gene therapy of inherited and acquired disorders.","['Baru, M', 'Axelrod, J H', 'Nur, I']","['Baru M', 'Axelrod JH', 'Nur I']","['Octa Medical Research Institute, Kiryat Weizmann, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Animals', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'DNA/*administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Factor IX/*biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hemophilia B/blood/genetics/therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Liposomes', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Plasmids/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",1995/08/19 00:00,1995/08/19 00:01,['1995/08/19 00:00'],"['1995/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['037811199500281A [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(95)00281-a [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1995 Aug 19;161(2):143-50. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00281-a.,,"['0 (Liposomes)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",,,['FIX'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the passive and traumatic process leading to necrosis, an active program characterized by organelle integrity and called apoptosis has been described. A positive correlation between the apoptotic cell death process and oxidative imbalance has been demonstrated. In fact, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) seems to be capable of impairing the apoptotic program, replenishing intracellular reduced glutathione content in cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) as apoptotic inducer. Moreover, protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide (CHX) can facilitate apoptotic triggering by TNF, and mitochondrial function was suggested to be essential in the TNF-mediated apoptotic process. With this in mind, a specific analysis using the JC-1 probe, a fluorescent dye which is capable of indicating mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) changes, was carried out. Our results show that TNF exposure is capable of altering the mitochondria and that NAC protection from CHX + TNF-induced apoptosis could be due to a direct effect of the drug on mitochondrial integrity and function.","['Cossarizza, A', 'Franceschi, C', 'Monti, D', 'Salvioli, S', 'Bellesia, E', 'Rivabene, R', 'Biondo, L', 'Rainaldi, G', 'Tinari, A', 'Malorni, W']","['Cossarizza A', 'Franceschi C', 'Monti D', 'Salvioli S', 'Bellesia E', 'Rivabene R', 'Biondo L', 'Rainaldi G', 'Tinari A', 'Malorni W']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Carbocyanines', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)71311-0 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1995.1311 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1995 Sep;220(1):232-40. doi: 10.1006/excr.1995.1311.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', ""21527-78-6 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine)"", '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Exp Cell Res 1996 Jan 10;222(1):251-3']

The Ki67 antigen is constitutionally expressed in almost all untreated exponentially proliferating Molt-4 cells. Treatment with 10 nM TPA prolonged the duration of the cell cycle time and resulted in a progression arrest of cells in G1- and G2-phases, during which Ki67 expression was decreased to an undetectable level. However, in TPA-treated cultures, the Ki67-positive fraction was invariably smaller than the growth fraction as estimated from continuous 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling curves. This discrepancy could be explained by the finding that some Ki67-negative G1 cells do not enter the resting state but instead remain in the cycling compartment. These results show that Ki67 expression of tumor cells with relatively long G1 duration is downregulated to undetectable levels in late G1-phase and the difference in the level of Ki67 expression between late G1 cells and resting G1 cells is undetectable by conventional immunological methods. Although TPA induced differentiation of Molt-4 cells into mature suppressor T cells, the phenotypic modification was not correlated with cell cycle position and Ki67 reactivity of the cells. These results suggest that growth arrest and phenotypic differentiation of Molt-4 cells are independent effects of TPA.","['Tsurusawa, M', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Tsurusawa M', 'Fujimoto T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990200207 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Jun 1;20(2):146-53. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990200207.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GST isoenzymes may represent biochemical markers of neoplastic transformation, and, possibly, drug resistance is associated with altered GST-isoenzyme levels. The ability to measure GST-isoenzymes in cell populations would be useful for several biological and clinical applications. We have developed an immunofluorescence flow cytometric method for the simultaneous detection of different GST-isoenzymes and of DNA in fixed cells. Due to the impossibility of working under saturating conditions for the anti-GST antibody, a normalizing procedure was developed to permit quantitative analysis of single cells labelled with the anti-GST antibody at high dilution. A theoretical model and experimental data supported the use of this procedure. The method proposed is general and could be applied to other antibodies in order to obtain quantitative data outside saturating conditions. The method was challenged in different applications in order to compare it with other classical techniques. First, we characterized sublines resistant to different anticancer drugs with respect to variations of GST isotypes. In a second application, we studied the intercellular heterogeneity of GST content in mouse renal cells.

We have particularly investigated RBL-2H3 cells, which at the mRNA level predominantly expressed InsP3R-IV [De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys JB. et al. (1994) Determination of relative amounts of inositol trisphosphate receptor mRNA isoforms by ratio polymerase chain reaction. J. Biol. Chem., 269, 21691-21698]. When measured in identical experimental conditions, microsomes from RBL-2H3 cells were characterized by a much higher InsP3 binding affinity (Kd 3.8 +/- 0.8 nM, Bmax 0.40 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg protein) than microsomes from A7r5 cells (Kd 65 +/- 7 nM, Bmax 0.65 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg protein) or from cerebellum (Kd 135 +/- 14 nM, Bmax 7.35 +/- 1.13 pmol/mg protein). An affinity-purified antibody against the C-terminus of type II-like InsP3Rs detected, after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, a 250 kD protein in RBL-2H3 and C3H10T1/2 cells, but not in other cell types. An isoform-specific antibody against the C-terminus of InsP3R-I was used to determine the presence of the various InsP3R-I splice isoforms at the protein level. The 273 kD (brain), 261 kD (peripheral tissues) and 256 kD (Xenopus oocytes) isoforms were recognized. Expression of InsP3R-I in RBL-2H3 cells was very low. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that InsP3R isoforms may differ to a large extent in their affinity for InsP3 and suggest that RBL-2H3 cells are a useful model for the study of InsP3R-IV.","['Parys, J B', 'de Smedt, H', 'Missiaen, L', 'Bootman, M D', 'Sienaert, I', 'Casteels, R']","['Parys JB', 'de Smedt H', 'Missiaen L', 'Bootman MD', 'Sienaert I', 'Casteels R']","['Laboratorium voor Fysiologie, KU Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/analysis/classification/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Microsomes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/analysis/classification/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0143-4160(95)90070-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0143-4160(95)90070-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 1995 Apr;17(4):239-49. doi: 10.1016/0143-4160(95)90070-5.,,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The G1 cyclin gene CcnD3, which encodes cyclin D3, is inhibited by dexamethasone in P1798 murine T lymphoma cells. Glucocorticoids also inhibit expression of the catalytic partner of cyclin D3, Cdk4. Inhibition of these two genes results in a decrease in the ability to phosphorylate the Rb-1 tumor suppressor gene product. Stable transformation with SV40 T antigen expression vectors prevents glucocorticoid-mediated cell cycle arrest, which is consistent with the conclusion that glucocorticoids inhibit Rb-1 phosphorylation. Overexpression of cyclin D3 suffices to restore Rb-kinase activity in glucocorticoid-treated cells. Nevertheless, overexpression of cyclin D3 does not prevent glucocorticoid inhibition of cell proliferation. Cells transformed with Cdk4 expression vectors, with or without cyclin D3 expression vectors, also undergo G0 arrest in the presence of dexamethasone. Glucocorticoids inhibit c-Myc expression in lymphoid cells, and transient expression of c-Myc protein attenuates the lytic response in glucocorticoid-treated human leukemia cells (R. Thulasi, D. V. Harbour, and E. B. Thompson, J. Biol. Chem., 268: 18306-16312, 1993). However, P1798 cells stably transfected with c-Myc expression vectors are sensitive to glucocorticoid-mediated G0 arrest. Such transformants withdraw from the cell cycle when treated with dexamethasone. P1798 cells were transformed so as to express both c-Myc protein and cyclin D3 in the presence of glucocorticoids. These Myc/D3 cells continue to proliferate in the presence of dexamethasone, and virtually all of these cells are capable of entering S phase in the presence of the steroid. Rapid apoptotic cell death occurs when wild-type P1798 cells are treated with dexamethasone in serum-free medium. Myc-transformed and cyclin D3-transformed cells also die rapidly when treated with glucocorticoids in the absence of serum. T antigen transformants are resistant to glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis in serum-free medium. Double transformants that express both cyclin D3 and c-Myc are also resistant to apoptosis in the presence of dexamethasone. We conclude that inhibition of both CcnD3 and c-Myc genes is critical to glucocorticoid-mediated G0 arrest. Furthermore, those genes that convey resistance to growth arrest also convey resistance to cell death.","['Rhee, K', 'Bresnahan, W', 'Hirai, A', 'Hirai, M', 'Thompson, E A']","['Rhee K', 'Bresnahan W', 'Hirai A', 'Hirai M', 'Thompson EA']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550-0645, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Sep 15;55(18):4188-95.,['R37-CA24347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,['c-Myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A mosaicism of a cytogenetically normal clone and a clone with trisomy 8 was detected in both patients throughout the course of the disease, a finding confirmed by FISH on BM cells. The relative size of the trisomic clone increased from 52% to 71% (p < 0.0001) and from 53% to 69% (p = 0.001) of all BM cells at the time of the leukemic switch in patients 1 and 2, respectively. Combined FISH and immunophenotyping of BM cells showed involvement of the granulomonocytic lineage in patient 1 and involvement of erythroid cells as well as of the granulomonocytic lineage in patient 2. Only disomic lymphocytes were detected in both patients. FISH on single hemopoietic colonies grown in semisolid media detected trisomic CFU-GM and disomic BFU-E in patient 1, whereas a proportion of CFU-GM and BFU-E deriving from the trisomic clone was detected in patient 2. However, the percent of trisomic colonies was lower than the percent of involved granulomonocyte precursors and involved erythroblasts, as detected by combined FISH and immunophenotyping on fresh BM samples. We have thus shown heterogeneity of lineage involvement by trisomy 8 in MDS undergoing transformation into AML. Although preferential growth of disomic clones may occur in vitro, the finding of an increased size of the trisomic clone at the time of leukemic switch suggests that these cells had proliferative advantage in vivo over cells without trisomy 8.","['Fagioli, F', 'Cuneo, A', 'Bardi, A', 'Carli, M G', 'Bigoni, R', 'Balsamo, R', 'Previati, R', 'Pazzi, I', 'Roberti, G', 'Rigolin, G M']","['Fagioli F', 'Cuneo A', 'Bardi A', 'Carli MG', 'Bigoni R', 'Balsamo R', 'Previati R', 'Pazzi I', 'Roberti G', 'Rigolin GM', 'et al.']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA/*analysis', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165460894002284 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(94)00228-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1995 Jul 15;82(2):116-22. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(94)00228-4.,,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Data from five nuclear sites in the United States were included in a cohort analysis that as well as controlling for all the usual factors also allowed for possible effects of three cancer modulating factors (exposure age, cancer latency, and year of exposure). This analysis was first applied to three distinct cohorts, and then to two sets of pooled data. RESULTS: From each study cohort there was evidence of a risk of cancer related to dose, and evidence that the extra radiogenic cancers had the same overall histological manifestations as naturally occurring cancers and were largely the result of exposures after 50 years of age causing deaths after 70 years. There were, however, significant differences between the five sets of risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risks of cancer in nuclear workers were appreciably higher than estimates based on the cancer experiences of survivors of the atomic bomb, some uncertainties remained as there were non-uniform standards of dosimetry in the nuclear sites. The differences between nuclear workers and survivors of the atomic bomb were largely the result of relations between age at exposure and risk of cancer being totally different for workers and survivors and, in the occupational data, there were no signs of the special risks of leukaemia found in atomic bomb data and other studies of effects of high doses.","['Kneale, G W', 'Stewart, A M']","['Kneale GW', 'Stewart AM']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Energy', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.52.8.515 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1995 Aug;52(8):515-23. doi: 10.1136/oem.52.8.515.,,,,,,,PMC1128286,"['Occup Environ Med. 1996 Jul;53(7):502-3.

Although rare, pycnodysostosis has attained prominence because the French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was retrospectively diagnosed as having been affected with this disorder. For rare autosomal recessive traits, homozygosity mapping provides a powerful approach to disease gene mapping. We have now used this approach to map the locus for pycnodysostosis. Following a genome-wide search in a large Arab family with 16 affected relatives, we established linkage to a narrow region on chromosome 1q21, with a maximal lod score of 11.72. A single marker, D1S498, was homozygous-by-descent in all affecteds and defined the gene locus to a region of 4 cM.

Exciting recent progress has been made in the characterization of the viral genotypic features involved in FeLV-associated diseases. Molecular studies have clearly defined the causal role of variant FeLV env gene determinants in two disorders: the T-lymphocyte cytopathicity and the clinical acute immunosuppression induced by the FeLV-FAIDS variant and the pure red cell aplasia induced by FeLV-C/Sarma. Variant or enFeLV env sequences also appear to play a role in FeLV-associated lymphomas. Additional studies are required to determine the host cell processes that are perturbed by these variant env gene products. In the case of the FeLV-FAIDS variant, the aberrant env gene products appear to impair superinfection interference, resulting in accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA and cell death. In other cases it is likely that the viral env proteins interact with host products that are important in cell viability and/or proliferation. Understanding of these mechanisms will therefore provide insights to factors involved in normal lymphohaematopoiesis. Similarly, studies of FeLV-induced haematological neoplasms should reveal recombination or rearrangement events involving as yet unidentified host gene sequences that encode products involved in normal cell growth regulation. These sequences may include novel protoncogenes or sequences homologous to genes implicated in human haematological malignancies. The haematological consequences of FIV are quite similar to those associated with HIV. As with HIV, FIV does not appear to directly infect myeloid or erythroid precursors, and the mechanisms of marrow suppression likely involve virus, viral antigen, and/or infected accessory cells in the marrow microenvironment. Studies using in vitro experimental models are required to define the effects of each of these microenvironmental elements on haematopoietic progenitors. As little is known about the molecular mechanisms of FIV pathogenesis, additional studies of disease-inducing FIV strains are needed to identify the genotypic features that correlate with virulent phenotypic features. Finally, experimental FIV infection in cats provides the opportunity to correlate in vivo virological and haematological changes with in vitro observations in a large animal model that closely mimics HIV infection in man.","['Linenberger, M L', 'Abkowitz, J L']","['Linenberger ML', 'Abkowitz JL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/virology', 'Cats/virology', '*Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/transmission', 'Genes, Viral', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/classification/genetics/immunology/*physiology', '*Leukemia, Feline/immunology/transmission', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/veterinary/virology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/veterinary/virology', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/veterinary/virology', 'Retroviridae/classification', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Spumavirus/pathogenicity']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80233-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1995 Mar;8(1):73-112. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80233-1.,"['DK41934/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02396/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",251,,"['env', 'gag', 'pol', 'rev', 'tat']",,PMC7135792,,,,,,,,,,

As summarized in Figure 3, the primary effect of SFFV, which occurs within days, is to cause a polyclonal proliferation of erythroid precursor cells that can proliferate in the absence of their normal regulator erythropoietin. This is the direct result of the unique envelope glycoprotein encoded by SFFV, which is transported to the cell surface and apparently interacts with the EpoR or another component of the multimeric EpoR complex, resulting in the constitutive activation of the Epo signal transduction pathway. Within this proliferating population of erythroid cells is a rare cell that has undergone several genetic changes due to the integration of the viral genome in specific sites in the mouse DNA. This leads to the activation of a gene encoding the PU.1 transcription factor, whose high expression in erythroid cells may be the cause of the block in differentiation that is characteristic of SFFV-transformed erythroid cells. SFFV integration can also lead to the inactivation of the p53 tumour supressor gene, giving these cells a growth advantage in the mouse. The disease induced by SFFV in mice is very similar to polycythaemia vera in humans (Golde et al, 1981). The major clinical feature of polycythaemia vera is the continuous expansion of the number of mature red blood cells in the presence of low serum Epo levels. Also, BFU-E and CFU-E from these patients can form in the absence of Epo like the analogous cells from SFFV-infected mice (Casadevall et al, 1982). It is possible that haematopoietic cells from individuals suffering from this disease express a protein similar to the envelope glycoprotein of SFFV that can interact with the EpoR and lead to its constitutive activation. Alternatively, these patients may contain a mutant EpoR gene that is constitutively activated like the mutant EpoR described earlier. As we understand more fully how the SFFV envelope protein constitutively activates te EpoR complex, we can begin to design therapies to counteract its action that can then be applied to treating patients with polycythaemia vera or other human diseases associated with uncontrolled erythropoiesis.","['Ruscetti, S K']",['Ruscetti SK'],"['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology/virology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, env', 'Genome, Viral', 'Helper Viruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Virus Replication']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80239-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1995 Mar;8(1):225-47. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80239-2.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '0 (v-Spi-1 protein, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",125,,"['EpoR', 'Fv-2', 'Fv-2<up>rr</up>', 'PU.1', 'Sfpi-1', 'env', 'gag', 'p53', 'pol']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the pleiotropic effects of HTLV-I in the host represents a real challenge. Immunological regulation likely plays a central role in HTLV-I induced neurological disease, uveitis, and perhaps arthritis, implicating the importance of host factors as well. Viral proteins, including tax and p12' might play a role in T-cell proliferation, but the event(s) that result in the late leukaemic phase are unknown. The lack of effective therapy against HTLV-I-induced leukaemia renders prevention of viral infection the best means to eliminate HTLV-I associated diseases. Elimination or reduction of breast feeding from seropositive mothers in Japan has already produced encouraging results. In developing countries, probably only a vaccine will prevent the spread of HTLV-I infection. The molecular epidemiology of HTLV and STLV will help understand not only the phylogeny of these viruses but also the migration of human populations in the past. Episodes of horizontal transmission in the past and probably the present, indicates that nonhuman primates are the natural reservoir of HTLVs.

Transduction of CD18 into hematopoietic cells from children with LAD represents a potential therapy for this disorder. In an attempt to maximize transfer and expression of CD18, we evaluated retroviral vectors with and without the neomycin selectable marker, with a modified tRNA primer binding site designed to prevent inhibition of gene expression, and with two different viral envelope proteins produced by using the amphotropic retrovirus packaging cell line PA317 or the gibbon ape leukemia virus packaging cell line PG13. The vectors were tested using transducing K562/CD11b cells and LAD Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) B cells and measuring levels of cell-surface CD11/CD18 expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The best results were obtained with vectors made using PG13 packaging cells, for which about 25% of the K562 cells exposed once to the vectors expressed surface CD11b/CD18 and about 25% of the LAD EBV B cells exposed three times over a 3-day period to the vectors expressed surface CD11a/CD18. In contrast, transduction of cells under similar conditions with retroviral vectors produced using PA317 producer cells yielded less than 2% of the K562 cells and less than 4% of the LAD EBV B cells expressing the CD11/CD18 heterodimer on the cell surface. The presence or absence of the neomycin resistance gene or the modified tRNA primer had no effect on CD18 gene transfer rate or expression level. The increase in transduction with PG13 vectors correlated with Northern blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies that indicated that both K562 cells and the LAD EBV B cells express transcripts for the gibbon ape leukemia virus receptor at higher levels than for the amphotropic virus receptor. These findings indicate that the transduction efficiency of retroviral packaging cell lines correlates with receptor gene expression in the target cells and that vectors made using PG13 cells may be efficacious for gene therapy for LAD and other diseases in which gene transfer to hematopoietic cells is required.","['Bauer, T R Jr', 'Miller, A D', 'Hickstein, D D']","['Bauer TR Jr', 'Miller AD', 'Hickstein DD']","['Medical Research Service, Seattle VA Medical Center, WA 98108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'CD18 Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Child', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukocyte-Adhesion Deficiency Syndrome/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/genetics/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology']",1995/09/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77529-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 15;86(6):2379-87.,"['DK08940/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",,,['neo'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell lines established from CML patients in blast crisis show higher expression of this aberrant bcr-abl transcript than cells from patients in chronic phase of the disease. This observation provided the stimulus to investigate whether increased expression of the aberrant bcr-abl fusion transcript is critical to the progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis. We have monitored the bcr-abl mRNA expression in 25 patients by serial quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses during a follow-up period of 12 to 156 months after diagnosis, with a median observation time of 28 months. In all patients who have shown disease progression to accelerated phase (n = 4) or blast crisis (n = 7), an increase in bcr-abl mRNA expression was detected up to 16 months before laboratory or clinical parameters showed phenotypic transformation of the malignant clone. To investigate whether the elevated levels of bcr-abl mRNA reflected an increase in the proportion of leukemic cells in the samples analyzed or primarily enhanced transcriptional activity of the bcr-abl fusion gene, we performed quantitative analyses of the bcr-abl gene at the DNA level and of the Ph chromosome at the cytogenetic level and compared these data with steady-state bcr-abl mRNA levels. We show that increased levels of the bcr-abl transcript did not reflect increased proportions of leukemic cells but elevated steady-state levels of the chimeric mRNA in the malignant cells before disease progression. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that an increase of the chimeric mRNA expression in the leukemic cells precedes the phenotypic transformation of the malignant clone.","['Gaiger, A', 'Henn, T', 'Horth, E', 'Geissler, K', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Maier-Dobersberger, T', 'Greinix, H', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Haas, O A', 'Lechner, K', 'Lion, T']","['Gaiger A', 'Henn T', 'Horth E', 'Geissler K', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Maier-Dobersberger T', 'Greinix H', 'Mannhalter C', 'Haas OA', 'Lechner K', 'Lion T']","[""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77528-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 15;86(6):2371-8.,,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also involved in T-acute and -chronic leukemias arising in cases of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), an immunodeficiency syndrome. Similar chromosomal rearrangements occur also in the clonally expanded T cells in AT patients before the appearance of the overt leukemia. We have analyzed the expression of TCL1 mRNA and protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from four AT cases and from healthy controls. We found that the TCL1 gene was overexpressed in the PBLs of an AT patient with a large clonal T-cell population exhibiting the t(14;14) translocation but not in the lymphocytes of the other cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of the TCL1 genomic locus to lymphocyte metaphases from the AT patient with the T-cell clonal expansion showed that the breakpoint of the t(14;14) translocation lies within the TCL1 locus and is accompanied by an inverted duplication of the distal part of chromosome 14. These data indicate that TCL1 is activated in preleukemic clonal cells as a consequence of chromosome translocation involving sequences from the TCR locus at 14q11. Deregulation of TCL1 is the first event in the initiation of malignancy in these types of leukemias and represents a potential tool for clinical evaluation.","['Narducci, M G', 'Virgilio, L', 'Isobe, M', 'Stoppacciaro, A', 'Elli, R', 'Fiorilli, M', 'Carbonari, M', 'Antonelli, A', 'Chessa, L', 'Croce, C M', 'Russo, G']","['Narducci MG', 'Virgilio L', 'Isobe M', 'Stoppacciaro A', 'Elli R', 'Fiorilli M', 'Carbonari M', 'Antonelli A', 'Chessa L', 'Croce CM', 'Russo G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Raggio-Italgene, Pomezia, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', 'Preleukemia/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77526-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 15;86(6):2358-64.,['CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['TCL1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the tumorigenicity of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected cell lines in an in vivo cell proliferation model using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Eleven HTLV-I-infected cell lines were injected into SCID mice and we found that 4 of them were capable of proliferating in SCID mice. Three of four transplantable cell lines are derived from the leukemic cell clone and 6 of 6 HTLV-I-infected cell lines of nonleukemic cell origin could not engraft in SCID mice. Interestingly, it was shown that some HTLV-I-infected and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent cell lines could successfully engraft in SCID mice. The expression of IL-2 mRNA was not detected in these cell lines growing either in vivo or in vitro. HTLV-I viral products were not detected in 3 of 4 transplantable cell lines proliferating in vivo. Peripheral blood T cells immortalized by introduction of tax gene of HTLV-I were found to have no tumorigenic potential in SCID mice. These data suggest that (1) HTLV-I-infected cell lines of nonleukemic cell origin do not have enough leukemogenic changes to acquire the tumorigenic potential in SCID mice; (2) the IL-2 autocrine mechanism is not directly involved in the tumor cell growth; (3) viral gene expression is not needed for the maintenance of neoplastic cell growth; and (4) the expression of tax gene is not sufficient for the neoplastic cell growth in vivo.","['Imada, K', 'Takaori-Kondo, A', 'Akagi, T', 'Shimotohno, K', 'Sugamura, K', 'Hattori, T', 'Yamabe, H', 'Okuma, M', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Imada K', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Akagi T', 'Shimotohno K', 'Sugamura K', 'Hattori T', 'Yamabe H', 'Okuma M', 'Uchiyama T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line/transplantation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, pX', 'Graft Survival', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*etiology/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/transplantation', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/complications/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77525-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 15;86(6):2350-7.,,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,['tax'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term exposure (24 hours) of bone marrow cultures to colcemid (0.1 microgram/mL) maximized a high frequency of metaphase collection. Such preparations were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a 5 Mb probe that overlapped the region of the translocation at chromosome 9q34. This detected the Ph translocation in the resultant large number of overly contracted chromosome spreads. The procedure was validated and verified by studying 70 double-blind marrow samples from patients in different stages of Ph+ CML and from patients with Ph- hematologic malignancies (controls). This hypermetaphase FISH (HMF) method clearly identified Ph+ metaphases and allowed the analysis of 500 hypermetaphases per sample in less than 1 hour after FISH. HMF (1) identified statistically significant differences between the frequencies of Ph+ cells in samples that differed by less than 4%; (2) resolved such differences among patient samples that were all judged 100% Ph+ by standard G-band cytogenetics (CG); (3) resulted in the reclassification of response status in 23% of the patients initially classified by CG; (4) recognized Ph+ cells in 16% of patients characterized as having a complete cytogenetic response and in one patient with an original diagnosis of Ph- CML; and in one patient with an original diagnosis of Ph- CML; and (5) was informative where insufficient metaphases were obtainable for analysis by CG. HMF appears to be uniquely suitable for monitoring the status of patients with CML receiving treatment. It should also be applicable for patients with any hematologic diseases where chromosomal alterations are known and appropriate FISH probes are available.","['Seong, D C', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Ro, J Y', 'Talpaz, M', 'Xu, J', 'Robinson, J R', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Champlin, R E', 'Siciliano, M J']","['Seong DC', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Ro JY', 'Talpaz M', 'Xu J', 'Robinson JR', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Champlin RE', 'Siciliano MJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Azure Stains', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy', '*Metaphase/drug effects', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77524-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 15;86(6):2343-9.,"['CA34936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Azure Stains)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL cells and HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines also make cluster formation rapidly after the non-stimulative culture. However, the mechanism of the acute proliferation of ATL cells remains to be understood. We report the following novel features of homotypic adhesion via leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)/intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) pathway that suggest a role for it in cytokine production and rapid proliferation of ATL cells: (1) ATL cells show clustering in a calcium dependent manner, even at the higher concentration; (2) ATL cells consistently and highly express ICAM-1 and an active form of LFA-1, whereas integrin expression, except for LFA-1, is rather lower compared with that of normal CD4+ T cells; (3) ATL cells make conjugate formation within 6 minutes and clustering within 48 hours, both of which are inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against LFA-1 and ICAM-1; (4) spontaneous mRNA transcription and protein secretion of both interleukin-1 and parathyroid hormone-related protein are observed consistently in ATL cells, and these productions are inhibited by anti-LFA-1 and anti-ICAM-1 MoAbs but are markedly increased by cross-linking of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 by the immobilized specific MoAbs; and (5) proliferative responses of ATL cells are also inhibited by these MoAbs. We propose that ATL cells proliferate in sequential events: the homotypic and calcium-dependent adhesion through LFA-1/ICAM-1, the signal transduction through these adhesion molecules, the production of cytokines, and the proliferation.","['Wake, A', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Nakatsuka, K', 'Misago, M', 'Oda, S', 'Morimoto, I', 'Eto, S']","['Wake A', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakatsuka K', 'Misago M', 'Oda S', 'Morimoto I', 'Eto S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Medicine, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Bone Resorption/blood/etiology', 'Calcium/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/etiology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77516-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 15;86(6):2257-67.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of a human myelogenous leukemia cell line, ML-1a, with TNF in the presence of cycloheximide triggers endonucleolytic activity and apoptotic cell death within 90 minutes. The general serine protease inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and the chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitor N-tosyl-L-lysyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) completely abrogated TNF-induced DNA fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies. However, 13 other protease inhibitors, including serine protease inhibitors, did not. The addition of TPCK to cells 30 minutes after TNF treatment completely inhibited the cytokine action, indicating that TPCK-sensitive proteases are not involved in the early stages of signal transduction. TNF is cytotoxic and induces differentiation in ML-1a cells after a 3-day incubation. TPCK had no effect on the TNF-induced cytotoxicity and differentiation, indicating that TPCK-sensitive proteases are specific for DNA fragmentation. TPCK also blocked TNF-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The dose-response and the time-course of the inhibitor, however, indicated that the site of action of TPCK for NF-kappa B activation and for DNA fragmentation are quite distinct. Therefore, we conclude that TNF activates two distinct TPCK-sensitive pathways, one leading to apoptosis and the other to NF-kappa B activation.","['Higuchi, M', 'Singh, S', 'Chan, H', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Higuchi M', 'Singh S', 'Chan H', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77515-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 15;86(6):2248-56.,,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis was conducted to investigate these questions and to assess the value of a risk-oriented CNS prophylaxis approach. We analyzed the incidence of CNS leukemia after initiation of therapy in patients treated on 4 consecutive trials for adult ALL including different CNS prophylactic modalities. The treatment groups included (1) the program preceeding the vincristine-Adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD) regimen, with no CNS prophylaxis; (2) the VAD regimen with prophylaxis using high-dose systemic chemotherapy; (3) the modified VAD program with high-dose systemic chemotherapy to all patients and IT chemotherapy for high-risk patients after achieving complete remission; and (4) the hyperCVAD program with early high-dose systemic and IT chemotherapy starting during induction to all patients, with more IT injections (16IT) administered to the high-risk group for CNS relapse compared with the low-risk group (4IT). A total of 391 patients were included, 73 of whom were treated with preVAD, 112 with VAD, 114 with modified VAD, and 92 with hyperCVAD. The overall CNS relapse rates were 31%, 18%, 17%, and 3%, respectively for the 4 groups (P < .001). For the high-risk group for CNS relapse, they were 42%, 26%, 20%, and 2%, respectively (P < .001). The differences in CNS relapse rates in the low-risk group were not statistically significant. At 3 years, the overall CNS leukemia event-free rates were 48%, 76%, and 98%, respectively (P < .001).

A series of adult, childhood, and infant leukemias with either simple or complex versions of the t(10;11) has been examined by Southern analysis and shown to involve rearrangement to the HRX locus. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from either bone marrow or peripheral blood cells showed that HRX sequence was fused to AF10 sequence in all 8 cases and subsequent sequence analysis showed an in-frame fusion between the HRX and AF10 sequence. A consistent feature of these fusions was the juxtaposition of the leucine dimerization motif of AF10 onto the NH2-terminal region of HRX.

No correlation between the toxicity and reduction rate of nitrocompounds by rat liver DT-diaphorase (EC 1.6.99.2) was observed. The toxicity is not significantly affected by dicumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase. Nitrocompounds examined were poor substrates for DT-diaphorase, being 10(4) times less active than menadione. Their poor reactivity is most probably determined by their preferential binding to a NADPH binding site, but not to menadione binding site of diaphorase. These data indicate that at comparable activities of DT-diaphorase and single-electron-transferring NAD(P)H dehydrogenases in the cell, the toxicity of nitrocompounds will be determined mainly by their single-electron reduction reactions.","['Cenas, N', 'Nemeikaite, A', 'Dickancaite, E', 'Anusevicius, Z', 'Nivinskas, H', 'Bironaite, D']","['Cenas N', 'Nemeikaite A', 'Dickancaite E', 'Anusevicius Z', 'Nivinskas H', 'Bironaite D']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Mokslininku.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'NADPH Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Sheep', 'Vitamin K/antagonists & inhibitors']",1995/08/31 00:00,1995/08/31 00:01,['1995/08/31 00:00'],"['1995/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(95)00064-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(95)00064-y [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Aug 31;1268(2):159-64. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(95)00064-y.,,"['0 (Nitro Compounds)', '0 (Quinones)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.99.1 (NADPH Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the aetiology is unclear, it is most probably multifactorial, and may be related to treatment such as radiation and cyclosporin A. The clinical findings are reported of two patients who developed such a retinopathy and the ocular histology from one of these cases is presented. METHODS: Two patients underwent BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, receiving campath-1G for prophylaxis against graft versus host disease, and showed fundal changes compatible with BMT retinopathy. The eyes from one patient were retrieved at post mortem and examined by both light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: The visual symptoms and fundal signs resolved spontaneously with no specific treatment in one patient. Light and electron microscopic examination of the eyes of the other patient was compatible with an ischaemic aetiology and showed evidence of retinal capillary endothelial loss. CONCLUSIONS: (i) Histopathology in one case of BMT retinopathy demonstrates a retinal endotheliopathy similar to that described in radiation retinopathy. (ii) BMT retinopathy may occur in the absence of cyclosporin A treatment. (iii) The retinopathy can recover spontaneously with no specific treatment.","['Webster, A R', 'Anderson, J R', 'Richards, E M', 'Moore, A T']","['Webster AR', 'Anderson JR', 'Richards EM', 'Moore AT']","[""Ophthalmology Department, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Capillaries/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Fundus Oculi', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Infarction/etiology', 'Ischemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retinal Diseases/*etiology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bjo.79.7.687 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 1995 Jul;79(7):687-91. doi: 10.1136/bjo.79.7.687.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,PMC505200,,,,,,,,,,

The French Study Group on Cutaneous Lymphomas.,1009-15,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Cutaneous pleomorphic small T-cell lymphoma is a rare, recently recognized lymphoma, different from mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. Only a few cases have been reported and no treatment modalities have been defined. We reviewed the clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, molecular biologic, and follow-up data of 11 primary cutaneous pleomorphic small T-cell lymphomas. RESULTS: The lesions presented as red purplish nodules, tumors, or plaques. The infiltrate consisted of small pleomorphic lymphoid cells without epidermotropism in nine patients and with a propensity to infiltrate the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Most cases were CD4+/CD8-. A T-cell clone was detected in the skin lesions of nine patients tested. The mean follow-up was 70.1 months and the median follow-up was 20 months. Ten patients are alive with three having persistent lesions. Interferon alfa-2a induced partial or complete remissions in five patients. Interferon alfa-2a combined with a regimen containing doxorubicin chlorhydrate induced a complete remission in a patient suffering a relapse after cyclophosphamide and interferon alone. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous pleomorphic small T-cell lymphoma is a well-defined type of low-grade cutaneous lymphoma with favorable prognosis. Interferon and/or chemotherapy are the treatment of choice in patients with large tumor burden.","['Friedmann, D', 'Wechsler, J', 'Delfau, M H', 'Esteve, E', 'Farcet, J P', 'de Muret, A', 'Parneix-Spake, A', 'Vaillant, L', 'Revuz, J', 'Bagot, M']","['Friedmann D', 'Wechsler J', 'Delfau MH', 'Esteve E', 'Farcet JP', 'de Muret A', 'Parneix-Spake A', 'Vaillant L', 'Revuz J', 'Bagot M']","['Department of Dermatology, Henri-Mondor Hospital, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Skin Neoplasms/pathology/therapy']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archderm.131.9.1009 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1995 Sep;131(9):1009-15. doi: 10.1001/archderm.131.9.1009.,,,,,,,,"['Arch Dermatol. 1995 Sep;131(9):1077-80.

The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative method to measure alkaline phosphatase activities in individual leukocytes by image analysis. We studied the reaction rate of L-ALP in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes by a microscope attached to a TV camera and a computerized image analyzer. The optical density (OD) measured was standardized by grey filters with known absorbance. We measured IOD for individual cells after a set incubation time by end-point measurements. Studies of kinetic parameters of L-ALP were performed by single-point measurements in the linear phase of the reaction and at increasing substrate concentrations. Cellular IOD increased proportionally with incubation time up to 10 min. The mean KM(mM) and Vmax(delta IOD/min) values were 0.70 +/- 0.11 and 1.76 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE, n = 5) respectively. Our findings are comparable to previous results using a polyvynil alcohol method in microphotometry analysis.

Among H-2 genes, the Dd gene is the most closely associated with resistance to LP-BM5 MuLV infection. However, the Dd-mediated resistance is highly influenced by outside H-2 genes, i.e. A lineage strains are more resistant than mice strains of B6/B10 lineage. In this study, the mice having BALB background were analysed and, similarly to A lineage mice, only Dd gene products were found to be required to provide resistance to LP-BM5 MuLV infection. Furthermore, BALB/c Kh mice bearing both Dd and Ld genes clearly showed obviously higher resistance than BALB/c-H-2dm2 mice solely having the Dd gene. In addition, in the long-term observation of the effect of the Dd gene on B6/B10 background mice, D8 mice having the Dd gene as a transgene and expressing a high level Dd gene product showed higher resistance than naturally recombinant B10.A(18R) mice.

A high proportion of patients (79.5%) showed chromosomal abnormalities. Most of them had a pseudodiploid karyotype (46 chromosomes), characterized mainly by a translocation. In relation to chromosome number, 27% of them were hyperdiploid with more than 50; 9% hyperdiploid between 47-50 and 7% hypodiploid (less than 46). Among structural aberrations found, were the following recurrent translocations: t (1; 19), t (4; 11), t (9; 22) in 6.8%, 9.1% and 2.3% of cases respectively, all related to an early B immunophenotype.

Treatment involves the administration of chemotherapy by protocol. Response to the chemotherapy is generally poor. Infants with Down syndrome may have a transient manifestation of leukemia known as a leukemic disorder; this will resolve without chemotherapy. Other neonatal disorders can also mimic congenital leukemia; the infant must be evaluated for these, in addition to the definitive diagnosis made via bone marrow aspiration and examination.

In the absence of specific cytogenetic and/or molecular abnormalities, the study of X chromosome inactivation pattern in female patients represents a useful indirect approach for determination of the clonal or polyclonal nature of a cell population of unknown origin or the persistence of clonal hemopoiesis in leukemia after treatment. An intriguing observation was the documentation of an apparent clonal hematopoiesis in a quite high proportion of AML patients during morphological remission. These data were interpreted as evidence of a multi-step origin of AML, in which a first 'hit' was responsible for the growth advantage of a cytogenetically silent and morphologically normal preleukemic clone, whereas a second 'hit' would give rise to the overt leukemic phenotype. More recent surveys on the frequency of clonal remission, however, arrived at discordant results and could detect the occurrence of true clonal remission in a much lower percentage of cases than previously reported. These apparent discrepancies, which in part may be explained by differences in the series studied and in the approach used to detect clonality, for the moment leave open the fascinating issue of the single or multistep origin in many human leukemias.","['Lo Coco, F', 'Saglio, G']","['Lo Coco F', 'Saglio G']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia Umana, Universita La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1586-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a non-radioactive androgen receptor (AR) assay which allows a simple and quantitative evaluation of the clonality of hematopoietic cells and progenitors. In this approach 5' AR primer is labelled by fluorescein and the amplified product is run on a sequencing gel which allows evaluation of the intensity of the fluorescent peaks generated. A computer software then analyzes the reduction of the intensity of the peaks on HpaII-digested samples. In order to determine the feasibility of the technique, we analyzed the clonality of leukemic cells from a patient with an acute-phase CMML which showed a typical clonal pattern of her leukemic DNA sample (WBC = 300 x 10(9)/I) using phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) analysis. The same sample was then analyzed with either radioactive- or fluorescein-labelled AR primers, showing a typical clonal pattern (complete disappearance of one allele after HpaII digestion). A short-term clonogenic assay was then set up on methylcellulose and clonogenic progenitors were individually analyzed. All 24 colonies tested showed a typical clonal pattern with the disappearance of the same allele on each sample after HpaII digestion, indicating that they all derived from the same leukemic stem cell. Using this approach we then analyzed 94 patients with several hematologic malignancies and quantification of their fluorescent peaks. Fifty-four percent of the patients were clearly heterozygous (ie, a difference of > or = 2 CAG repeats was present between the two copies of the gene) and could be analyzed in an automatic sequencer using the fluorescent primers. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from all patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed a clonal or oligoclonal pattern at diagnosis whereas a polyclonal pattern was seen when remission was obtained. Similarly, out of 21 patients with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a clonal pattern was demonstrated in 10 whereas an oligoclonal or non-clonal pattern was shown in 11. These results show that this non-radioactive and safe technology can now be used on a large scale to evaluate the clonality of highly purified hematopoietic stem cells and their progenitors in hematopoietic malignancies and this might allow new insights into the targets of clonal amplification.","['Delabesse, E', 'Aral, S', 'Kamoun, P', 'Varet, B', 'Turhan, A G']","['Delabesse E', 'Aral S', 'Kamoun P', 'Varet B', 'Turhan AG']","['CNRS URA 1461, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic Markers', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/analysis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Androgen/*analysis/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1578-82.,,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the effect of Eilatin and Norsegoline, two new aromatic alkaloids derived from the Red Sea purple tunicate Eudistoma sp., on in vitro proliferation and differentiation of leukemic cell lines and blast cells of three AML patients. These biological properties were studied in two complementary culture methods. The first is a clonogenic assay that supports colony formation in agar and reflects terminal divisions. The second is a suspension assay where clonogenic cells increase exponentially and reflects self-renewal. Eilatin and Norsegoline, at micromolar concentrations, suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, both primary colony formation in agar and the recovery of clonogenic cells from suspension culture in the investigated cell lines and in fresh blasts. Furthermore, both alkaloids were more effective in inhibiting clonogenic cells grown in suspension than primary colonies grown in agar. In addition, these agents were able to induce immunophenotypic maturation of leukemic cell lines (upregulation of CD14 and CD11 and down-regulation of CD34 antigens). Our results indicate that Eilatin and Norsegoline significantly inhibit self-renewal capacity of leukemic progenitors and may provide a useful new tool for the treatment of AML patients.","['Lishner, M', 'Shur, I', 'Bleiberg, I', 'Rudi, A', 'Kashman, Y', 'Fabian, I']","['Lishner M', 'Shur I', 'Bleiberg I', 'Rudi A', 'Kashman Y', 'Fabian I']","['Hematology Unit, Meir Hospital, Kfar Saba, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urochordata/*chemistry']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1543-8.,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression patterns of non-lineage specific markers (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD34, and HLA-DR), B-lineage markers (CD10, CD19, CD20, and CD22), T-lineage markers (CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8), and cross-lineage myeloid markers (CD14, CD15, and CD33) were compared at diagnosis and relapse. In case of low blast counts (< or = 70%) at relapse, double labeling for membrane markers and TdT was used in order to define the precise immunophenotype of the TdT+ leukemic cells. An immunological marker-shift was defined as either a conversion from positive to negative and vice versa or a difference in positivity of > or = 50%. Morphological differences between diagnosis and relapse were detected in 34% of precursor B-ALL and 14% of T-ALL. Differences in immunological marker expression were found in 72% of precursor B-ALL and in 75% of T-ALL, and generally concerned minor shifts with loss or acquisition of a few markers. The morphological shifts and immunophenotypic shifts were not correlated. Immunophenotypic shifts were found for all markers tested in precursor B-ALL, except for HLA-DR. Shifts in CD10 expression (16% of cases) were only observed in relapses occurring 30 months or more after diagnosis. In four precursor B-ALL an intra-lineage shift was found at relapse (one common ALL to null ALL and three pre-B-ALL to common ALL or null ALL) and two precursor B-ALL cases were diagnosed as acute non-lymphocytic leukemia at relapse based on morphology and immunophenotype. In T-ALL, neither intra-lineage nor inter-lineage shifts were observed, although shifts were detected in all T cell markers tested, except for the lineage specific CD3 and T cell receptor (TcR) markers. In conclusion, immunophenotypic shifts at relapse frequently occur in precursor B-ALL and T-ALL, in a small percentage leading to an intra-lineage shift (10%) or inter-lineage shift (5%). Therefore immunophenotypic monitoring of minimal residual disease in ALL patients should be based on multiple marker combinations, preferably together with polymerase chain reaction analysis of rearranged immunoglobulin and/or TcR genes or chromosome aberrations.","['van Wering, E R', 'Beishuizen, A', 'Roeffen, E T', 'van der Linden-Schrever, B E', 'Verhoeven, M A', 'Hahlen, K', 'Hooijkaas, H', 'van Dongen, J J']","['van Wering ER', 'Beishuizen A', 'Roeffen ET', 'van der Linden-Schrever BE', 'Verhoeven MA', 'Hahlen K', 'Hooijkaas H', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1523-33.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To extend previous data, we examined the genetic instability of a human genomic region, termed S3/1, which we isolated from a human DNA library. The S3/1 sequence contains a stretch with exceptionally high numbers of (GA)n and (CA)n dinucleotide repeats. An interesting rearranged pattern emerged from Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from three patients with different hematopoietic proliferative diseases out of 69 analyzed (one case of essential thrombocytosis (ET), one of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and one of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)). The CML and ET patients showed a deletion of 300 to 400 base pairs (bp), and the AML an insertion of about 600 bp, involving the S3/1 locus. Amplification of the rearranged fragments confirmed these observations, and enabled a precise analysis of the region involved. In normal individuals, no gross rearrangements involving this region could be detected. Analysis of DNA from three consecutive bone marrow biopsies of the CML patient disclosed that the genetic alteration affecting S3/1 was no longer detectable following alpha 2-interferon therapy, neither by Southern blot nor by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thus confirming the tumor-specificity of the alteration; in the same patient, moreover, two out of five other analyzed microsatellites showed tumor-specific alleles, suggesting a more generalized genetic instability in the leukemic cells. These results demonstrate genetic instability of a region containing high numbers of short dinucleotide repeats in a small percentage (4%) of human hematopoietic proliferative disorders.","['Indraccolo, S', 'Simon, M', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Erfle, V', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Leib-Moesch, C']","['Indraccolo S', 'Simon M', 'Hehlmann R', 'Erfle V', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Leib-Moesch C']","['Institute of Molecular Virology, GSF-Forschungszentrum, Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1517-22.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fresh cells from two early B-lineage, t(9;22)-positive, ALL cases that were CD13/APN-negative at diagnosis, high levels of CD13/APN expression were induced after 3 days of in vitro culture. Similarly, continuously growing cell lines established from these ALLs, KOPN-30bi and KOPN-57bi, expressed CD13/APN, but retained other phenotypic, cytochemical and molecular features of early B-lineage cells. After 7 days of culture on human bone marrow stromal layers or murine S17 stromal cells, levels of CD13/APN expression by the leukemic cell lines decreased by more than 4-fold. After 21 days of culture on stromal cells, CD13/APN became undetectable by flow cytometry; however, the original levels of expression were regained when the cell lines were cultured without stroma. A more moderate decrease in CD13/APN expression was also observed in the myeloid lines KG-1 and HL-60 during culture on stroma. Suppression of CD13/APN expression required contact with stroma, but did not depend on VLA-4-mediated adhesion. Surprisingly, the mechanism through which stromal cells down-regulated CD13/APN expression in leukemic cells involved suppression of transcription from the CD13/APN gene. Contact with stroma resulted in a 2-3-fold decrease in CD13/APN mRNA expression and near ablation of CD13/APN gene transcription in nuclear run-on assays. Thus, CD13/APN expression by leukemic cells is regulated by interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment. CD13/APN expression in some ALL at diagnosis could result from a block in the signal transduction pathways that cause its suppression by bone marrow stromal cells.","['Saito, M', 'Kumagai, M', 'Okazaki, T', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Shapiro, L H', 'Look, A T', 'Campana, D']","['Saito M', 'Kumagai M', 'Okazaki T', 'Nakazawa S', 'Shapiro LH', 'Look AT', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD13 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1508-16.,"['P30-CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA 58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in murine myeloid cells.,1499-507,"Experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism through which p210 BCR-ABL, by its downstream signals, regulates c-myc messenger RNA expression in hematopoietic cells. We studied a model system in which stable expression of p210 BCR-ABL in interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent murine myeloid cell lines led to growth factor independent transformation. Active c-myc transcription was observed in p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells by nuclear run-on assay, and in heterologous reporter assays performed with the 5' regulatory region of murine c-myc linked to firefly luciferase. Transcription initiation occurred primarily from the P2 promoter in p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells. Cis and trans elements responsible for transcription initiation from the c-myc P2 promoter were studied. Expression of E2F1 protein in p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells accounted, in part, for binding to the E2F site of the P2 c-myc promoter. The functional importance of E2F1 expression in p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells toward c-myc transcription was established in reporter assays performed with the P2 c-myc promoter containing either wild-type or mutant E2F sites. Mutation of the E2F motif of P2 5' c-myc reduced activity of the promoter by 50%. By gel mobility shift, E2F1 was found in P2 c-myc band shift complexes along with the cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Therefore, coupling of E2F to components of the retinoblastoma-cyclin pathway defines a route from p210 BCR-ABL to c-myc transcription, which is required for p210 BCR-ABL transformation.","['Stewart, M J', 'Litz-Jackson, S', 'Burgess, G S', 'Williamson, E A', 'Leibowitz, D S', 'Boswell, H S']","['Stewart MJ', 'Litz-Jackson S', 'Burgess GS', 'Williamson EA', 'Leibowitz DS', 'Boswell HS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', '*Carrier Proteins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1499-507.,,"['0 (Arid4a protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanism of its effectiveness upon APL remains unclear, the PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) chimeric protein produced by t(15;17) is assumed to underlie the sensitivity of APL cells to ATRA. There are two major isoforms of PML-RARA transcripts; short (S) and long (L), according to the breakpoints in the PML gene. We therefore compared the clinical variables, the response to ATRA and the prognosis between 28 patients with type S and 68 patients with type L. Patients were treated in multi-institutional trials with ATRA, and chemotherapy was combined when peripheral blasts and leukocyte counts increased during the therapy. The clinical features at diagnosis were similar between the two molecular subtypes, and there was no significant difference in remission induction rates; 86% for the type S group and 90% for the type L group. There was no statistical difference in overall survival and CR duration as well as disease-free survival (DFS). In newly diagnosed patients, predicted 2-year DFS was 66% for the type S group and 67% for the type L group. In refractory or relapsed patients, it was 19 and 23%, respectively. These data indicated that isoforms of PML-RARA fused transcripts affect neither the clinical features of APL nor the prognosis after treatment with ATRA.","['Fukutani, H', 'Naoe, T', 'Ohno, R', 'Yoshida, H', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Shimazaki, C', 'Miyake, T', 'Nakayama, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Goto, S']","['Fukutani H', 'Naoe T', 'Ohno R', 'Yoshida H', 'Miyawaki S', 'Shimazaki C', 'Miyake T', 'Nakayama Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Goto S', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University Branch Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1478-82.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequently suggested cause for this side-effect is an ATRA-induced proliferation of APL cells. However, no definite explanation for such a proliferative effect has been clearly established. Another mechanism directly related to the differentiation of marrow leukemic cells could be a change in their microrheology, allowing their release from the bone marrow and their transfer toward peripheral blood (PB) and tissues. Using a single cell aspiration assay into a glass restrictive channel, we measured APL cell viscosity values in five de novo APL patients. A deformability index (DI) was defined as the ratio of mean normal neutrophil viscosity x 100/mean APL cell viscosity. Results were the following: (1) at diagnosis, two patients had high marrow DI (96 and 250%) and three patients had low marrow DI (16, 17, and 40%); (2) when PB and marrow APL cells were simultaneously tested, PB APL cells display higher DI than marrow APL-cells; (3) the two patients with high initial marrow DI experienced an ATRA-induced hyperleukocytosis after only 1 day of treatment; (4) in the three patients with low initial marrow DI, the DI was increasing during ATRA therapy and hyperleukocytosis seemed to occur when a large amount of maturing APL cells reached a viscosity value similar to that of mature neutrophils. These results suggest that an asynchronism between rheological and morphological maturation in each APL cell might explain the occurrence of hyperleukocytosis in some patients during ATRA differentiation therapy.","['Dombret, H', 'Geiger, S', 'Daniel, M T', 'Glaisner, S', 'Miclea, J M', 'Castaigne, S', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Lacombe, C', 'Chomienne, C', 'Degos, L']","['Dombret H', 'Geiger S', 'Daniel MT', 'Glaisner S', 'Miclea JM', 'Castaigne S', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Lacombe C', 'Chomienne C', 'Degos L']","['Service Clinique des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Viscosity', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocytosis/blood/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Rheology', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects', 'Viscosity']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1473-7.,,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of PML/RAR alpha on cell survival by expressing the fusion protein in the growth factor-dependent TF-1 cell line and analyzing the kinetics of cell death after GM-CSF deprivation. Results showed that PML/RAR alpha expression markedly delayed apoptotic cell death (3 weeks vs 1 week) without inducing growth factor independence. Growth factor deprivation caused rapid and massive apoptosis of control TF-1 cells (>95% apoptotic cells after 4-5 days). Factor-deprived control cells were synchronously and irreversibly committed to apoptosis as shown by their inability to re-enter the cell cycle after GM-CSF re-addition. The percentage of apoptotic cells in the PML/RAR alpha expressing cells was low (approximately 30-35%) and constant over the 4 weeks of factor deprivation. GM-CSF re-addition produced rapid increase in cell number at all time points during the 4 weeks of factor deprivation, suggesting that commitment to apoptosis was asynchronous and delayed in PML/RAR alpha-expressing TF-1 cells. We conclude that PML/RAR alpha interferes with the genetic pathways which regulate survival by reducing the frequency of commitment to apoptosis. This biological effect of PML/RAR alpha may contribute to its leukemogenetic potential.","['Rogaia, D', 'Grignani, F', 'Grignani, F', 'Nicoletti, I', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Rogaia D', 'Grignani F', 'Grignani F', 'Nicoletti I', 'Pelicci PG']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia University, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle', '*Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1467-72.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chimeric PML/RAR-alpha fusion transcripts can be demonstrated in all cases of APL, by a specific reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Previous studies found a correlation between expression of CD2 and involvement of the PML bcr3. In this study, we assessed this association in 43 children and adults with APL. A blind morphologic review of all smears was performed by four experienced hemopathologists who agreed the diagnosis of M3 vs M3v APL. CD2 expression on APL was detected by using different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against specific CD2 epitopes by flow cytometry and in selected cases by Northern blot by the use of a specific CD2 cDNA probe. Nineteen of 43 cases displayed the typical microgranular features consistent with the diagnosis of M3v. Of these, 12 had the bcr3 breakpoint on chromosome 15, while seven had the bcr1 type. In 16 of the 19 patients, leukemic cells expressed both CD2 protein and the corresponding mRNA. Similarly, in the negative cases, Northern blot analysis failed to demonstrate the presence of specific mRNA. The remaining 24 patients, with the classic morphologic features of M3, were CD3 negative. These results point out that CD2 expression correlates with the FAB M3v and not with the PML breakpoints. During the course of all-trans retinoic treatment a down-modulation of CD2 expression was observed in three M3v cases. Overall, our findings might suggest a role of CD2 epitopes in the regulation of adhesion properties of APL blast cells.","['Biondi, A', 'Luciano, A', 'Bassan, R', 'Mininni, D', 'Specchia, G', 'Lanzi, E', 'Castagna, S', 'Cantu-Rajnoldi, A', 'Liso, V', 'Masera, G']","['Biondi A', 'Luciano A', 'Bassan R', 'Mininni D', 'Specchia G', 'Lanzi E', 'Castagna S', 'Cantu-Rajnoldi A', 'Liso V', 'Masera G', 'et al.']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza (MI), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'CD2 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1461-6.,,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,['PML'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of recombinant-interleukin (r-IL)-2 and alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) on drug-induced cell death were evaluated. r-IL-2 significantly increased in vitro resistance to CLB, while purine analog cytotoxicity was slightly reduced by the cytokine. The potential in vivo significance of r-IL-2, acting as a survival signal on CLB-induced cell death, is supported by the correlation between the lowest IL-2 serum levels, the highest in vitro sensitivity to CLB and a major clinical response after CLB treatment in six out of eight CLL patients. Using 25 samples, alpha-IFN enabled CLL cells to increase resistance to CLB, CDA and FAMP in 14, eight and seven samples, respectively; conversely, alpha-IFN showed a synergism with both CLB and FAMP in six samples and with CDA in four. These results correlate with immunoenzymatic assay data showing that alpha-IFN either up- or down-regulates tumor necrosis factor and IL-1 levels in supernatants of some CLL samples. Apparently, alpha-IFN plays a dual role in regulating drug-induced cell death, while IL-2 seems to solely favor cell survival in CLL.","['Morabito, F', 'Callea, I', 'Rodino, A', 'Messina, G', 'Callea, V', 'Iacopino, P', 'Nobile, F', 'Brugiatelli, M']","['Morabito F', 'Callea I', 'Rodino A', 'Messina G', 'Callea V', 'Iacopino P', 'Nobile F', 'Brugiatelli M']","['Centro Trapianti di Midollo Osseo A Neri, Dipartimento di Ematologia, Reggio Calabria, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/analysis', 'Interleukin-2/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*pathology/therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Sep;9(9):1450-5.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall incidence of infections per treatment course (14%) was significantly lower than that observed on the 5-day or weekly regimens (P < 0.001). The incidence of minor, atypical and viral infections were similar. There was no difference in survival in the various trials. In conclusion, a 3-day schedule of fludarabine in previously treated CLL patients was associated with a lower infection rate and similar survival to a 5-day schedule.

Three cytomorphological groups were discerned. The first two groups consisted of five patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (group I) and three patients with acute myeloid leukemia (group II). These leukemias resembled those of non-Down individuals. The third and largest group (group III) consisted of 20 cases of acute myeloid leukemia that showed prominent megakaryocytic and/or erythroid differentiation and occurred in children under 6 years of age. The blasts in this group were non-reactive for myeloperoxidase or non-specific esterase and expressed CD7, CD34 and CD36 with variable expression of CD61, CD13 and CD33. Four patients in this group had an acquired trisomy 8. Four group III leukemias underwent a durable, spontaneous remission within 2 months of diagnosis. There were no morphologic differences between those leukemias in this group that progressed and those that remitted; however, all remissions occurred in newborns.

ICAM-1 was detected on B-CLL cells from 19 out of 62 patients (30.6%) and its expression did not correlate with the majority of immunological markers. An important finding of this study was the association between ICAM-1 expression and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Slg (r = 0.507; P < 0.001). As far as correlation with clinical parameters is concerned, a statistically significant association between Binet clinical stages and ICAM-1 expression was found (P < 0.05). Furthermore, an atypical CLL morphology was more frequently encountered among patients who expressed ICAM-1 (P < 0.005). To obtain more information on the role of ICAM-1 in CLL we measured serum levels with a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. In 47 B-cell CLL patients studied, the mean value of circulating ICAM-1 levels was significantly higher (561 +/- 201 ng/ml) than that observed in 25 normal controls (353 +/- 162 ng/ml; P < 0.005); a clear correlation being found with Binet clinical stages (P = 0.026) and bone marrow (BM) histology (P < 0.005). We conclude that circulating ICAM-1 is elevated in CLL and such an increase reflects tumor mass as defined by clinical stages and BM histology, rather than peripheral blood lymphocytosis (r = 0.240). Even if soluble ICAM-1 appears to be less specifically increased that soluble CD23 serum levels, these circulating molecules were not completely independent of each other (r = 0.512; P < 0.001).","['Molica, S', 'Dattilo, A', 'Mannella, A', 'Levato, D', 'Levato, L']","['Molica S', 'Dattilo A', 'Mannella A', 'Levato D', 'Levato L']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Regionale A.

A mere 15 min pretreatment of HL60 cells with 10(-6) M bufalin, followed by incubation for 15 h without bufalin, caused fragmentation of DNA and a decrease in cell viability, indicating that the signal for induction of apoptosis is triggered rapidly upon treatment with bufalin. Bufalin-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells was inhibited by ZnCl2, an inhibitor of endonuclease, but not by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Northern blot analysis revealed that the levels of expression of the c-myc and bcl-2 genes in HL60 cells decreased with time after treatment with bufalin.

Therefore, disturbance of this cell cycle kinase by a specific monoclonal IgG1 anti-cdc2 antibody that specifically recognizes the product of the cdc2 gene, p34, was attempted. By using the surface p34 positive and rapidly proliferating HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and other standard techniques, it was found that the antibody, after an initial outer membrane attachment at 4 degrees C and entering the cells by raising the temperature to 37 degrees C, is directed and bound specifically on to the cell's nucleolus. This binding does not only demonstrate the intracellular localization of cdc2, but also appears to disturb its function. It thus induces a class II (HLA-DR) enhancement, increases the phagocytic ability of the cells and causes cellular elongation marked by a non-permanent adherence pattern. The results obtained are IgG independent and indicate that disturbance of constitutive cdc2 expression drives the cells to another level of maturation. The mechanisms behind these actions are still unknown. The results, however, may indicate that the regulatory pathways that govern the functioning of cell cycle stages are actively involved in the processes of cell differentiation. Similar findings have also been released where terminal murine erythro-differentiation may be achieved by manipulation of specific cell cycle kinases. On the contrary, normal already differentiated cdc2 negative human blood-derived monocytes remain insensitive to anti-cdc2 treatment, supporting the view that the presence of this kinase may be one of the reasons leading malignant cells to excessive growth, and that laboratory manipulation and reinfusion of these cells to leukemia patients may be a possible regimen for AML.","['Vassiliadis, S', 'Papadogiorgakis, S', 'Athanassakis, I']","['Vassiliadis S', 'Papadogiorgakis S', 'Athanassakis I']","['Department of Biology, University of Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Biological Transport', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['014521269500018J [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00018-j [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Aug;19(8):535-41. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00018-j.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-p53 antibodies have been detected in the sera of patients with leukemia, childhood lymphoma, or cancers such as those of the breast, lung, colon, esophagus, and liver (hepatocellular carcinoma). PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and time of appearance of serum anti-p53 antibodies during the pathogenesis of ASL associated with occupational exposure to vinyl chloride. METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) was used to detect anti-p53 antibodies in 148 serum samples from 92 individuals occupationally exposed (in France or in Kentucky) to vinyl chloride; 15 of these individuals (six from France and nine from Kentucky) had ASL. A subset of coded EIA-positive and EIA-negative sera was further analyzed for anti-p53 antibodies by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Nucleotide sequence analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was conducted on ASL DNA from six patients. We tested sera from 31 men who had no occupational exposure to vinyl chloride; they made up the control group. Statistical analyses were done using the Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared approximation and the Wilcoxon two-sample test for normal approximation. All P values result from two-sided tests. RESULTS: Fourteen serum samples (from nine individuals) were positive in the EIA. Five of the 15 individuals with ASL were positive for anti-p53 antibodies by EIA, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation: one individual at 11.3 and 10.8 years before diagnosis, another at 4 months before and shortly after diagnosis, and three when diagnosed or shortly thereafter. Four of the 77 vinyl chloride-exposed workers without diagnosed ASL were positive for anti-p53 antibodies; two of the four had symptoms related to vinyl chloride toxicity. Tumors from three of the six vinyl chloride-exposed workers from which sufficient DNA for analysis was obtained had A:T to T:A missense mutations of the p53 gene. Anti-p53 antibodies were detected in two of these individuals. Among the control group, two of 15 serum samples from 15 lung cancer patients and zero of 15 serum samples from control subjects without cancer had anti-p53 antibodies as substantially lower levels than the nine (10%) of 92 vinyl chloride-exposed workers who were positive for anti-p53 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Serum anti-p53 antibodies can predate clinical diagnosis of certain tumors, such as ASL, and may be useful in identifying individuals at high cancer risk, such as workers with occupational exposure to vinyl chloride.","['Trivers, G E', 'Cawley, H L', 'DeBenedetti, V M', 'Hollstein, M', 'Marion, M J', 'Bennett, W P', 'Hoover, M L', 'Prives, C C', 'Tamburro, C C', 'Harris, C C']","['Trivers GE', 'Cawley HL', 'DeBenedetti VM', 'Hollstein M', 'Marion MJ', 'Bennett WP', 'Hoover ML', 'Prives CC', 'Tamburro CC', 'Harris CC']","['Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Division of Cancer Etiology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*immunology', 'Hemangiosarcoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Time Factors', 'Vinyl Chloride/*adverse effects']",1995/09/20 00:00,1995/09/20 00:01,['1995/09/20 00:00'],"['1995/09/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/87.18.1400 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Sep 20;87(18):1400-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/87.18.1400.,['P20ES06832-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', 'WD06X94M2D (Vinyl Chloride)']",,,['TP53'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These novel agents contain a 1,3-diaryltriazene linker moiety, present in the established DNA minor groove-binder berenil [1,3-bis(4'-amidinophenyl)-triazene], which is attached to an intercalating acridine chromophore by a functionalized thiazole residue. This 9-arylacridine is predicted to confer rotational freedom to the hybrid molecule and thus facilitate bifunctional interaction with double-stranded DNA through a combination of 'classical' intercalation and minor groove-binding processes. The noncovalent DNA-binding properties of these acridine-triazene combilexins, together with the component molecular fragments, have been examined by fluorescence quenching and thermal denaturation studies with calf thymus DNA and two oligonucleotides, [poly(dA-dT)]2 and [poly(dG-dC)]2. In addition, the binding behaviors of these acridine compounds are compared to those of proflavine (3,6-diaminoacridine) and its 9-phenyl derivative. The results indicate that the hybrid agents (i) are more DNA-affinic than either molecular component, (ii) retain the AT-preferential binding properties of the parent difunctionalized 1,3-diaryltriazene residues, despite weak GC-preferential behavior associated with the acridine chromophore, and (iii) have a reduced binding affinity at pH 7 that reflects the protonation status of the acridine. In contrast, the more basic proflavines show much greater binding affinity and a marked preference for GC-rich DNA sequences. In vitro cytotoxicity data with L1210 mouse leukemia and A2780 human colon cancer cell lines show that the conjugate molecules are approximately 10-40-fold more potent than the acridine or triazene subunits and have activities that compare favorably with those of other reported synthetic combilexins. Intercalative binding modes with a model d(GATACGATAC).d(GTATCGTATC) target duplex have been investigated using molecular modeling techniques. These studies provide a rational basis for the binding properties and suggest that the prototype combilexins can bind in a bimodal manner that induces little distortion of the host DNA duplex. Energy-minimized models for the possible dual interactions are discussed.","['McConnaughie, A W', 'Jenkins, T C']","['McConnaughie AW', 'Jenkins TC']","['Cancer Research Campaign Biomolecular Structure Unit, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Acridines/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Diminazene/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Triazenes/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00018a009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1995 Sep 1;38(18):3488-501. doi: 10.1021/jm00018a009.,,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazenes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'JI8SAD85NO (diminazene aceturate)', 'Y5G36EEA5Z (Diminazene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently identified the SCLC surface antigen Cluster-4 (CL-4) to be identical to the B cell differentiation marker CD24, except for one amino acid residue. The CD24/CL-4 antigen is highly expressed on SCLC, but rarely on NSCLC cells. In order to investigate the influence of the expression of CD24/CL-4 on the radiation sensitivity in a non-leukaemic cell system, sublines of the human SCLC H249 cell line transfected with mutated ras oncogene, and differing in their CD24/CL-4 expression, were studied. In addition, we stably transfected the NSCLC A125 cell line and the mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cell line with the CL-4 cDNA. The differential expression of CD24/CL-4 on the cells had no influence on morphology, proliferation and cloning efficiency. Radiation studies were done with cells in exponential growth phase. In the highly resistant NSCLC A125 cells no difference in radioresponsiveness was observed between CD24/CL-4 expressing and non-expressing cells. In the rather radiosensitive cells, similar responses to radiation were observed between CD24/CL-4 expressing and non-expressing SCLC H249-ras cells, whereas the CL-4 transfected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts showed a substantially higher radioresistance than the CD24/CL-4 non-expressing control cells. In conclusion, the correlation between CD24/CL-4 expression and radiation sensitivity is controversial and depends on the cell type.","['Weber, E', 'Schmitter, D', 'Resch, H', 'Zarn, J A', 'Waibel, R', 'Mabry, M', 'Huguenin, P', 'Stahel, R A']","['Weber E', 'Schmitter D', 'Resch H', 'Zarn JA', 'Waibel R', 'Mabry M', 'Huguenin P', 'Stahel RA']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*physiopathology', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['D4H5K80Y1UAM0TAN [pii]', '10.1080/09553009514551111 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1995 Aug;68(2):205-13. doi: 10.1080/09553009514551111.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Cd24a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unique property provides a novel way of introducing cell surface receptors on live cell membranes without the use of gene transfection. Since any classical transmembrane cell surface protein can be converted to a GPI anchored protein by recombinant techniques, this method provides a means of studying ectodomain associated receptor functions on various cell types. Moreover, in some circumstances, it can be used to correct deficient cellular functions resulting from lack of cell surface protein expression. Using GPI-anchored Fc gamma receptor III (CD16B), a low affinity Fc gamma receptor, we have systematically studied the optimal conditions for reconstitution of a functional receptor on nucleated cells. CD16B is purified to homogeneity from neutrophil lysates by single step immunoaffinity chromatography. The purified CD16B is functionally active as evidenced by its ability to bind IgG opsonized erythrocytes. CD16B incorporation on nucleated cells is temperature dependent with an optimum of 37 degrees C. The level of expression of incorporated CD16B is also depend on the concentration of CD16B available and the duration of incubation. The incorporated CD16B retains its ability to bind ligand and also mediates endocytosis of the bound ligand. In summary, our results demonstrate that purified, functionally active GPI-anchored receptors can be expressed on desired cells in a controlled manner and retain some functional properties.","['Nagarajan, S', 'Anderson, M', 'Ahmed, S N', 'Sell, K W', 'Selvaraj, P']","['Nagarajan S', 'Anderson M', 'Ahmed SN', 'Sell KW', 'Selvaraj P']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/18 00:00,1995/08/18 00:01,['1995/08/18 00:00'],"['1995/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['002217599500095R [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(95)00095-r [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1995 Aug 18;184(2):241-51. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(95)00095-r.,['R29 AI30631/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, while the effects on erythropoiesis in normal animals were modest, TPO greatly expanded the number of erythroid progenitors and blood reticulocytes and was associated with accelerated red cell recovery in myelosuppressed mice.

The viral encoded protein tax, is thought to play an important role in oncogenesis. Our previous data obtained from a tax transgenic mouse model revealed that tax transforms mouse fibroblasts but not thymocytes, despite comparable levels of tax expression in both tissues. Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kD protein(s) was observed in the tax transformed fibroblast B line and in HTLV-1 transformed human lymphoid lines, but not in thymocytes from Thy-tax transgenic mice. Phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis with a set of Jak kinase specific antibodies, identified p130 as Jak2 in the tax transformed mouse fibroblastic cell line and Jak3 in HTLV-1 transformed human T cell lines. Phosphorylation of Jak2 in tax transformed cells resulted from high expression of IL-6.

In this study we show that physiological concentrations of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide methionine-enkephalin (MET-ENK) and the synthetic enkephalins D-Ala2, Me-Phe4, Gly(ol)5 and D-Ala2, D-Leu5 are stimulants for the in vitro migration of pre-B acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL) cells. Activation of the human pre-B ALL cell lines NALM 6 and LAZ 221 with MET-ENK resulted in both an increase in their migration and an augmentation in the surface expression of the leukemia cell marker CD9. The opiate receptor antagonist naloxone reversed these enkephalin-induced effects on the leukemia cells. When the pre-B ALL cells were preincubated with an anti-CD9 mAb before challenge with MET-ENK their migration to the enkephalin was markedly reduced. These studies show that endogenous and synthetic opioid peptides are stimulants for pre-B ALL cell migration and suggest that CD9 is important in the regulation of leukemia cell motility.","['Heagy, W', 'Duca, K', 'Finberg, R W']","['Heagy W', 'Duca K', 'Finberg RW']","['Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enkephalin, Methionine/pharmacology', 'Enkephalins/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118171 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Sep;96(3):1366-74. doi: 10.1172/JCI118171.,['R01A129657/PHS HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Enkephalins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', '58569-55-4 (Enkephalin, Methionine)']",,,,,PMC185758,,,,,,,,,,

Complete block of OM-induced KS cell growth and OM binding by anti-gp130 antibodies.,1319-27,"Oncostatin M (OM), which shares functional similarity and structural homology to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), functions as a potent growth factor for AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma-derived cells (AIDS-KS cells). OM was also suggested to bind to the LIF receptor (LIF/OM receptor), which consists of a signal transducing subunit for LIF and IL-6 (gp130) and a LIF receptor alpha-subunit. Recent studies indicate that IL-6 has growth-stimulating activity for AIDS-KS cells. However, we find that AIDS-KS cell growth is exclusively induced by OM and not by LIF or IL-6. We also observed the lack of binding properties of AIDS-KS cells for LIF and IL-6. Scatchard plots revealed the existence of two affinity classes of OM receptor sites on AIDS-KS cells, with Kd values of 6-12 pM (high affinity) and 521-815 pM (low affinity). In competition binding studies, we find that the OM-specific receptor, but not the LIF/OM receptor, contributes to the OM-specific growth stimulation of AIDS-KS cells. We also noted that anti-gp130 antibodies can completely abolish OM-induced growth stimulation of AIDS-KS cells as well as OM binding to AIDS-KS cells. PCR amplification clearly revealed high levels of gp130 expression in AIDS-KS cells, while the transcript of LIF receptor alpha-subunit or IL-6 receptor alpha-subunit was not observed. Therefore, we conclude that (a) AIDS-KS cells express the OM-specific receptor with high and low affinity, but not the LIF/OM receptor; (b) gp130 on AIDS-KS cells plays a key role in OM binding and signaling on the OM-specific receptor; and (c) the lack of biological response of AIDS-KS cells to IL-6 and LIF can be explained by the absence of the IL-6 and LIF/OM receptors. All this evidence shows the correlation of OM-specific biological activity with expression of the OM-specific receptor and the involvement of gp130 on this receptor, as based on findings in in vitro growth assays and binding experiments for AIDS-KS cells.","['Murakami-Mori, K', 'Taga, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Nakamura, S']","['Murakami-Mori K', 'Taga T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Nakamura S']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine and Technology, Huntington Memorial Hospital, Pasadena, California 91105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', '*Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*etiology/*metabolism']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118167 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Sep;96(3):1319-27. doi: 10.1172/JCI118167.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",,,,,PMC185754,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified two potentially important cytokines by demonstrating that parathyroid hormone induces expression by osteoblasts of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor without affecting levels of 14 other cytokines. Although parathyroid hormone activates multiple signal transduction pathways, induction of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor is dependent on activation of adenyl cyclase. This study demonstrates that adenyl cyclase is also required for stimulation of osteoclast activity in cultures containing osteoclasts from rat long bones and UMR106-01 rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells. Since the stimulation by parathyroid hormone of both cytokine production and bone resorption depends on the same signal transduction pathway, we hypothesized that IL-6 might be a downstream effector of parathyroid hormone. We found that addition of exogenous IL-6 mimics the ability of parathyroid hormone to stimulate bone resorption. More importantly, an antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor blocks moderate stimulation of osteoclast activity induced by the hormone. Interestingly, strong stimulation of resorption overcomes this dependence on IL-6. Thus, parathyroid hormone likely induces multiple, redundant cytokines that can overcome the IL-6 requirement associated with moderate stimulation. Taken together with studies showing that many other bone resorptive agents also stimulate IL-6 production, our results suggest that IL-6 may be a downstream effector of these agents as well as of parathyroid hormone.","['Greenfield, E M', 'Shaw, S M', 'Gornik, S A', 'Banks, M A']","['Greenfield EM', 'Shaw SM', 'Gornik SA', 'Banks MA']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-5000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms', '*Bone Resorption', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Interleukin/immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Teriparatide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118157 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Sep;96(3):1238-44. doi: 10.1172/JCI118157.,['AR-41674/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '10T9CSU89I (Teriparatide)', '51257-86-4 (parathyroid hormone (3-34))', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",,,,,PMC185744,,,,,,,,,,

Complete extraction of p130 required a high concentration of salt (0.5 M NaCl) indicating that it binds firmly to the nucleolar components via ionic interaction. p130 is heavily phosphorylated, since alkaline phosphatase treatment converted the purified p130 into a 95 kDa product; this was further supported by the in vitro demonstration that cellular phosphatase and casein kinase II activities were responsible for the interchange of these two forms. Extracts of mitotic cells had lower concentrations of p130 compared to those of interphase cells suggesting that a proportion of p130 might be degraded during mitosis. Moreover, all the remaining p130 in mitotic cells was further phosphorylated, likely by a cdc2 kinase, resulting in increase in its solubility, and its dispersion throughout the entire cytoplasm. Thus, p130 in metaphase and anaphase cells was unable to be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. At telophase, p130 reappeared and aggregated into a granular structure, resembling the prenucleolar bodies. These granules migrated from the nucleoplasm to the nucleoli in early G1-phase. Actinomycin D was able to induce segregation of p130-containing granules into the nucleoplasm, similar to the well-known behavior of the fibrillarin-containing granules, indicating that p130 is localized in the dense fibrillar component, a subnucleolar region for pre-rRNA synthesis and processing. The cDNA sequence of p130 revealed a remarkable feature, that a serine-rich stretch interspersed with acidic residues is repeated ten times. Such a characteristic is shared with a rat nucleolar phosphoprotein Nopp140, which is thought to shuttle between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm. Although p130 shows 74% identity to Nopp140, our observations suggest that during mitosis the functions of p130 are related to nucleologenesis.","['Pai, C Y', 'Chen, H K', 'Sheu, H L', 'Yeh, N H']","['Pai CY', 'Chen HK', 'Sheu HL', 'Yeh NH']","['Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Life Science, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Nuclear Proteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1995 May;108 ( Pt 5):1911-20.,,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (nucleolar phosphoprotein p130)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",,['GENBANK/Z34289'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to examine the role of PTP further in these processes by characterizing the effects of bis(maltolato)-oxovanadium(IV) (BMLOV), previously known to be a nontoxic insulin mimetic agent in vivo. BMLOV was found to be a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. BMLOV induced cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in B cells in a pattern similar to that observed following antigen receptor stimulation, whereas little tyrosine phosphorylation was induced in T cells. In B cells, BMLOV treatment resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and phospholipase C gamma 2, while sIgM-induced signals were inhibited. By contrast, T cell receptor signals were moderately increased by BMLOV, and the cells displayed greater induction of IL-2 receptor without toxicity. The compound selectively induced apoptosis in B cell lymphoma and myeloid leukemia cell lines, but not in T cell leukemia or colon carcinoma cells. Interleukin-4 plus anti-CD40 antibody treatment of normal human peripheral B cells rescued the cells from BMLOV-induced death. These results suggest that phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors can activate B cell signal pathways in a lineage-specific manner, resulting in desensitization of receptor-mediated signaling and induction of apoptosis.","['Schieven, G L', 'Wahl, A F', 'Myrdal, S', 'Grosmaire, L', 'Ledbetter, J A']","['Schieven GL', 'Wahl AF', 'Myrdal S', 'Grosmaire L', 'Ledbetter JA']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, Washington 98121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin M/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Mice', 'Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.35.20824 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)90459-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Sep 1;270(35):20824-31. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.35.20824.,,"['0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (secretory IgM)', '38213-69-3 (bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV))', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basal cAMP-kinase activity modulates interleukin-1 beta action.,20599-607,"Novel (Rp)-cAMPS analogs differed widely in ability to antagonize cAMP activation of pure cAMP-dependent protein kinase I and II and to antagonize actions of cAMP on gene expression, shape change, apoptosis, DNA replication, and protein phosphorylation in intact cells. These differences were related to different abilities of the analogs to stabilize the holoenzyme form relative to the dissociated form of cAMP kinase type I and II. (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS and (Rp)-8-Cl-cAMPS were the most potent cAMP antagonists for isolated type I kinase and for cells expressing mostly type I kinase, like IPC-81 leukemia cells, fibroblasts transfected with type I regulatory subunit (RI), and primary hepatocytes. It is proposed that (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS or (Rp)-8-Cl-cAMPS should replace (Rp)-cAMPS as the first line cAMP antagonist, particularly for studies in cells expressing predominantly type I kinase. The phosphorylation of endogenous hepatocyte proteins was affected oppositely by (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS and increased cAMP, indicating that (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS inhibited basal cAMP-kinase activity. The inhibition of basal kinase activity was accompanied by enhanced DNA replication, an effect which could be reproduced by microinjected mutant cAMP-subresponsive RI. It is concluded that the basal cAMP-kinase activity exerts a tonic inhibition of hepatocyte replication. (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS and microinjected RI also desensitized hepatocytes toward inhibition of DNA synthesis by interleukin-1 beta. This indicates that basal cAMP-kinase activity can have a permissive role for the action of another (interleukin-1 beta) signaling pathway.","['Gjertsen, B T', 'Mellgren, G', 'Otten, A', 'Maronde, E', 'Genieser, H G', 'Jastorff, B', 'Vintermyr, O K', 'McKnight, G S', 'Doskeland, S O']","['Gjertsen BT', 'Mellgren G', 'Otten A', 'Maronde E', 'Genieser HG', 'Jastorff B', 'Vintermyr OK', 'McKnight GS', 'Doskeland SO']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thionucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.35.20599 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)90428-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Sep 1;270(35):20599-607. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.35.20599.,"['GM 32875/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'ML 44948/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', ""23645-17-2 (adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioate)"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An AUG codon governs the synthesis of the retroviral capsid proteins precursor, whereas a CUG codon directs the synthesis of a glycosylated cell surface antigen, the gross cell surface antigen. Control of the relative synthesis of the two precursors is crucial for MuLV infectivity and pathology. Furthermore, the MuLV mRNA leader sequence is very long and should inhibit translation according to the classical scanning model. This suggests a different translation initiation mechanism allowing gag efficient expression. We demonstrate, by using bicistronic vectors expressed in COS-7 cells, that the Mo-MuLV mRNA leader drives translation initiation by internal ribosome entry. We have localized the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) between the two initiation codons. This 126 nucleotide long IRES implies an oligopyrimidine tract located 45 nucleotides upstream of AUG codon. UV cross-linking and affinity chromatography experiments show that the PTB/p57 splicing factor specifically interacts with this oligopyrimidine tract.

In present work, we have studied the specificity of nucleolar and euchromatic gene long-range fragmentation in mouse and human cells triggered to undergo apoptosis either by tumor necrosis factor or by serum deprivation. Separation of the excised large DNA fragments by pulsed field gel electrophoresis followed by Southern analysis has demonstrated that in all cases studied the above fragmentation proceeds in a specific way. Furthermore, the patterns of DNA long-range fragmentation in the cells undergoing apoptosis were indistinguishable from the patterns of DNA cleavage into chromosomal loops by the high salt-insoluble topoisomerase II of the nuclear matrix.

Since overexpression of normal N-ras is also transforming in vitro, the N-ras promoter of AML patients was analyzed for the presence of promoter mutations that may affect expression of the N-ras gene. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was used to analyze samples from 26 AML patients and 13 normal subjects. A novel polymorphism at position 390 within the N-ras promoter was observed in both AML patients and normal samples at an overall frequency of 26%. In addition, two of 26 patients had single-base substitutions within protein binding sites that altered the binding of transcription factors to the promoter. One patient had a T-->A mutation at position 520 within an AP-1 binding site; the other had an A-->G mutation at position 409 within a protein binding region adjacent to a Myb binding site.

Our previous studies demonstrated that LTMCs containing FeLV-infected stromal cells generated two- to three-fold higher numbers of total nonadherent cells and nonadherent granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) compared with uninfected LTMCs. In the present studies, CFU-GM and primitive erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) bound equivalently to FeLV-infected or uninfected LTMC stromal cells in a 2-hour adherence assay. In recharge LTMC studies, the numbers of adherent CFU-GM maintained in cultures containing stromal cells infected with FeLV-A/61E were not significantly different from controls (range 84-191% of uninfected control cultures, p > 0.1); however, the percentages of adherent CFU-GM in S phase of the cell cycle were consistently increased (range 42-62% compared with controls, range 5-23%). FeLV infection had no significant effect on the cell-cycle status of the nonadherent CFU-GM in LTMCs. Agar co-culture assays revealed that multilineage colony-stimulating activity was constitutively and equivalently produced by feeder cell layers consisting of either uninfected or FeLV-infected irradiated heterogeneous LTMC stromal cells, homogeneous marrow stromal fibroblasts, or a fibroendothelial marrow stromal cell line. However, FeLV infection significantly attenuated the soluble progenitor growth-inhibitory activity associated with higher densities of these stromal cells. Assays of conditioned medium from cultures of irradiated stromal cells demonstrated that FeLV infection or hydrocortisone exposure decreased the utilization of glucose, the production of acidic metabolic products, and the constitutive production of active and latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) bioactivity and TGF-beta 2 immunoreactivity. Levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were undetectable and unchanged in CM samples. Together, these observations suggest that downmodulation of TGF-alpha and/or the basal metabolic status of stromal cells may be responsible for the high basal proliferative activity of adherent CFU-GM in FeLV-infected LTMCs, and by extension, that retroviral infection in vivo could alter hematopoiesis by perturbing the progenitor growth-regulatory and -supportive function of marrow stromal cells.","['Linenberger, M L', 'Dow, S W', 'Abkowitz, J L']","['Linenberger ML', 'Dow SW', 'Abkowitz JL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Sep;23(10):1069-79.,"['DK31232/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02396/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL31823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As on circulating leukocytes, the integrins expressed on U937 or K562 cells were expressed in a constitutively inactive state, as demonstrated by the lack of adhesion to their cellular counterreceptors or soluble ligands, the absence of CD18-dependent intercellular aggregation, and their inability to mediate adhesion to protein-coated plates. However, while leukocyte integrin adhesive functions in U937 cells were induced upon treatment with cellular agonists (e.g., PMA), their function in K562 cells could be upregulated only with activating monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating the cell-type-specific regulation of the adhesive capabilities of the three leukocyte integrins in hematopoietic cellular environment. On the other hand, the expression of either CD11b/CD18 or CD11c/CD18 in U937 myeloid cells before induction of differentiation greatly affected the adhesive phenotype of differentiating cells by abrogating the CD11a/CD18-CD54-dependent homotypic aggregation. Unlike that of mock-transfected U937 cells, differentiation of CD11b/CD18- or CD11c/CD18-transfected U937 cells led to cell adhesion and spreading on the tissue culture plates, with an almost total absence of homotypic aggregates. These results confirm the role of CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 in myeloid cell adhesion and spreading and suggest that the CD11b/- and CD11c/CD18-mediated recognition of substrate-bound ligands competes or interferes with LFA-1-dependent intercellular adhesion.","['Nueda, A', 'Lopez-Rodriguez, C', 'Rubio, M A', 'Sotillos, M', 'Postigo, A', 'del Pozo, M A', 'Vega, M A', 'Corbi, A L']","['Nueda A', 'Lopez-Rodriguez C', 'Rubio MA', 'Sotillos M', 'Postigo A', 'del Pozo MA', 'Vega MA', 'Corbi AL']","['Hospital de la Princesa, CSIC, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/*metabolism', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/*metabolism']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008874985711574 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1995.1157 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Sep;164(2):163-9. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1995.1157.,,"['0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of a panel of normal lymphoid cells expressed the MAGE gene family. As revealed by the primers specific for each of the MAGE genes, the MAGE-1, -2, -3, -4 or -6 gene was expressed in 8, 8, 6, 2, or 6 respectively out of 23 types of leukemia cell lines. Expression of the MAGE-1 protein in both the cell lines and patients' cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with the polyclonal antibody to recombinant MAGE-1 protein. Cellular MAGE-4 protein in the cell lines was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to recombinant MAGE-4b protein. In summary, the MAGE gene family was found to be expressed in the substantial proportion of T cell leukemias, but in no case of myelomonocytic leukemia.

In addition to the main abnormalities, we have shown additional complex abnormalities in 14 of 16 cases. Among these, chromosome 3 was the most commonly involved, affecting the short or long arm or the whole chromosome; 5 of the 16 cases involved breakpoint 3q21.

Cells were activated with antigen or the calcium ionophore A23187, whether or not in combination with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Oxatomide, hydroxyzine and cetirizine inhibit the antigen induced beta-hexosaminidase release. The release triggered by A23187, whether or not in combination with TPA is hardly influenced by the compounds. A biphasic dependence of the inhibition of exocytosis in RBL cells on lipophilicity is observed with the optimum at log P is 5-6. The extremely lipophilic compounds meclozine and buclizine are not active in this model. pH dependence of the effect of the drugs shows that especially the uncharged species are active in inhibiting exocytosis. The investigated compounds show an effect on phase transitions in L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine dipalmitoyl liposomes as assayed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For the less extremely lipophilic compounds the induced changes in the phospholipid membranes increased with lipophilicity. The relation between structural features of the drug and the interaction with phospholipids is discussed in view of the DSC results. We conclude that location of the active drugs at the membrane or the membrane/protein interface is important for the inhibiting activity on exocytosis. This could affect several membrane related processes, which are abundant in the early phases of the IgE-mediated signal transduction process.","['Fischer, M J', 'Paulussen, J J', 'Horbach, D A', 'Roelofsen, E P', 'van Miltenburg, J C', 'de Mol, N J', 'Janssen, L H']","['Fischer MJ', 'Paulussen JJ', 'Horbach DA', 'Roelofsen EP', 'van Miltenburg JC', 'de Mol NJ', 'Janssen LH']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

We therefore conducted a prospective study of the incidence and clinical features of influenza infection in patients with acute or chronic leukemia. The cohort, which consisted of all adult leukemia patients undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy during the 1991-1992 influenza epidemic, was followed prospectively for development of signs and symptoms of acute infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract. Of these 294 patients, 111 received chemotherapy as inpatients and 183 as outpatients. Throat swabs and nasal washes for viral culture were obtained from all symptomatic patients, who were then followed until all signs and symptoms resolved. Symptoms of respiratory tract infection developed in 37 leukemia patients (13%). Among these, influenza (A/Beijing/ H3N2) caused 3 (21%) of the 14 infections that developed during hospitalization but only 1 (4%) of the 23 that developed in the community (P = 0.14). Influenza patients presented with fever, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headache, and myalgia; those with other infections presented with signs and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (productive cough, rales, or rhonchi). Development of pneumonia was common in influenza patients, 1 of whom died from secondary fungal and gram-negative pneumonia. Influenza A virus infections accounted for a substantial portion of acute respiratory infections among adult leukemia patients during a community epidemic. Most infections appeared to be nosocomial and the most likely sources were visitors or hospital personnel. Immunization of household contacts and hospital staff may reduce the risk of influenza infection and its pulmonary complications in leukemia patients.","['Elting, L S', 'Whimbey, E', 'Lo, W', 'Couch, R', 'Andreeff, M', 'Bodey, G P']","['Elting LS', 'Whimbey E', 'Lo W', 'Couch R', 'Andreeff M', 'Bodey GP']","['Department of Medical Specialities, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community-Acquired Infections/epidemiology/virology', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/virology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Influenza A virus', 'Influenza, Human/*epidemiology/virology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Texas/epidemiology']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00368891 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 1995 May;3(3):198-202. doi: 10.1007/BF00368891.,['N01-AI-15103/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been clearly shown that graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is accompanied by a graft-versus-leukemia reaction (GVLR) which reduces the incidence of leukemia relapse. To date, discussion is still going on as to whether GVHD and GVLR are either two different reactions or are exerting their effects through the same mechanism(s). In two rat leukemia models, namely the Brown Norway acute myelocytic leukemia (BNML) and the WAG/Rij acute lymphocytic leukemia L4415, total body irradiation (TBI) was given to induce a state of so-called minimal residual disease (MRD). Subsequently, it was attempted to evoke a GVLR distinct from GVHD by using semi-allogeneic hybrid-to-parent or parent-to-hybrid BMT, with or without the addition of graded numbers of lymphocytes. In both leukemia models applying hybrid-to-parent BMT, the addition of high numbers of semi-allogeneic lymphocytes to the semi-allogeneic graft had no antileukemic effect. In parent-to-hybrid BMT, the grafts sharing their alloantigens with the leukemia cells did not induce an anti-leukemic effect, irrespective of the number of lymphocytes present in the graft or the induction of evident GVHD. When the parental graft was histoincompatible with the leukemia cells, transplantation of bone marrow alone induced a significant increase in life span correlating with 2.8 log leukemia cell kill (LCK).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kloosterman, T C', 'Martens, A C', 'van Bekkum, D W', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Kloosterman TC', 'Martens AC', 'van Bekkum DW', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*physiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1995 Apr;15(4):583-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further study the control of this enzyme, we examined the activity in pig, rat and human colonic tissues, and several human cancer cell lines. The enzyme was difficult to solubilize by detergents and was extremely unstable in the solubilized form. Using synthetic derivatives of the GalNAc-R substrate, we showed that the specificity of the enzyme in normal rat and human colonic mucosa requires all the substituents of the GalNAc-sugar ring of substrates for maximal activity. Core 3 beta 3-GlcNAc-T was significantly influenced by the structure of the aglycon group. None of the inactive substrate derivatives could inhibit the activity. N-Iodoacetamido-galactosamine alpha-benzyl was a weak substrate and significantly inhibited the incorporation of GLcNAc into GalNAc alpha-benzyl by human colonic homogenates. Surprisingly, none of the colonic cancer cell lines or any other cancer and leukaemia cells examined exhibited detectable activity of the enzyme, although a number of other glycosyltransferase activities involved in O-glycan biosynthesis were active. Mixing experiments did not reveal an endogenous inhibitor in HL60 cells or an activator of core 3 beta 3-GlcNAc-T in human colonic mucosa. Thus, the lack of core 3 beta 3-GlcNAc-T in human colonic mucosa.

However, with DNR and Hoechst 33342, an incorporation of these dyes was exhibited in resistant cells. This phenomenon was not observed with Rh 123, which makes it possible to distinguish clearly between sensitive and resistant cells and to detect as few as 1% of resistant cells. Because of its high sensitivity, the functional test involving incorporation of Rh 123 was successfully used in acute myeloid leukemia to detect multichemoresistant cells.","['Lizard, G', 'Maynadie, M', 'Roignot, P', 'Lizard-Nacol, S', 'Poupon, M F']","['Lizard G', 'Maynadie M', 'Roignot P', 'Lizard-Nacol S', 'Poupon MF']","['Centre commun de cytometrie en flux, Inserm U80, hopital E Herriot, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0007-4551(96)81513-X [pii]'],ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1995 Mar;82(3):211-7.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 51-year-old man diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia was treated with standard induction chemotherapy. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated 2 days postchemotherapy; however, the patient continued to be febrile until day 7. At this time amphotericin B 35 mg/250 mL D5W over 4 hours was administered. Despite premedication, the patient experienced severe rigors, chills, and fever. As the result of continuing infusion-related adverse events, the patient refused further therapy after the third daily dose. In an attempt to reduce the infusion-related events, a trial of amphotericin B 35 mg/35 mL of fat emulsion 20% was administered over 2 hours after patient consent was obtained. Premedication was administered and the patient tolerated therapy without adverse events. Amphotericin B dosage escalations to 50 and 70 mg were tolerated similarly. During this treatment the patient became afebrile and the serum creatinine concentration decreased to normal. DISCUSSION: Despite significant toxicities and the development of newer antifungal agents, amphotericin B remains the drug of choice for the empiric coverage of suspected fungal infection in neutropenic patients. Amphotericin B often exacerbates the nephrotoxicity of other agents characteristically prescribed in these patients. Furthermore, infusion-related events, if not intolerable, can dramatically reduce the patient's quality of life. For these reasons, novel means of amphotericin B administration are being explored. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of amphotericin B in a lipid diluent may have substantial benefit in reducing the nephrotoxicity and infusion-related events associated with the antifungal. Prospective clinical trial comparing lipid-complexed amphotericin B with liposomal and approved formulations of amphotericin B are essential to define potential differences in toxicity and efficacy.","['Anderson, R P', 'Clark, D A']","['Anderson RP', 'Clark DA']","['Pharmacy Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Albuquerque, NM 87108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Fat Emulsions, Intravenous/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809502900509 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1995 May;29(5):496-500. doi: 10.1177/106002809502900509.,,"['0 (Fat Emulsions, Intravenous)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
